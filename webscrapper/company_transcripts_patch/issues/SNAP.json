At this time participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap, Inc's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO.", "Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the third quarter of 2017, which can be found on our Investor Relations' website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our third quarter 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement.

This information can also be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available.", "Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com. At times in our prepared comments, or in response to questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call. As we are rapidly approaching the end of 2017, I thought it might be useful to speak to our progress against the three priorities I shared earlier this year; performance, quality, and automation, and discuss our three new priorities for 2018; user growth, content, and augmented reality. We have been very focused on making progress against performance, quality, and automation this year, and are beginning to see the results of these efforts. Application performance has increased considerably, and we have made meaningful progress against key customer facing metrics.", "For example, since April, we have reduced the average time it takes for Android users to start our camera application by over 20%. Camera startup time is very important for Snapchat because people use our service to quickly capture moments to share with friends. As part of our quality efforts, we have been building a new world-class device lab for test automation and quality assurance. We've also distributed a wide variety of Android handsets across our engineering organization to ensure that we have ongoing qualitative feedback on Android application performance and design.", "In Q3 alone, Snapchat was used on over 60,000 different Android model variants. Given the sheer volume of different Android handsets used to access Snapchat, we have had to establish new processes to ensure that our quality efforts can be maintained. This will be an ongoing investment, but I am pleased to say that this quarter, monthly crash rates across both iOS and Android reached an all-time low since we started tracking this metric early last year.", "Our efforts at automation have gained traction very quickly this year, with 80% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically in Q3, up from zero%, one year ago. The speed of this transition surpassed our expectations, but has dramatically reduced pricing as advertisers move from direct sales to our unreserved auction. This has decreased CPMs more than 60% year-over-year, which has made it harder to grow revenues at the rate we would have liked. I am grateful that this transition is nearly behind us, and look forward to the many advantages our programmatic auction brings to our advertising business in terms of scale and ROI.", "The number of advertisers spending in our auction grew nearly 5 times from the beginning of the quarter, one of the many early indicators that our self-serve tools are making it easier for more advertisers to reach our audience. I'm excited about the case studies that Imran will share with you a bit later in the call.", "The substantial decline in average CPMs during our transition to the auction has meant that the majority of our revenue growth has come from a dramatic increase in impressions. This has been a good test for our business, because we are always concerned that an increase in ad load will negatively impact user engagement. Fortunately, we have seen user engagement continue to grow at a meaningful clip, with time spent, frequency of use, and Snap creation all increasing, while Snap Ad impressions have grown over 400% year-over-year. This increase in ad impressions combined with the simultaneous growth in user engagement bodes well for the long-term success of our advertising business. Of course, overall ad load remains very low, and we will continue to monitor user engagement as ad load increases over time.", "I am proud of our team for executing relentlessly against our priorities in 2017, and I feel that we have built a solid foundation for the future. Looking ahead to 2018, our team is focused on user growth, content, and augmented reality.", "This quarter, we grew our Daily active users at a lower rate than we would have liked, adding 4.5 million new users. This can be partially attributed to our decision to report our daily active users as an average over the entire quarter, where a strong September was offset by the more modest months of July and August. Ultimately though, we want to drive more user growth in 2018.", "We are fortunate to grow our business from a position of strength with a young audience in the developed world, the tip of the spear that drives broader adoption trends across the technology ecosystem. For example, we now reach over 70% of the 13 to 34 year-old population in the U.S., France, the U.K., and Australia. However, in order to further scale our user base, we need to accelerate the adoption of our product among Android users, users above the age of 34, and users in the Rest of the World markets. This means that we will have to make some changes to our product and business.", "To attract more Android users, we are building a new version of our Android application from the ground up that we will launch in select markets before rolling it out widely. This new version of our application leverages everything we have learned about building for Android over the past five years, to provide a more performant product experience that we know our community will appreciate. This effort requires significant engineering resources across all of our engineering teams and will be a huge focus over the coming year. After seeing the results of increasing Android performance over the past few months, with significantly more Android users added than iOS users in September, we wish we had done this sooner.", "The one thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback. As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use. There is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application. We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business.", "High-speed and affordable wireless connectivity is necessary for the use of our application, and this has proven to be an obstacle for growth in the Rest of World markets. We are taking action both internally and externally to improve connectivity for our community. Internally, we are focused on product improvements like our new streaming architecture for Story playback. This updated architecture means that we no longer have to download an entire video file before we initiate playback, which ultimately results in a better user experience and more efficient use of the network. Externally, we are exploring partnerships with select wireless carriers who can help us to provide our service at a lower cost to our community.", "Content is becoming an increasingly important part of our business, as many of our early investments and partnerships have begun to bear fruit. It has been nearly three years since we launched Publisher Stories, and I have been so excited to see the tremendous progress we have made together with our partners. Additionally, Our Story has grown from a one-off event-based product to an always-on content experience, discoverable first in Stories and now in Search and Maps.", "Our coverage of the recent hurricanes in the United States demonstrated the breadth of the Snapchat content experience, with unique perspectives across Publisher Stories, Shows, Our Stories, and the Snap Maps. Over 3,500 hours of storm-related Snaps were submitted to Our Story, providing an intimate and near real-time perspective of those devastating events. We heard that many users that had evacuated the area were able to keep an eye on their neighborhoods using Snap Maps.", "Professional journalism continues to play an important role on Snapchat, and provides important context to user-submitted Snaps. Stay Tuned, a twice-daily show produced by NBC, reached over 12 million, 13 to 24 year-old viewers in the United States in September, making it one of the most popular news shows for young people in the country, almost overnight.", "As part of the redesign I mentioned earlier, we are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day. We think that there is a big opportunity to surface some of this content in a personalized and more relevant way, while still maintaining the exploratory nature of our service. We are developing a new solution that provides each of our 178 million daily active users with their own stories experience, leveraging the tremendous benefits of machine learning without compromising the editorial integrity of the Stories platform that we have worked so hard to build.", "As part of our efforts around Search and Maps, we now index millions of stories every day, meaning we have the long tail of content necessary to provide a truly personal experience. We hope that showing the right stories to the right audience will help grow engagement and monetization for our partners and for Snapchat.", "While we have made significant progress in our work to empower the creation of user-generated content from friends, and premium content from publishers, we have historically neglected the creator community on Snapchat that creates and distributes public stories for the broader Snapchat audience. In 2018, we are going to build more distribution and monetization opportunities for these creators in an effort to empower our creative community to express themselves to a larger audience and build a business with their creativity.", "Developing this ecosystem will allow artists to transition more easily from communicating with friends to creating stories for a broader audience, monetizing their stories, and potentially using our professional tools to create premium content. Snapchat has likely become the world's most-used camera, with more than 3.5 billion Snaps created every day, up more than 40% year-over-year. According to InfoTrends, this is now greater than the average number of photographs taken every day this year across all phones, tablets, and digital cameras combined, excluding Snapchat. The strength of our close friend network that drives high frequency engagement means that our community opens our application an average of 25 times per day, creating numerous opportunities to inspire creativity.", "Augmented reality is one of the many ways that we inspire our community to create Snaps. With the tap of a finger, lenses transform the world around you and make even the most boring of situations infinitely more snappable. In September, we released 3D Bitmojis, which have increased the use of world lenses by more than 20%. In October, we collaborated with Jeff Koons to place installations of his iconic sculptures in locations around the world, and more recently, we've helped the NBA create unique characters to bring team spirit to their arenas around the United States.", "With all of the excitement and creativity inspired by each new lens on Snapchat, we are working hard to democratize lens creation so that anyone anywhere can create and publish their own lenses. We have been testing our Lens Studio product with a select group of advertising and creative partners, who have already created amazing lenses with our tools. We'll be investing in improving our own platform and tools, as well as making our Lens Studio more widely available to empower the creativity of our community, much in the way that we have with our Geofilters product. With over 5 million Geofilters submitted in the past two years, we can't wait to see all of the lenses created by our community.", "Context Cards represent the next generation of our augmented reality products, with information and actions overlaid on the content that our community is watching. We will be building on top of the Context Cards framework with additional partners as we learn more from our community about how they want to use this new product. With all of the snaps and stories viewed on our service every day, Context Cards provide a unique opportunity to translate what you see on the screen into action, whether online or in the world around you.", "2018 promises to be a productive and exciting year for Snap, with many changes coming to our products and platform. We will be hard at work delivering on our priorities; user growth, content, and augmented reality.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Imran to discuss our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $204 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter. This represents healthy growth, but we're working tirelessly because we want to grow revenue faster. I want to focus my time today on a few factors that we believe have set us up well for strong growth in the future quarters. One, transitioning the majority of our business to self-serve; two, addressing the needs of our increasingly diverse advertiser mix; and three, democratizing our Sponsored Creative Tools so that all advertisers can use them. I'll talk about how each of these factors challenged us and what we are doing to address them.", "First, we have been focused over the past year on transitioning the majority of our Snap Ads business to self-serve. We launched our Ads API a year ago. This marked the beginning of our transition to programmatic advertising. We followed it in June with our own self-service tool. The transition to self-serve is an important part of scaling our business for a number of strategic reasons. For instance, in our auction platform, advertisers can now specify and optimize delivery against certain business objectives, such as driving app installs or video views. With this framework, we can address the needs of many more advertisers and help them achieve their desired business goals at scale. We have also made it easier for advertisers to test and learn. The auction has lowered the entry price point by three orders of magnitude, making it more accessible to all advertisers. And, our self-serve tools have made it possible to manage campaigns with ongoing testing and real-time improvements.", "Given these strategic reasons, we have been very aggressively transitioning our Snap Ad, or full-screen mobile video business to self-serve. And advertisers' adoption has been tremendous. Today, over 80% of Snap Ad impressions are being delivered programmatically. This is up nearly 3 times from Q1 of this year and up from 60% since last quarter. However, our auction has a lower price-point than our reserved business because there is no fixed rate card. As we transition more and more of our business to the auction, this had a meaningful impact on overall pricing.", "While this diminishes revenue in the short term, it builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue. As we onboard more advertisers and multiple advertisers compete for the same ad impression, we should see higher pricing. In fact, we are already seeing this happen in some auction segments. The number of advertisers spending in the auction is up nearly 5 times since the beginning of the quarter. This has resulted in sequential growth in the number of contested auctions, and our data shows that these prices are, on average, higher than uncontested auctions.", "Increasing the number of advertisers on Snapchat is foundational to building an efficient marketplace, and our self-serve tools help us do this at scale. More advertisers, means a greater variety of ads which is a win-win situation for both our advertisers and our community because it helps us to deliver the right ad to the right person. We are confident that increasing the number of advertisers, combined with our ongoing machine learning efforts, will lead to better results for our advertisers, better experiences for our community, and higher pricing for us in the long-term.", "I would like to share an example of how our self-service auction platform is helping our customers achieve their objectives. Peak Labs, a U.K.-based brain training app, leveraged our auction for an app install campaign. They developed over 10 different Snap Ad creatives to keep the ads fresh and engaging. Using the auction's real-time reporting capabilities, Peak was able to rotate creatives on a bi-weekly basis, analyze performance via A/B tests, and optimize efficiency for the overall campaign. Results were great. After two months, Peak drove 1.7 million app installs at a cost per install that was 50% lower than other platforms where they were advertising.", "The second area of focus for us is addressing the needs of our increasingly diverse advertiser mix. As we onboard more advertisers, it is critical that we understand the nuances of each vertical and customer type. Last year, we were focused on large advertisers, over half of our revenue in 2016 was tied to large share of voice or sponsorship deals. Many of these customers wanted third-party measurement solutions and, as a result, we invested heavily in this area. We have made good progress. We now have over 18 third-party measurement partners, and more than half of every dollar spent on our platform has third-party measurement attached to it.", "Here's an example of how our third-party measurement helped an advertiser achieve their business goals. 2K was looking to drive awareness and purchase intent of their NBA 2K18 video game using Snap Ads and Lenses. Through our partnership with Nielsen, they were able to measure the results that mattered most. Among users who were exposed to both the Snap Ads and Lenses, they achieved a 45-point lift in awareness and a 24-point lift in intent to purchase the game.", "Additionally, our acquisition of Placed represents our commitment to open-source attribution. Over 90% of retail transactions still happen offline in the physical world. Placed standardizes the omni-channel measurement of store visits and enables advertisers to understand performance that goes beyond a walled garden. It ensures that advertisers can understand performance in the context of their entire budget. In Q3 alone, Placed measured campaigns for more than 300 advertisers.", "The vast majority of businesses in the United States are small-to-medium sized, and don't have access to television advertising or Madison Avenue. With the launch of our self-service platform, we are investing heavily in expanding our existing advertiser base to include long-tail and mid-tail advertisers. We're seeing great traction. We more than tripled revenue from SMBs in the third quarter when compared to the first half of 2017. But to unlock the true potential of this segment, we need to invest in first-party measurement solutions.", "As such, we've recently begun to roll out additional attribution capabilities. In Q3, we began a small alpha of Snap Pixel, our conversion SDK, with a handful of advertisers. Snap Pixel allows advertisers of all sizes to track the impact that Snap Ads have on online sales, lead generation, or other conversion actions in real-time. This is particularly important for the mid-market and SMB advertisers. Additionally, the Pixel will soon support the targeting of custom audiences based on on-site behavior and bidding based on conversions, not just impressions or swipes.", "One of our first advertisers to test Snap Pixel was TechStyle, the parent company to Fabletics, JustFab and ShoeDazzle. They focused on two KPIs, cost per sign up and cost per purchase. It's early, but the results are promising. Across all their brands, they saw a cost per purchase that was about 40% to 60% lower than their goal within 24 hours after someone saw their ad. The retailers also achieved a cost per sign up that was roughly 30% to 50% lower than their goal. They were able to attribute 28% more conversions from their Snapchat ads by looking at one day's worth of view-through attribution.", "The third area of focus is democratizing our Sponsored Creative Tools. Over 60% of our daily active users create Snaps with our camera every day. Sponsored Creative Tools, which includes Lenses and Filters, allow advertisers to leverage this unique creativity to reach their audiences. Until recently, our Sponsored Lens product has been accessible primarily to larger advertisers looking to maximize reach. Based on comScore Xmedia, the average audience of the top primetime shows is between 5 million to 12 million viewers.", "A National Lens on Snapchat can reach well over 20 million users in one day. Because the user experience remains our top priority, we have limited Sponsored Lenses at one per day. This was the right decision as we refined the ad product, but it also impacted our ability to scale. We addressed this in the second quarter with the launch of Audience Lenses. Audience Lenses enable advertisers to purchase Sponsored Lenses that reach specific audiences, at a better entry price point. Advertisers can use the same targeting capabilities that they already use for Snap Ads, including age, gender, geography, and custom audiences. We're confident that this will help reduce seasonality and globalize our creative tools business. In fact, the number of lenses sold in Q3 was up nearly 15% from the last quarter and more than double the amount sold in Q3 of last year.", "Let's look at an example. Adidas wanted to target high school and college athletes for their \"Here to Create\" campaign. They used custom audiences to reach this particular demo and now with Audience Lenses, we're able to do this across all of our products. This allowed them to amplify their message to the most relevant audience, and results were fantastic. They saw an 18% increase in new visitation to their retail stores. We recognize the areas we need to invest in and we are acting quickly. Much of the work that we've done this year is laying the groundwork for 2018 and beyond, but we are encouraged by what we have seen so far.", "Thank you everyone for the time, and now I'll pass it to Drew to discuss our financial highlights for the quarter.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. Snap continues to make solid progress against its long-term goals, and the growing traction across many areas of our business is encouraging. Let me speak to the third quarter highlights.", "First, both Snap Ads and Creative Tools remain a strong one-two combination. Revenue from both product lines increased sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw more growth in engagement in the quarter. Metrics such as time on the app, video views and frequency of use all grew in Q3. We made meaningful progress building out our auction platform. Numerically, over 80% of Snap Ad impressions were delivered via the auction, up from 60% in Q2.", "Overall, Snap Ad impressions grew substantially. Snap Ad impressions increased over 60% sequentially and over 400% year-over-year. This means that we were able to grow ad impressions and engagement simultaneously, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of our business. As Imran mentioned, the auction transition continued to impact Snap Ad pricing in the quarter. In Q3, Snap ad pricing was down more than 20% sequentially and over 60% year-over-year, most of which was driven by the mix shift from reserved inventory at rate card prices to the unreserved auction.", "On a positive note, we were able to partially offset pricing declines with auction contestation. During Q3, we saw that auctions with multiple bidders resulted in prices that were over 40% higher than uncontested auctions. Furthermore, prices for ads that were contested grew sequentially in the quarter.", "On the cost side, our gross margins continue to scale well. We are seeing clear leverage in hosting and revenue share expenses, which is driving continued gross margin expansion. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Gross margins grew to 21%, up 230 basis points sequentially and over 2,000 basis points versus a year ago. Hosting costs per user have risen from $0.64 a year ago to $0.68 in the quarter, only a 7% increase over the last 12 months. We have seen revenues and engagement grow at much faster rates, creating cost leverage. We have excellent traction on some of our hosting cost initiatives and are benefitting from the dual cloud hosting environment.", "Similarly, as expected, we continued to see leverage on partner rev share expenses, driven primarily by monetizing My Story. Revenue share expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 10%, down 300 basis points sequentially and 500 basis points year-over-year. Geographically, North America remains a leading region for ARPU and gross margins. In the third quarter, North American ARPU was $2.17, which is 7 times higher than the rest-of-the-world, but is still well below our peer set. Periodically, we analyze our hosting costs by region, which considers factors such as regional differences in app usage and varied regional hosting rates. This internal analysis estimated that our North American gross margin was already over 50% in Q3.", "Switching gears, operating expenses were thoughtfully managed. In the quarter, costs decreased 2% sequentially to $223.1 million. We continue to manage back of house expenses closely, and corporate G&A fell $8 million, driven by lower employee expenses and reduced legal costs. We also benefitted from the timing of certain expenses including lower trade show costs. The annualized cost per employee was slightly over $300,000 which compares favorably to our peer set. This is down versus prior periods.", "Let me provide a brief update on a few of the investments Snap has made. One of Snap's biggest investments has been in our team. We have over invested early to achieve the scale necessary to compete globally. At the end of Q3, we had nearly 3,000 employees, 80% of which are in the front of house. In the quarter, we added almost 250 people organically, consistent with our expectations. Additionally, we added nearly 100 people with the Placed acquisition.", "Capital investments in the quarter were modest again at $26 million. Total CapeEx per user was what we believe to be an industry leading $0.15. For M&A investments, we completed the Placed acquisition in the quarter, which is off to a good start. Total consideration was $139.6 million. Unfortunately, we misjudged strong early demand for Spectacles and purchased more inventory than we now anticipate being able to sell. As a result, we recorded a $39.9 million non-recurring expense primarily related to excess inventory and purchase commitment cancellations. Moving forward, we will continue to be in the market place with Spectacles and expect modest revenue from the product line.", "We remain in a strong cash position, and ended Q3 with $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Capital deployment priorities remain business operations first, followed by opportunistic M&A. Since the IPO, we have been net settling employee shares for tax purposes. In Q3, we used $162 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Moving forward, we are planning a transition to sell shares on the open market on behalf of employees for tax purposes. As of September 30, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1,202 million and 1,441 million on a fully diluted basis.", "As we move forward, we want to share thoughts on the short-term. We will continue to scale the auction business. We plan to continue the transition of reserved impressions to the auction, and we exited the third quarter with higher than the Q3 average of 80% flowing through our auction platform. As a result, we are planning to see similar auction dynamics to Q3; specifically, gains in impressions and lower prices. We look forward to completing the transition of our Snap Ad business to the self-service and auction platform.", "On hosting expenses, we ended the quarter with slightly higher costs per user than the quarter average of $0.68. Historically, we have seen hosting costs increase during the fourth quarter due to the higher usage over the holiday season. We have seen a similar trend in operating expenses. Historically, our operating costs per head have increased low double digits from Q3 to Q4. As the team continues to settle in, we expect gains in employee productivity to be meaningful. This should allow us to reduce the scope and pace of hiring. Priorities for hiring will continue to be in engineering and international functions. Given this, we expect the pace of hiring to slow in the short-term, particularly in the seasonally slow fourth quarter.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q3 expense was $225.6 million. In the short term, we believe this is a good proxy for future quarters. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator who will open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "That concludes the prepared remarks for today's earnings call and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Imran in order for the auctions to continue to be highly contested it seems like you have to give advertisers ongoing reasons to pay more because that is presumably more highly targeted and has higher ROI. So sounds like you are just starting to ramp up attribution tools. So anyway to characterize, what percentage of your typical advertiser's budgets are being spent on more highly targeted basis? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think a couple of things need to happen for auction density to grow. First off is onboarding lot more advertisers and I think remember we launched our self-service platform in Q2 and we are pretty excited with the progress we made. We talked about it, we saw albeit increased the number of advertisers on our platform and we continue to invest heavily on inside sales team reaching out to small marketers and onboarding them to more and more advertisers on the platform. At the same time in terms of targeting, we actually made pretty significant investments over the last 12 months to help people reach the right -- show the right ad to the right audience, because when we show the right ad to the right audience it actually attracts more significant value for our users, for more advertisers and I think we made pretty good progress on that. On the first query attributions side, Pixel is out. I think we are going to continue to push it forward and I think that will drive advertisers to even more visibility in terms of what kind of ROI they have generated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, this is [indiscernible] for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of your programmatic advertising business, what are your views on opening up the Snap platform to third-party [DSPs] or exchanges to add incremental demand? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think right now we think the best way to drive our business to have the self-service platform where advertisers can reach directly rather than the DSP. We have an incredible audience base and we are very, very excited that audience and understanding about the audience, I think when you open up the DSP platform and things like that there is always a risk that information leakage out of your platform and that's not optimal. So I think we like our strategy of having self-service platform where our advertisers and agencies can come and reach the audience they want to reach and delivering the most right ad to the right person.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks. One for Imran and Drew and I guess one for Evan if I can. First, you guys talked about the pricing declines with the shift to programmatic as a headwind to revenue which seems obvious on a pricing impact. But are you really seeing budget pressure from this and specifically can you talk about what clients generally do with budgets when they shift to programmatic? Are they buying a consistent volume of impressions and tweaking budgets or just re-investing to get more volume such that it isn't really that much of a headwind to revenue? Any color you can share there would be great. And then a strategic one for Evan; seems like a lot of changes focusing on user growth, focusing on the creator communities. So just wondering, you know, if you can elaborate a bit how you guys had come around and how you get comfortable really as [this month] disrupt the [close friend] engagement that you guys have historically been so focused on?", "Imran Khan", "I think in terms of our advertiser adoptions, you have seen that roughly 400% growth in ad impressions on our platform on a year-over-year basis. So we are very pleased with the number of ad impression growing on our platform. And I think as Evan pointed out in his quick dispatch the significant impression growth we saw engagement on our platform grow on a year-over-year basis. I think one of the key thing also is self-service, allowing us to do is bringing a lot more advertisers on our user advertising platform. We really didn't get big dollar from the direct response advertiser, or performance marketers and lot of mix site advertisers. And by opening up the self-service platform we are bringing them on the platform. I want to share an example of our small advertisers who are not a bit necessarily are performance advertisers would not be successful on our platform if it was [indiscernible]. So GOAT, which is an online marketplace for buying and selling sneakers on mobile, they used our platform to drive app install and they were able to drive LTV, life time value, 20% above their goal and improved product period by a month compared to other marketing channels. So this is a type of example that by opening up the platform we were able to access advertisers who would not be there in the past successful on our platform and they can spend more money and drive their goals.", "Evan Spiegel", "You are right to point out that this communication between close friend is really valuable to our business and it remains the most important thing for Snap. So I think the really exciting thing about the redesign coming is that we have found a way to preserve and I think in many ways enhanced that friend communication while still providing more opportunities to provide distribution and monetization opportunities to contact vendors. And so I think you wish we were [inside] the roll out, but you are right that our focus here really is preserving that frequency and intimacy of communication between close friends.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler", "Hi, guys. Two questions. As in first on the user base, you called out that September was a big month for Android, added more net adds than iOS. So do you expect this to potentially accelerate going forward? And you talked about how you are working to simplify the app, is that happening right now or is that something that could happen in the future? And then Imran, on the self-serve platform, can you just talk about the behavior that some of these new advertisers were signing up in self-serve for the first time, what is the behavior? Are they ramping up their spend each week? Are they coming in and spending and then dropping off? Just any general color on the behavior of self-serve that will be great. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So given the distribution of Android devices in the world I would expect that over time we will see more net adds coming from Android which is why we focus so much on improving the Android experience and why we are re-building the Android application from the ground up to -- to make it easier to use. And right now, we are using a new version of the application internally and having a lot of fun with it, so excited to roll that out.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think Ross, with regards to your question, previously before the self-service platform if an advertiser wants to buy an advertisement they had to commit a significant chunk of dollars, in many cases couple of hundred thousand dollars and that's really difficult for many, many advertisers to come invest on a -- right on the new platform. With the self-service we saw that many advertisers are coming in on our platform and they are testing and as they are seeing success they are increasing their budget. I think one of the key thing we have seen that our performance advertising dollar or [DR] dollar has grown significantly. Also I talked about in the call that revenue from our small and medium sized businesses has tripled. So we are seeing great traction with that as more advertisers are coming and testing and learning and invest more.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead.", "Brian White", "Yeah. Evan you mentioned they are the priority in 2018 and I'm wondering you put a pretty cool world lens out there, Stranger Things with Netflix and I'm wondering how that innovation was received? And also how you are thinking about leveraging the True Depth Camera system on the iPhone X. I know Craig Federighi did a demonstration at the Apple event of September 12th, and did he shout out for Snap? So if you could just expand on that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. Thanks, Brian. You know I wish I had more data for you around the Stranger Things launch, because I agree that was super cool. I am more excited to see more and more advertisers experimenting with those products. I think they are creating really unique experiences for communities. So that's a win-win for us when our community really loves something that an advertiser is creating and spending a lot of time interacting with it. And as for the Apple innovation, very exciting to see, I think early days for Apple and their investments around AR. But the True Depth Camera obviously is ready for Snap and for the special -- on the front facing camera those lenses I think are enhanced by that building block that they provide.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "John Blackledge", "Thanks. Two questions, on the app redesign. If you can give us a sense of the timing, any more insight into the changes and why you think the redesign could be disruptive in the near term? And then on the user side distribution the redesign and the new Android app, how should we think about user growth in the near term?", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't have any timing to share with you today. So we will I guess look forward to surprising you with the redesign. But I think conceptually we have been spending a lot of our time sort of studying the evolution of content feeds on mobile and so if we kind of go back to the beginning of content feeds, Twitter was really the first content feed on mobile and it was interest based. So you would follow things you were interested in or news organization or celebrities and obviously the next evolution in that content feed. I would say for us invention of content feed based on content created by your friends and this was a very interesting innovation because it obviously personalized the content feed based on what your friends thought you would be interested in. and I think there is a really exciting opportunity here for another evolution about that content feed that addresses some of the short comings of the friend based content feed model. So for example on a friend based content feed, in order to get more content in that feed you need more friends and when people start adding more friends they then see a lot less comfortable posting content and so they start posting less. And that means that you need even more friends to get more content. And so you end up in this kind of precarious situation where because you based the content feed on what friends are posting you are sort of inherently limited in how you grow that collection of content. And ultimately what we found is that the best predictor of what people are interested in and want to watch is actually what they are watching, right. And I think there's an opportunity here for us to create a really great personalized content service that doesn't at all diminish the grades and I think very differentiated communications business that we have established.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Hello, Justin your line is live, you may proceed with your question.", "Justin Post", "Sorry about that, I was on mute. My question is really the mix of time on the site. Clearly Snaps are up 40%, any change in that mix? And then could you talk a little bit about the monetization of Snaps, how that compares versus many of the discovered kind of stories, how do you think about that? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So we don't break out the mix of time on the service. Overall time spent has been growing which is something that we are really excited about and so hopefully can share more with you in the future around that. I think it is a great opportunity to talk a little bit about our creative tools, like we talked about earlier around lenses, because those are a really fantastic way that we monetize our communication service. And so not only are we able to monetize the consumption side of the business around stories but also our creative tools like Geofilters and Lenses that has proven to be an expected way as Imran shared to drive much traction around our communications products.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think one of the key things to point out on Lenses and filters, I talked about in the call how we saw that because of audience in those lenses we saw 15% growth in the number of lenses sold on our platform in Q3 and doubled year-over-year. The other thing is these are very interesting product and completely differentiated product, for a longest period of time advertisers are trying to figure out how can they be part of the consumer conversations without being intrusive. Out lenses product and filters product actually give the advertisers the ability to be a part of the consumer conversation and in a very premium fashion. The other interesting thing is that the amount of time people are playing with those lenses product is actually pretty significant. In a world in mobile where the attention span is significantly lower, the play time on our lenses are actually very, very exciting to many, many advertisers and that's also driving the adoption. So I think we are actually very, very excited about both of our products [indiscernible] and our creative tools and we are using that as an opportunity to monetize those products long term.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks for taking my question. I wanted on advertising kind of a high level picture on the ad format. Ad performance really matters to driving ad budgets, you are talking about a redesign of the app. How do you think about the potential risk that a minute spent in stories format is just going to monetize materially lower than other social interaction like a news feed. Is that a risk because the way people consume stories and you are able to monetize that as high as other formats and if that's the case, should you be having news feed?", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't think we would add a news feed per se, but I definitely think there are ways to improve that performance on our service and we are always looking at evaluating that and as part of the redesign I do think there will be new monetization opportunities. Again too early to tell there, but we are excited about that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to hit on two things. First, you talked about the DAU trajectories through the 3Q and it kind of ended stronger in September. Just curious on those lines what you can tell us about Maps and how that's doing, didn't seem to get as much commentary tonight as it did three months ago? And then, secondly, just how that DAU trajectory is kind of early in 4Q? And then just on the advertiser side, could you help us understand when an advertiser would use the direct sales force going forward versus the auction format? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Just on Maps, we are very excited about how that product is progressing, we continue to really invest in this action emoji concept, which is very cool, because it allows people to express themselves without creating a snap. So as we look to empower self expression and remove the friction from self-expression sometimes people in the moment they don't necessarily want to create a snap and the Maps allows them to show that for example they are on a bike and listening to music [indiscernible] interactive around that behavior. So as far as the Maps is concerned very excited about it but still hidden behind a pinch dresser and we look forward to elevating the Maps in our product so that more people can find it easily. Obviously we are not going to provide guidance on DAU, but I think it is important to note, our audience may not be the largest today but we certainly feel that it's the most strategic. And very excited about the 70%, 13 to 34-year olds that we reach in the U.S., the U.K., France and Australia and I think that that is a really strong base to grow from because it's very easy to monetize and we will be able to fund our future growth in countries that maybe are harder to monetize in the short-term but that we believe will monetize in the longer term. So as I mentioned today, we are taking steps to change our product, and change our approach to grow outside of those key markets where we do think that there are future monetization opportunities. What we really want to make sure is that given the strategic nature of the 13 to 34 audience that was not yet -- that was really engaged with the Snap platform before we extended beyond our core.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think with regards to direct sales force versus auction, I think it's really important to understand that auction is a buying mechanism that lets our advertisers to come in and buy, test and learn either way their campaigns and see what drives better results. The value of our sales force remain incredibly high, primarily with the auction because the advertisers need to understand our platform and having insight what was on our platform, how to read on Snapchat, those kind of values that our sales force provide to our clients. So what we are saying is that as we make our buying platform more and more automotive, our sales force transition from taking orders to become more of a consultant for our clients to become partners. So that frees their time and they can focus more and more time solving client's business problem, because when you solve the client's business problem that drives really success. So I will share one quick example. So for example Activation, they wanted to test [shortfall] of ads on our platform, so it included this price in Snaps on our platform to work with our sales force and for their Call of Duty World War II title. And that was a 5 second cinemagraph ad, they worked with our creative strategy team and that drove 19 points lift in brand awareness, because our sales force had more time to work with the clients and give more insight and that really drove us to [indiscernible]. So I think that that's one of the -- another part example. So I think direct sales force has become enabler and become a consultant for our clients.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield", "My guess is from a really high level. It seems like you have only been public for you know eight or nine months, it seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time. I mean the auction seems to have surprised you, changing the apps making it easier for users. You are embracing [influencers]. Just when you look at the short period of time since the IPO where you seemed to be pretty upbeat, what's happened so fast -- what led to such a significant shift? And I guess maybe attached to that, is I guess for [every month], in the senior team you have assembled, not just on the call, but overall, is your senior team, the team really being a much bigger team or differently? And then just a housekeeping question on Spectacles, I think [indiscernible] comments about Spectacles were exceeding their expectation, yet today you are writing them off like three months of inventory. Just wondering, how you square exceeding expectations with the write-off will be helpful? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Rich. There has been a ton in change in a very short period of time and that's been the case over the life of the business in the last six years we have been in business. We continue to evolve the product very rapidly. We continue to evolve the business very rapidly and I guess we are just not afraid to make changes in the long term interest of the business. So I would expect that we continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interests of growing the user base for revenue and ultimately providing our customers with a great product experience. As it relates to team dynamics, I am very happy with our executive team, but I am constantly evaluating our team, providing feedback and we are all working together to grow and trying to run the business in a productive way as possible. As it comes to Spectacles, you are right, we were very excited about Spectacles by the initial reception, because we were so excited we made I guess the wrong decision and we were balancing the trade off with [unit] economics of course that come with hardware. But ultimately we made the wrong decision based on the early traction and ordered a lot of long lead time products and ultimately we weren't able to sell as many Spectacles as we thought we had be able to based on our early adoption. So we are learning from it and we are kind of avoiding a similar mistake in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Jason Helfstein", "First, just about the brand advertisers, can you talk about how the annual budget cycle plays into it? It seems more and more budgets are being based on a calendar basis versus in the old days it was more of kind of on the school calendar. And kind of where you were at the beginning of this year, perhaps not in a position with measurements, some of the things that advertisers are demanding and kind of how that perhaps handicapped you this year but then how you stand going into next year as those budget decisions are being made? And then also how do you derisk the redesign of the apps and we know that your younger users are quite sensitive to the app that was originally designed for them? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think in terms of advertisers' upfront deals and things like that, look I think, one of the key thing is to drive more upfront deals, we have to drive value for our advertisers and as our business is growing we are able to show more and more value. We are able to show more and more products, more and more measurements, more and more targeting and also we are going to cover them for a long term. Usually I think one of the biggest complaints I heard from a lot of our agency customers, that hey, we don't hear from your team more often, because we didn't have a big team. Now I think the investment we made on the headcount helps us to cover them, to look at them and help them to really show what success could look like on Snapchat and how to win on Snapchat. And I think that's driving and we are having more and more conversation about upfront and I think having much more deeper conversation with the agencies on what we can do together. So I think we are making good progress. I am pretty pleased with it. And on top of that we are onboarding a lot more new advertisers we couldn't reach on our reserve platform, because now it's opened up the opportunity to reach out to the performance advertisers and small and medium sized businesses.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as it pertains to the redesign again we don't know exactly how that's going to play out, but we will be testing the product both internally, which is ongoing and externally and I think we are going to learn a lot from that. But fundamentally as we look at the product evolution at Snap, we really try to build products around the pieces and sometimes that means that there is an strong related option for a product. Like for example, our iconic storage products basically had no known use for the first six months or so. And so I think over time we have learned not to be fearful of making big product changes that we think are in the best interest of our community and we are going to keep going.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Thanks and I apologize if it's already been asked. But trying to get a better handle on the impact that the growing auction based ad platform is having and will have on financials that we all see every quarter. Can you give us a general sense of the difference in the prices in that market today relative to your direct sold business? And also what portion of the overall revenue is generated from it? And obviously since you are trying to get to -- where are we -- in this transitional period as it relates to the trade-off between pricing pressure and in growing your advertiser base? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks for the question. So at a high level, the auction is a strategic move for the company. It's something that's important for our business as we move forward and we think it's the right way for us to be growing long-term and regarding our reach. The dynamics that we saw in the third quarter with the auction are consistent with what we saw in the second quarter and that is growth in revenue on the auctions platform driven by significant increases in impressions. So we saw impressions up 400% year-over-year and up over 60% sequentially. So that impression growth is real. On the flip side we did see that we moved from sort of a rate card pricing model to an auction-based model, we did see pressure in pricing. Sequentially prices were down 20% of the quarter and 60% year-over-year. So that was real. We did see -- well we see contestation and we see bidders -- multiple bidders for that same advertising space we get the prices that were 40% higher than places where we didn't have a contested auction. So that really bodes well for the future. Obviously one of our key strategies here is to really grow the competition within the auction and then have more advertisers using the platform that does bode well for where we are. So that's the auction platform, it's really the centerpiece of our Snap Ad business as migrate there. We were -- 60% of our ads were sold on that platform in the second quarter, it's now over 80% and as I talked about our commentary in the fourth-quarter it's going to be important as that transition continues. As we plan our business we are thinking about that transition continuing and we continue to see a bump in -- we are continuing to see a bump in impressions and there is continued pressure on pricing. So that's Snap to Snap Ads that is at a high-level. We also have that good one-two punch with creative tools, the create tool business is a good business for us and we made progress there as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks. I have one for Drew and one for Evan. Following the answer to Mark's question can you draw down a bit on your high level view of the auction? Can you give [indiscernible] the rule of 80-20, so if 80% of the impressions were sold [dramatically], was it equal to in terms of advertising revenues as opposed to [indiscernible] revenues?", "Drew Vollero", "So at a high level the auction is a growing piece of our business. We haven't broken out the differences between Snap Ads and creative tools. I think we have talked about a good solid one-two punch, so both of them are important pieces of revenue. So that based on that you can get to like where you need to get to. If the majority of Snap Ads business right now is sold through the auction, more than 80% from an impression base, yeah its [sold] there. So it's an important and growing piece of our business, but in terms of quantifying the actual amount we are not going to do that.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Youssef Squali", "Thank you. Two questions, one for Imran and maybe one for Evan. Imran remind us again that for the budget timing of the launch of the programmatic platform was it Q4 of last year? Just trying to figure out exactly when do we lap that launch and when do we start having that maybe stop being a headwind. And then Evan you launched Context web -- I am sorry, Context Cards last quarter, can you speak to early learnings there and how this may help you leverage partners to provide users with more information and especially ability to trend that? Maybe if you can address that that will be great. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you for the questions. So with regards to timing, our API was the first partnership -- was the first initiative to start the business programmatically. That was launched in October of last year and then we expanded our API partnership in Q1 and then in late Q2 we launched our self-service platform. To give you a better sense as you are trying to understand the impact of our -- of this auction business over time, in my prepared remarks I talked about it that how auction volume for Snap Ads business as a percentage of overall Snap Ads business was over 80% and that is up 3x from Q1 and up from 60% in Q2, just to give you some sense.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. And as it pertains to Context Cards, very [solid] about it, initially Context Cards are focused on places and I think one of the coolest parts about Context Cards is that they leverage the behavior that's certainly known across our ecosystem where people swipe up on things that they are interested in to take an action, whether that's an ad or content posted by their friends or content that they see in Maps. And so we are leveraging this sort of [one] behavior swiping up to get more and obviously today it's only really around places, but we are very close to expand that to learning more about all sorts of things and something we are going to continue to listen.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. We thank you for attending today's session and you may now disconnect."]}

During the first quarter, we focused our efforts primarily on the performance and quality of our Snapchat application and automation across our content products and advertising business. We're pleased with the early results from these performance and quality improvements, particularly on Android devices. These improvements helped drive a significant increase in engagement, with now over 3 billion Snaps created every day with our cameras, generating an increase in overall sessions and time spent.", "We were also able to more than double the number of net additional users coming from Android devices compared to last quarter. And Android users accounted for over 30% of net additional users this quarter, up from 20% last quarter. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're excited by the amount of progress we've made in such a short time.", "We averaged 166 million daily active users for the quarter. Worldwide net additional users in Q1 increased by 54% compared to Q4 as we continued to expand our community in North America and Europe. We also managed to make some headway in the rest of world, largely due to improvements on Android.", "Towards the end of the first quarter, we began to roll out our search product. Search is exciting for us because it begins to expose the so-called long tail of content on our service. With so many Snaps created every day, there really is a story for everything on Snapchat. Search surfaces interesting Stories created by machine learning and allows our community to find Stories for anything they might be interested in.", "We made significant progress in automating our advertising business this quarter, with more than 20% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically through our API. Automating our ads platform means that advertisers get better pricing, our community sees better ads and we're able to make more money per impression.", "Overall, I feel we have executed well on our priorities for this quarter, performance, quality and automation. Our progress this quarter should provide a strong foundation as we continue to build our business.", "With that, I will turn it over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We're very pleased with our Q1 achievements. We're really excited about the progress we have made increasing engagement across Snapchat. We believe that great advertising starts with strong user engagement. As Evan mentioned, time spent for our users continues to grow. On average, in Q1 our users spent over 30 minutes per day on Snapchat. This increase is largely because of the unique content on our platform.", "Snapchat offers exclusive content from several perspectives, friends and family, our global community and premium publishers. With user Stories, Snapchatters see the world through the eyes of their friends and family. Our community creates and sends billions of Snaps every day as a fun and easy way to communicate and stay up to date with their closest friends.", "With our Stories, Snapchatters stay informed and connected to the world around them.

Our platform allows us to engage an audience that research shows is difficult to reach. We believe that the ability to deliver this type of reach and engagement is the cornerstone of a great advertising business.", "Now I would like to share some of the progress we have made to benefit advertisers in three key areas, one, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and, three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. We started our advertising business by servicing big brands. This strategy proved invaluable. These partners have high standards and provided great feedback that shaped our priorities. Universal Pictures was our first advertiser in the fall of 2014. Since then, they have challenged us to find unique and effective ways to reach the right audience for each campaign. We have been a go-to partner for nearly every single title, helping them across a variety of objectives. From 2015 to 2016, Universal more than doubled their spend with us which we feel is a testament to the returns they have seen on their early investment.", "And we continue to listen and develop new solutions to serve our advertisers. By listening to our partners, we learned that advertisers are hungry for more effective direct response advertising solutions. This meant enhancing our Snap Ad brand's experience with interactive capabilities which we call Snap Ads with Attachments. Attachments help advertisers accomplish specific goals by providing a way for users to engage with a Snap Ad.", "For example, a user who watches a Snap Ad for a new Hollywood movie can swipe up to view the full trailer or buy a ticket, all without leaving Snapchat. I would like to share a couple of examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments are driving value for our performance advertisers.", "Acorns, a micro investing app, partnered with us on an app install campaign to drive both brand awareness and app installs. With this campaign we delivered a 300% increase in app installs. Fullscreen also continues to partner with us on various direct response initiatives. They consistently see higher active viewing rates from users who come in via Snap Ads compared to other platforms. And each time we collaborate together, they continue to see lower costs per acquisition.", "We have designed our ad products to work well on their own or when used together in integrated campaigns. We have many advertisers that now leverage Snapchat with an always-on strategy.", "Throughout Q1, Snapchat was a strategic mobile partner to Anheuser-Busch's core brands, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra and Busch. Anheuser-Busch leveraged Snapchat as an always-on video partner, utilizing all of our ad products for a variety of initiatives. This included sports partnership like NFL, MLB and NASCAR, as well as holidays and tent-poles, like St. Patrick's Day.", "L'Oreal U.S.A is another great example. They have made us an always-on part of their strategy, augmenting Lens and Geofilter executions with Snap Ads. L'Oreal U.S.A has taken advantage of Snapchat's premium, contextually relevant publisher content in combination with advanced targeting in user Stories, to keep their brands top of mind with customers.", "The second area we have focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We want to make it easy and painless for both the largest brands and the smallest local businesses to advertise on Snapchat. This includes how advertisers buy, create and manage their ads. We're still in the early stages of building these tools and we're making good progress.", "In Q1 2016, we launched our on-demand Geofilters tool or ODG. To date we have tens of thousands of advertisers creating and managing their own geofiltered campaigns. This past quarter, we launched line of credit for ODG to make it even easier for all advertisers to buy ads.", "Our most significant step was with the launch of our API and auction in Q4 of last year. We have been working hard to scale our auction to make it something valuable to advertisers of all sizes. Today, our API is live in 24 countries and serving some of the world's largest brands in addition to small and medium-sized businesses.", "Last week we announced our first Snap Ads self-service product, called Snapchat Ad Manager. Our goal is to put the power of our ad products into the hands of every advertiser, regardless of their size. This tool supports all of our ad products, targeting capabilities; and goal-based auction solutions which allows advertisers to bid for swipes or bid for app installs.", "The third area of focus is proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Delivering metrics and proving ROI to advertisers has been a massive area of progress over the past 12 months. Today we have 13 different third-party measurement partners and this list will continue to grow. We also invested heavily in Snap to Store, our own first-of-its-kind measurement offering. Snap to Store allows advertisers to measure foot traffic and demographics for Snapchatters after they see ads on our platform. These kind of location-based online to off-line measurement is a strength for Snapchat and in many ways a Holy Grail of ad measurement.", "During the 2016 holiday season, Hollister ran a Snap Ads campaign. And within seven days of seeing the ad, Snap to Store found that over 63,000 incremental Snapchatters visited a Hollister store nationally.", "Overall, we're excited about the progress we have made as we scale our advertising business. We have a lot of work to do in the rest of 2017 and look for -- to what's ahead.", "Thanks, everyone, for the time. And now I will hand it over to Drew.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Growth in new users, engagement and year-over-year revenues highlighted our first quarter results. Revenues grew 286% year-over-year to $149.6 million, driven primarily by strong advertiser demand. Revenues in North America were $128.7 million in the first quarter, up 259% year-over-year. In Europe, revenues were $13.1 million, up 385% year-over-year. Rest of world revenues were $7.8 million, up from only a couple hundred thousand dollars, a year ago.", "Sequentially, first quarter revenues were down 10% compared to Q4 2016. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the expected seasonality from advertising which comprises the bulk of our revenues.", "Snap sold revenue was $129 million, approximately 86% of total revenues. Partner sold revenue was $12.3 million and other revenues were $8.3 million, primarily driven by Spectacles. Total revenues outside North America for Q1 were 14% of sales, up from 7% of sales, a year ago. Average revenue per user or ARPU, was $0.90 in the first quarter, up from $0.32 a year ago but sequentially lower than Q4.", "We believe North America remains a leading indicator for the scale potential of our business. North American ARPU was $1.81, more than double our global average which was up 170% versus last year. Both Snap Ads and Creative Tools were meaningful revenue drivers for the business. New products like the API were also key revenue drivers in Q1.", "Now turning to expenses, we have two primary cost components, cost of revenue and operating expenses. Please note that when I discuss these expense figures, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of hosting costs and revenue share expenses. Operating expenses are driven by headcount costs. We utilize third parties to provide our infrastructure. This strategy has allowed us to focus on product innovation while we leverage their expertise, their capital and their operating efficiencies. We estimate this capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures to date, while delivering competitive daily costs to serve our users.", "In the quarter, we made good progress against our hosting costs in two key areas. First, we started to migrate to a dual cloud environment using both Google and Amazon to host our infrastructure. And second, we signed new contracts with each provider which lowered costs for most of our key services. As such, hosting expenses fell 12% in the quarter sequentially, down from $113 million to $99 million. These savings more than offset the increases we incurred from growing engagement.", "Relatedly, total cost of revenue fell sequentially $10.3 million or 6%, driven by those hosting savings, partially offset by revenue share expenses which grew slightly. Revenue share expenses increased by shifting the structure of certain revenue share contracts from variable to fixed fee arrangements which raised costs in the quarter but could create leverage as the year progresses and as revenues expand.", "As mentioned, cost of revenue is closely linked to our capital expenditures. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $18 million and were primarily spent on the expansion of our global office footprint. Capital expenditures were $20.4 million in Q4 2016, so Q1 expenses were down 12% sequentially.", "Operating expenses increased 18% sequentially to $196.2 million in the first quarter. We continue to invest in acquiring engineering talent and scaling our global operations. Expenses related to headcount were over 75% of total operating expenses in the quarter. We ended the quarter with 2,360 employees, up from 1,859 at the end of 2016.", "Our financial strategies for operating expenses are threefold, first, to continue to invest in engineering and sales; second, to leverage G&A expenses; and, third, to moderate overall cost growth per head. In the quarter, we made progress against all three goals. 90% of our new hires were in engineering and sales. Additionally, G&A expenses fell from 39% to 32% of total operating expenses. And third, operating expenses per head declined 7% sequentially. Our overall business remains in investment mode.", "Scale operations related to recruiting and facilities are incurred upfront while monetization occurs more gradually. As such, nominal losses increased in the quarter.", "GAAP net loss was $2.2 billion for the quarter which included the expected stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $2 billion as a result of our IPO. Stock-based compensation expense was significantly higher than prior periods due to two factors. First, the recognition of expenses related to RSUs for which the performance condition was triggered by the completion of our IPO in March. And second, an award granted to our CEO which we expensed in its entirety during the quarter.", "Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2017 RSUs at the end of Q1 is $1.3 billion, expected to be recognized over a period of slightly more than three years, of which about half of that expense we expect to recognize during the remainder of 2017. RSUs granted during 2017 will be an additional expense.", "Adjusted EBITDA loss was $188.2 million in Q1 2017, compared to a loss of $152.3 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $93.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total shares outstanding at the end of Q1 was 1,179 million and 1,432 million on a fully diluted basis.", "We remain in a strong cash position. Cash and marketable securities increased sequentially from $987.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily from the proceeds of our IPO in early March. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Product innovation and execution remain top priorities for 2017.", "I'll now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.", "Mark Mahaney", "Two sets of questions. Drew, would you care to comment at all about how to think about DAU growth near term through the balance of the year? And any commentary on when we could see peak EBITDA losses?", "And then, Evan, if you think about the product roadmap, are there particular areas you think that we as investors should focus on? I know you mentioned a couple of improvements you made to the Android platform. Other -- on the Apple side, are there particular new features that have been rolled out recently or are about to be rolled out that you think could be meaningful in terms of user and engagement growth? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. I'd love to speak a little bit to the DAU question, because it's a question that we get all the time. And I think one of the reasons why it's such a popular question is because there's a lot of this thing in our industry called growth hacking, where you send a lot of push notifications to users or you try to get them to do things that might be unnatural or something like that.", "And I think while that's the easy way to grow daily actives quickly, we don't think that those sorts of techniques are very sustainable over the long term. And I think that can ultimately impact our relationship with the customer.", "And so I can give an example where if we had just in the beginning encouraged Snapchatters to add all their friends in the contact book instead of just a few of them, they might feel really uncomfortable creating Snaps and adding them to their Story, because they wouldn't know who was actually watching.", "So, ultimately, I think the way that we try to help people understand how we think about daily active user growth is really through the lens of creativity and creation, because we built our entire business on creation.", "So one of the things I think we've talked about a lot is this idea that anytime someone creates a Snap, they typically either send it to their friend which brings that friend into the Snapchat ecosystem; or they add it to their Story which obviously contributes to time spent as they provide that content to all their friends.", "And so, I think the most important thing to understand is that really we think of this daily active user growth as a function or a derivative of the growth in creation. And so we're really excited about the momentum there.", "And then I think we also talked about two things that are really important to the growth of our service. The first is affordable cell service, broadband cell service and decent to high-end smartphones. So historically we've really focused our efforts on markets where both of those are available because we can really deliver value through our products that way. So I think we think, over time, as connectivity grows, that more people will be able to use our products and really get value from them.", "So the last thing I will say is that the way we talk about DAU growth in our Company really as it pertains to creativity is about removing friction from the creative process. So we've talked about Lenses which I think are a great product. And the reason why I think that that prompted such an explosion in creativity is because it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service, because people enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that.", "So another example we gave recently was the improvements to our Android product. And so I think the more we're able to reduce friction from the creative process by improving the way our camera works in terms of Creative Tools and also just functionality, more people will feel empowered to express themselves. And I think we believe that that translates to DAU growth.", "Drew Vollero", "Mark, as it relates to your question on guidance, whether it's DAUs or peak EBITDA losses, we're going to run the Company here for the long term. We want the flexibility to make the right decision in the long term. So we're not going to be short sighted about profit decisions to make a quarter or whatever that would end up being. So at this point, there is not going to be any financial guidance coming from Snap.", "Mark Mahaney", "Thank you, Evan. Thank you, Drew.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Evan, just one follow-up on the DAU and then one for either Imran or Drew. So it sounded like the Android activations are picking up. So I guess the question is, why isn't the rest of world region keeping pace with maybe the historical trend that you've seen in that geo or what you're seeing right now in North America and Europe, with around 3 million added each quarter?", "And then do you expect that to pick up at some point in the future? And any color -- you guys just launched the World Lenses product about a month ago, so any initial read on how that uptake has been going. And that I have one follow-up.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So I think the connectivity issue is a real problem in the developing world, because it really changes the use case of our service and the behavior of people that use Snapchat.", "So, for example, in certain developing world markets, people tend to use their Wi-Fi at home or in an Internet Cafe because the broadband cell service is so expensive. And what that means is that you can't use Snap to communicate in the moment. You have to go use Snap at a wireless Cafe. And that turns Snap into much more of a broadcast, lean back kind of service.", "And so I think we can invest in growing those sorts of products in those markets. But the way that our service works, I think, is by empowering this sort of visual communication. And that is just really tough if you don't have cell service wherever you go.", "Ross Sandler", "Got it, okay. And then the question for Imran or Drew is just on the revenue breakdown. The $150 million, can you just -- Drew, you mentioned that both the Creative Tools and Snap Ads were growing rapidly. Can you just give us a little sense on how much of that came from those two buckets and where we're today on ad load for discover?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think -- look, we built the best mobile ad product. I fundamentally believe that. If you look at our Snap Ad product, they are full screen; they play with sound. And if you look at our sponsored Creative Tools -- those are the Lenses and Filters -- people are actually putting it on their pictures and videos and sharing with their friends. So they are -- that actually has very superior ROI that we have seen with many, many advertisers. And both of those sponsored Creative Tools and our Snap Ads are contributing meaningful revenue. We're not breaking those down at this point.", "With regards to ad load, look, we're very, very early days. If you look at -- as Evan mentioned, we now have more than 3 billion Snaps get created on our platform. I talked about how we have our average users are spending 30 minutes -- more than 30 minutes on our platform. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of ad load.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "I have one for Evan and one for Imran, if I can. Evan, when you think about the creative process behind product development, how much of this focus is really on products for your core audience versus products perhaps for a more mass audience, including older demographics? Maybe you can give us a sense of what you're seeing from those folks in terms of today and what products might be in the pipeline that appeal more to older audiences.", "And then, Imran, wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of adoption around the self-service platform and in particular around direct response versus brand advertisers. Do you see evidence that the mix is increasingly shifting more to the DR side? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of the way we develop product, the important thing to understand is that we're always trying to do our best to build products that are universally appealing. So things like talking with pictures or telling Stories, those are the things that we really believe are universally appealing.", "Although we do tend to market our products directly to younger people because, frankly, they are more interested in learning how to use new technology products. And that's sort of -- is partly inspired by trying to teach my grandma how to use email; and she'd really prefer to just talk on the phone. So I think now a lot of grandparents are using email, but 20 years ago it was a little different.", "And so I think, over time, that strategy has worked for us. This quarter, the 25-plus demo, time spent in sessions are up and it continues to be a larger portion of our audience. So I really do believe we've done a good job delivering products with universal appeal, even if they are initially adopted by people who are excited about new ways to use cameras and communicate.", "Imran Khan", "Yes and with regards to self-service, our journey for self-service started in October of last year when we launched our API. Now we have 24 API partners. And in Q1, 20% of our Snap Ad impressions were served through the API platform. So that is pretty -- we're very pleased with that adoption within six months of launching the product.", "And the self-service, we announced last week that we make it available. We're very excited about the initial reaction and excitement about this product. It will be broadly available first week of June, so I think it's too early to comment about it.", "With regards to DR versus brand, I think we took a deliberate approach to start our business with the brand advertising. And the reason is we've listened -- we heard from our advertisers that there was not enough good solutions for brand advertising on the mobile. And a lot of the brand advertisers are also the very large advertisers and they have very high standards. So I think by proving the ROI to the large brand advertisers, we have been able to create a very good, strong, mobile app product on the marketplace.", "We have been making great progress on the DR side. In the call, I talked about the example of Acorn where they saw a 300% increase; or Fullscreen were testing very healthy customer acquisition costs. We're seeing more and more DR customers adopting our platform and seeing great result.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.", "Eric Sheridan", "Maybe two, both around long term strategy and shorter term, as well, on the hardware side. Evan, would love to get your sense of how you think about hardware that needs to be made by Snap itself versus leveraging, especially areas like AR and VR that we might see from third parties, sort of a follow-up on Mark's question from earlier. And then one around the financials. With the step-down in revenue quarter over quarter, Q1 over Q4, is there any way you could call out the impact that Spectacles might have had in that step-down, quarter over quarter? Thanks, guys.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of our hardware strategy, our approach when we're exploring new technology is to usually work on it ourselves. So if you remember back even when we started building Publisher Stories, we really created a lot of our own content. And that's usually the best way for us to explore something really, really quickly and really learn from it. And so that's been our strategy.", "Today with Spectacles, I think it's been really exciting to see people capture memories from their perspective. There's obviously something really exciting about that. Over, I guess, 5 million Snaps have been created with Spectacles to date. And so I think we're going to keep experimenting there. And then at some point obviously, I think as we've shown with our other products, we like being a good partner and I think that's always an interesting avenue to explore.", "Drew Vollero", "So, financially, Eric, on the Spectacles side again, we launched the Spectacles.com website during the quarter. It's a modest program for us right now. We report that in other revenue. We don't break out Spectacles, per se, but it was a little more than $8 million for the quarter.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "I had two; first one for Imran. Can you just talk about what kind of content you're looking for on the Snap platform and how you ensure that you get the discoverability of that video or content in what's becoming a more crowded discover tab?", "And then second, drew, just understanding that there's seasonality, of course, in 1Q in brand spending. You're also just very early in your trajectory. But is there anything else to think about here as we go through 2017, in terms of seasonal or other kinds of comp issues through the year? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I'd actually love to take this opportunity to talk a little more broadly about our content strategy in general. The simple answer to the discoverability problem for our publishers to date has been really the application of machine learning which has really helped us show the right content to the right person in terms of the Publisher Stories content.", "But I think more broadly, we have really three great types of content on our service. The first obviously, the user Stories product that we initially created where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and they don't feel like they're part of a popularity contest. And I think that product has been really terrific.", "And I think after that, obviously, we developed Publisher Stories. And Publisher Stories I think are really interesting because we were able to really create an ecosystem that works where publishers have an incremental audience where they can monetize their content; but also build a relationship with the customers that are viewing that content that we've seen also impact their business outside of the Snap ecosystem. And that relationship is really, really important to us. And we have a loyalty metric that we share with those partners because I think they've really been able to build a relationship on Snap.", "And then I think the last one that's really fun for us and is really a new one, are the new Stories that are being created in our search product. And that's really exciting because people all over the world are experiencing really fun things. And just by contributing their Snap to Our Story, we do all the hard work on the back end to basically collect all these perspectives together, compile them into interesting Stories that everyone can enjoy. So I think this is yet another type of relationship that's being built on Snap where people around the world are seeing things from new perspectives.", "So, I think, broadly speaking, the content strategy is working well. And then I think we have some other things we're interested in, in building on in the future.", "Drew Vollero", "On the second part of your question, obviously the business is scaling quite rapidly. We were up 286% year-over-year, if you look at the revenues. As you look at the back half of the year, obviously we're building an international business. We have a salesforce now that's really starting to get traction.", "There were a couple of the events in the back half of 2016 from a seasonal perspective. We did have the Olympics in the third quarter of 2016. That was a nice bump for us. And then in the fourth quarter, we have good partnerships with college football and the NFL on the sporting side. And so you can think about that a little bit. There also was a little bit of election upside, as well, in 2016.", "But, overall, the business is just in a very different place in terms of the resources and the size of the reach that we have right now with the salesforce.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two; the first one to Evan. There is very strong engagement and time spent on the platform, but the ad deceleration was pretty steep. You talked about removing friction in engagement. I'd be curious to hear about what are the main points of friction that you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars onto the platform? What excites you most to fix that over the next couple years? And then on discover, can you just talk about the type of engagement or user adoption you're seeing on discover and what are the main ways you can drive faster discover adoption? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, sure. I think the big issue with advertising over the next decade or so, frankly, is going to be education. I think we have world-class ad units. They are delivering ROI. We've done a lot of work this year to build out the measurement side of the business. And so I think now really it's an education process and I think early adopters are seeing great results. And so we've just got to keep showing people how Snap can really work for them and drive ROI.", "And then -- sorry. As far as the discover content is concerned, I think one of the things we're really excited about is our new Shows product. I don't know if you had a chance to see it, but basically it is total -- it is content created just for Snap. So rather than a lot of the video content you're seeing I think on mobile right now which is repurposed from TV or repurposed from the Internet, we've worked with some really outstanding partners to create some awesome shows.", "And I think right now, we have about one show a day. I think that will grow through the end of the year. And these are episodes like -- Second Chance, I think what was on today; and these are the types of shows that are drawing audiences over 8 million. So we're excited about that.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Imran, it seems like you have around 11 office locations right now around the globe. It seems like the vast majority of those are in the U.S., as well as the English-speaking countries. So, when can we start to see you guys start to go more aggressively after the other large ad markets in Continental Europe and elsewhere, so that we will start seeing the monetization gap between North America and Europe close? It seems like the users are catching up, but the revenue in Europe still seems to be about 1/10th of what you're reporting in North America right now. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're very pleased with our international growth. I think if you look at in Q1, 14% of our revenue came from international market. That is up from 7% a year ago. I think we're still early on with many market, like for example in Germany, we're just getting started. We're just getting started in Nordic markets and Netherlands and things like that. So I think as we continue to expand more sellers in those markets and continue to invest, I think you will see international continue to grow as a percentage of revenue.", "Stephen Ju", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.", "Ron Josey", "I just wanted to drill a little bit more into self-service, with 20% of ads delivered through the API in the first quarter and then the pending launch of the ads manager, can you just talk about the roadmap for self-service? The tools appear to be there with support across the ad formats and want to know if Lenses is included. And then how do you manage the channel conflict between Snap's salesforce and an ad manager? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think the -- first of all, 20% of Snap, that is what flowed through the API, not Lenses and Filters. And I think what we're really committed to that it is make it very easy for any advertisers to buy a Snapchat ad. And I think a lot of the large advertisers also want to use our self-service platform because they want to try out different creatives; they want to get more real-time result. And as well as a lot of small businesses who doesn't necessarily have access to sellers or agencies -- they also want to try it out.", "And I think what you will see us that over the next year or two and on an ongoing basis, is a continued investment to make it as frictionless as possible for everybody to buy ad on our platform.", "And with regards to channel conflict, the way we manage our channel conflict is the sellers have their clienteles and we got list that clienteles what platform and how they buy ads on the platform; they get credited towards that. So we have a pretty good -- we feel very good about the channel conflict management on that.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.", "Scott Devitt", "I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about geographic mix in terms of user growth. North America and Europe continue to outperform rest of world in terms of absolute DAU adds and how to think about that throughout 2017 and future years. And then secondly, just a clarification on the Spectacles revenue that Eric asked about earlier. Could you give the number of -- for Spectacles in 4Q? And then also in 1Q just to make sure -- understood what that $8 million was -- which quarter that was in. Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Yes, on the Spectacles side, just as a quick clarification, other revenue in the fourth quarter was I think a little bit more than $4.5 million. And so the numbers I gave earlier to Eric were first quarter other revenues were a little bit more than $8 million. So that will give you a little context. And really the program began in the fourth quarter.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as far as DAU growth, we're going to continue to focus on North America and Europe where we think we can deliver the most value for customers, based on their devices and the network. And longer term, obviously, we really believe that Snapchat is for everyone. And it's just early days for us, so we're focused in North America and Europe first.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge", "Two questions. Evan, in terms of the upcoming product roadmap, could you maybe discuss what you're excited about and perhaps how you see the cadence of product innovations progressing throughout the course of the year?", "And then maybe for Imran, you mentioned Universal doubled ad spend, 2016 versus 2015. Just your thoughts on ad demand in the U.S. in 1Q -- were you pleased with it? And then how is ad demand trending, thus far in 2Q? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "So I think at this point, we're kind of famous for not giving guidance on the product pipeline. But we're obviously really excited about it and we love surprising our community; so should be a fun rest of the year.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to ad business in Q1, I was very pleased with our Q1 ad performance. And I think, as you know, that our business has more focus on brand advertisings. That's how we got started and the brand business is very seasonal. But if by that on a year-over-year basis our business grew 286% on a year-over-year basis.", "And we continue to invest in both DR and brand and continue to make the advertising business as frictionless as possible which will help us to onboard many, many advertisers on the platform which should bode well for our future advertising business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "On the DAU number, can you unpack for us a little bit? A DAU, daily active user, is obviously an incredibly high bar. Can you unpack for us a little bit how much of the growth came from adding additional users to the platform versus engaging -- increasing engagement on the platform? And then from an advertising perspective, was there any impact to the quarter from changes in the sales organization or any sort of disruption there that you felt like would have allowed the Company to potentially grow advertising faster, had you seen more stability in the quarter?", "Imran Khan", "Look, I'm not sure what sales organization change you are mentioning; but I think we continue to grow our sales organization and continue to add a lot more people in the organization. And that continues to do very well. I think we're very fortunate to hire a lot of great talent in the organization throughout the quarter. And I think the salesforce is -- remained really very focused. And I'm very pleased with the execution we're doing. Evan, do you want to take DAU?", "Evan Spiegel", "I think we talk a lot about DAU as an engagement metric. Obviously we provided a couple extra metrics this quarter, like time spent which is over 30 minutes. And obviously an overall increase in sessions on a per user basis, so those are things we're excited about. And as I mentioned, I think the more that we can remove friction from this creative process, the more people want to use our service. And that's our strategy.", "Heath Terry", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Mark Zuckerberg opened up F8 essentially saying that they are now a camera company with an augmented reality API designed to let the whole world in and innovate. And while he didn't ever say it directly, it really sounded like he wants to bury Snapchat. So, I think the question that's on every investor's mind is does Facebook scare you, why or why not? And then I have a follow-up for Imran.", "Evan Spiegel", "Look, I think if there's one thing that I'd want to communicate today, it's probably just the overall importance of creativity to our business. And I mean this from every perspective, from the team that we hire to how they work together; the creative culture that we have; the products that we have that inspire people to create. And I think our overall strategy, obviously which is to deliver value through creativity. And I think the bottom line is, like, if you want to be a creative company you've got to get comfortable with and basically enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your products if you make great stuff.", "And I think we've seen this happen a lot in technology. When Google came along, everyone really felt like they needed a search strategy. When Facebook came along, everyone felt they needed a social strategy. And now I think with Snap, with our company, we believe that everyone is going to develop a camera strategy. Because I think we really help people understand how valuable the camera is, because it's really the center of everything that we do. And I think, at the end of the day, just because Yahoo, for example, has a search box, it doesn't mean they are Google.", "Richard Greenfield", "So just to follow up on the advertising side, either for you, Evan or for Imran. Why should an advertiser, just given the magnitude of the scale of Facebook versus Snapchat -- not to mention the advertising tools -- why advertise on Snapchat versus just dumping more money into Facebook?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, I think a bunch of reasons. Number one, we have incremental audience that we talked about. Number two, we're created -- I would argue that probably the best mobile ad product on the marketplace which is what many, many, many of our advertisers are seeing, superior ROI.", "Third, I think, fundamentally, advertisers want to advertise in many different platforms so that they can reach the -- advertise at different context. And fourth, we also have a very difficult to reach audience and a very, very engaged audience, as we talked about in my prepared remarks. All advertising starts with a strong engagement and we provide incredibly strong engagements. An average user is spending more than 30 minutes on the platform. So all of those reasons I think is very, very attractive to advertisers to be on our platform.", "Richard Greenfield", "Thank you for the answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "Just a DAU question again. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on the month-to-month trends, how you exited the quarter and early Q2. And maybe just remind us a little bit of the seasonality of your user growth and user engagement.", "And then in terms of host costs per DAU, I was under the impression those were largely a function of engagement. But you said that that wasn't necessarily the case in Q1. You talked about some savings from what you're doing on the partner and side. Should we expect that those kind of savings to continue at least for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, in terms of guidance, we don't want to give intra quarter guidance. As you know that advertising business is a seasonally -- seasonal business, where Q1 is seasonally weaker. And so our business will continue to face seasonality that we see on the broader advertising market. With regards to -- I think one of the things I keep want to highlight that I have been feeling very strongly about our ad business. Again, I think in addition to the ROI we're driving for advertisers, we're also providing a lot of powerful location data. So people Snapchat as a messaging app and people open the app many times. You see a lot incredible amount of location data and that's also very, very valuable. That's also driving a very strong ROI for everything -- in addition to everything I just talked about.", "So we feel very good about our advertising business. And beyond that, I can't really comment specific to the quarter.", "Mark May", "I was talking about the DAU seasonality, how to think about that in Q2 and seasonality combined with how you exited the quarter DAU. Seasonality.", "Imran Khan", "Again, I think if you look at our business, our user growth was driven by innovation. And as we continue to improve the performance and quality, that also driving the DAU growth. And I think in terms of beyond that, I don't think we should think too much about seasonality on that.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to cost of revenue and your question, cost of revenue was $141 million in the quarter. $99 million of it is hosting costs. Another $23 million is revenue share, so those really are the two primary components of what drive it.", "Hosting costs are paid directly to our third-party infrastructure providers. We have primary business with Google and we've also brought Amazon over as well recently. There are a series of headwinds and tailwinds in that business. Growing engagement, to your point and new users cost us more because they are variable cost contracts. The more that consumers use our app -- the more that they open it, the more that they Snap on in, they more they download content, the more that we incur charges.", "So in terms of the prices that we pay for those services, because we signed two new contracts, we got lower prices with both of those providers. And so that provided a significant tailwind for us. And it really was the upside that you saw in sequential costs. Our costs went from $113 million last quarter to $99 million there. And that is in a quarter where we saw significant growth in engagement in some of the main attributes as well as we saw the user growth. You can see we added another 8 million users in the quarter.", "So it really was that offset in pricing that we got from the two contract providers that really drove hosting costs lower. And revenue share is a piece of that. Revenue share was up slightly in the quarter. We had restructured a couple of deals. They are now more fixed-fee deals as opposed to percentage of revenue deals. Those will give us leverage if we're able to grow sales in the back half of the year; but, in the short term, raised our expenses in the first quarter.", "Mark May", "And I guess my question is as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, are you -- is host costs going to more than closely align with DAU and engagement growth? Or some of these cost savings from the new contract is going to continue to be a tailwind for the next couple of quarters?", "Drew Vollero", "The contractual pricing is, going forward, we signed a five-year deal with each of the companies, so it's new pricing that goes forward from this point. As it relates to where it all comes out, as I said, there is a series of headwinds and tailwinds. It really is a function, first and foremost, about engagement and how much engagement happens on the site and how many users that we add. Those really are what drive the costs. In terms of the year-over-year changes in the contract, the contract does have lower prices for our key services as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "A couple questions. Get a lot of questions on competition, so wondering if you can comment at all on churn as you look at your user base in Q4 or Q1. Any notable changes there, either Android or Apple platforms, would help us understand if competition is having any impact.", "And then on advertisers, just any thoughts on -- we saw the sequential decline, but how did you do on adding new advertisers in the first quarter? Did your total number of advertisers grow sequentially in Q1? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Overall, especially in the last half of last year, we had a really tough time with Android. That's still showing up in the numbers, as we mentioned. We added -- roughly 20% of our net adds from Android in Q4 and 30% in Q1. So we're making progress. But it's taking time and we're definitely digging out of a performance hole on Android. The low-hanging fruit, I would say, has been tackled in this past quarter, but we're making some larger structural changes that I think will make a big difference on Android over time.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, with regards to advertising, as we're -- continue to educate the market, one thing to keep in mind there our ad business -- we really start monetizing our business. The first ad ran on Snapchat in Q4 of 2014 and our ad business is still very, very nascent. So as we continue to educate the market, expand the sales force, opening new market, we continue to see more and more advertisers coming to our platform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel.", "Brian White", "Evan, I wonder if you could comment a little bit about the smartphone market. More smartphones are going to come with 3D sensors. It's going to support more AR activities. So I'm wondering how we should think about this as either a threat or an opportunity for Snap. So that's one question. Second question is just long term thoughts on China and also on Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Obviously all these improvements and sensors, et cetera, are really exciting for us and obviously fun to play with. The tough thing with any of these sort of device-specific improvements is that they are really hard for all of our community to enjoy. So instead, we've really invested in building a lot of our own technology that works well with a single camera. So you see that technology in World Lenses; it looks simple, but that surface detection is tricky to do with single-camera devices. And so we invested a lot in making these next-generation AR products available to our user base. But, yes, obviously always excited about new technology.", "And then -- sorry, the second question?", "Brian White", "Just on China. The long term thoughts on China and Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, thanks. Sorry about that. In terms of China, we've learned so much from the Chinese market. In the very early days, Tencent invested in our business and we had the chance to spend a lot of time with them. We've always been in awe, frankly, of the innovation happening over there. And that's really as far as our relationship with China has progressed today. But we've invested in building out some engineering there and obviously it's really exciting for our business.", "And then Japan -- obviously a great market and we've been working more recently to develop content that specifically appeal -- Lenses and Creative Tools that appeal specifically to the Japanese market. So that's a market we're excited about over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Maybe a quick one on the infrastructure side of things. You mentioned the deals with Google and Amazon. Maybe thinking about how you feel about the interchangeability between the two services. When you think about how you engineer, do you build stuff in a modular fashion so you can quickly move it over from one cloud to another? And any color or comments around that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, the thing you're talking about, sort of like containerization, I think is definitely the long term goal with products like this. But the interesting thing about the state of the cloud market today is really how these different providers have entered the market.", "So you have AWS which was really created because Amazon was trying to meet the needs of their customers around Christmastime. They built all this excess capacity and then rented it out. And Google, obviously, who has entered the market and they have a totally different and very specific use case around search.", "And so what ends up happening is that both of these companies build different services. And so, for example, recently we've moved some of our operations to an Amazon data store that's a little bit less redundant than a Google data store, for example, but saves us a bunch of money. So right now, I think we're really picking and choosing the different products we want to use based on the offerings from the two providers.", "But I do think, yes, long term, obviously, the dream for the cloud is this idea of containerization. And that's something we continue to invest in, but that -- that's a sort of a step-by-step, not an overnight kind of thing.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded.", "Thank you very much. Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2018, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2018 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and we make no obligation to update our disclosures.", "For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. This information can be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for Investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends.", "These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com.

This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We began 2018 with several major Snapchat updates, and we continue to make progress in growing our advertising business and building tools for advertisers.", "This quarter, we rolled out the redesign of our application. This new design is driven by our fundamental belief that separating friends from professional content creators is important to both our mission and the long-term growth of our business.", "For example, we have known for a long time that creating public-facing content is a very different behavior from interacting with close friends, which makes it challenging for both to exist successfully in the same ecosystem. Before the redesign, Stories were sorted by recency, meaning that people who post most frequently were usually at the top of the list. Naturally, the most frequently-posting users tended to be people who create content as part of their job, compared to users who are just sharing their day with friends. As our community continued to grow, keeping friends and creators in the same feed made Snapchat feel less personal, because close friends were constantly buried below creators.", "We addressed these issues by separating friends from creators and by making it easier to find Stories from the people closest to you. Now personal friends no longer have to compete with creators, and people can find Stories based on the depth of their relationships rather than who is posting most often. We also built a new home for creators in a newly expanded Discover section. This enables us to properly invest in products, discovery, and monetization for our creators, while also supporting a larger variety of content on Snapchat. The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both.", "As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption, especially given the high frequency of daily engagement of our community. While we had an average of 191 million daily active users in Q1, our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average. We are already starting to see early signs of stabilization among our iOS users as people get used to the changes, but still have a lot of work to do to optimize the new design, especially for our Android users. Our time spent remained more than 30 minutes per day on average following the redesign, and we have also started to realize some of the positive benefits, including increased new user retention for older users.", "We are now focused on optimizing the redesign based on our ongoing experimentation and learning. For example, when we separated friends\u2019 Stories from creator Stories, we also moved them to the left side of the camera and merged them into the Chat feed. We learned that combining watching Stories and communicating with friends into the same place made it harder to optimize for both competing behaviors. We are currently rolling out an update to address this by sorting communication by recency and moving Stories from friends to the right side of the application, while maintaining the structural changes we have made around separating friends from creators and sorting friends\u2019 Stories by relationships. The redesign created a lot of new opportunities, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to refine and improve Snapchat.", "This overall process is indicative of how we approach product development at Snap. We start with a core belief that builds on our mission of empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. In this case, it is our long-standing belief that separating social interactions from media content encourages people to create and share Snaps with each other, while also providing better opportunities and incentives for media partners. We then build and optimize our products around these underlying values, prioritizing them over short-term growth. ", "While doing so can often lead our company to take bigger risks and endure the accompanying volatility, we do this for two reasons. First, we firmly believe that it\u2019s the right thing to do for our community, because it ensures that our various products maintain a cohesive vision and stay true to our mission. Second, starting from first principles often leads us to create novel and unexpected experiences, which naturally tend to be longer-term opportunities that are difficult to optimize based on short-term results. ", "For example, our focus on self-expression and living in the moment from the very beginning took a long time for people to understand and get used to, but over the years has helped Snapchat become one of the most-used cameras in the world, with more than 60% of our daily active users creating Snaps with our camera, even as we doubled our user base over the past 2.5 years. Furthermore, one of the great things about our software products is that we can modify and update them any time. This makes it easier for us to take these risks, knowing that we are constantly learning and optimizing our products to better achieve our mission over the long term.", "Android performance is still a weakness for us, but we are making significant progress. Given the volume of changes we made with the redesign, a number of performance regressions contributed to a disproportionately negative impact among Android users, and we are currently working on addressing them. While the investments we made in our performance automation systems have significantly improved the speed and scale at which we are able to identify and fix these kinds of issues, our legacy codebase remains a problem. ", "I\u2019m really excited about the new version of the Android application that I talked about last year, which has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be lightweight, performant, and modular, which we hope will alleviate many of the performance-related issues we see with new product launches and updates. We have been testing the rebuilt application internally and we have quite a bit more work to do before our expected launch in Q3 of this year. In the meantime, we are incorporating some of the new modular components like Discover and the Friend Feed into the existing application, which we hope will improve performance in the near term.", "We continue to lead in mobile content and augmented reality, with a lot of progress in both this quarter. During the Winter Olympics, more than 81 million people watched our coverage on Discover in nine different languages, quickly surpassing the reach of our Rio Summer Olympics coverage. In the United States alone, over 10 million people on average tuned in every day at the Games. The redesign also enabled us to experiment with our first live streaming experience so that our users could watch key moments of the Olympics in real time wherever they were.", "Additionally, our content is starting to find its way outside of our application and into the world. During March Madness, Snaps submitted to Our Story appeared on stadium jumbotrons at each of the 67 games, as well as on local and national broadcast television coverage of the tournament. Over 200 media organizations have featured Snaps or embedded the Snap Map in their online, social, and broadcast television channels since we enabled the functionality just a few months ago. We believe that broadening the distribution of the unique Snaps created by our community will inspire more people to download Snapchat and create Snaps using our camera.", "We expanded our augmented reality platform and offerings significantly this quarter. Lens Studio has seen incredible adoption. Over 200 of the Lenses created by our community were viewed over 1 million times in the few months since launch. Our community has used these tools in ways we would have never imagined, and they have inspired us to invest more in empowering their creativity. We recently upgraded Lens Studio to now support the creation of new experiences like soundboards, interactive paths, and face Lenses. We\u2019re also expanding the underlying architecture of Lenses with Snappables, our latest Lens format that helps our community collaborate and interact with their friends through augmented reality experiences.", "Despite some headwinds from our redesign, our advertising business has continued to grow. While our decision to migrate our Snap Ads business to our programmatic auction led to a short-term slowdown in our revenue growth last year, we made the transition quickly and the company is far better for it. We are now better able to manage and optimize our overall advertising business and auction dynamics, which has accelerated the pace with which we can improve ROI for our advertisers. In Q1, both the average cost per app install and the average cost per swipe in the United States were well under half of what they were the year before, and we are continuing to make improvements.", "Our self-serve products helped us increase the number of advertisers actively spending on our platform by 20 times over the past year, and we still have a lot of opportunity to expand from here. With a growing advertiser base, we are now also introducing both paid and organic tools and experiences for companies of all sizes. Snapcodes unlock experiences like creative tools and sticker packs, and we are seeing brands experimenting with Lens Studio to create unique campaigns. Additionally, our product roadmap for empowering creators will also benefit small and large businesses alike and give them a better organic presence on our service.", "Our total revenue for the quarter was $230.7 million, up 54% from last year. Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners. We believe that our current path forward will address both issues, and that our advertising business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from the tough decisions we make in order to create and maintain a positive and healthy environment for our community over the long term.", "Thanks again for joining the call, and I will now turn it over to Imran to talk about our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi, everyone. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $229 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year. Evan talked about the philosophy behind the redesign, which is ongoing and a learning process. In Q1, we learned a lot based on how our users reacted to the redesign. But because of that, we also experienced some short-term disruptions to the business. The rapid pace at which we changed the core product introduced increased volatility into our ads marketplace. While we did not grow as quickly as we wanted, our Snap Ad revenue grew 102% year-over-year, and was down only 6% sequentially in a seasonally tough quarter.", "Additionally, during the quarter, we had many conversations with our advertisers about the redesign. These have been challenging conversations, as we made the proactive and deliberate decision to prioritize our long-term consumer product goals over our short-term monetization goals. The impact was primarily felt in our Sponsored Creative Tools business. On top of the expected seasonally weaker demand, our Lens and Filter products, which generally have a higher average selling price, were challenged by a negative market narrative.", "We\u2019re also in the middle of transitioning these products to a programmatic, audience-based buy model, which has negatively impacted the average order value, or AOV, for the products. For example, in Q1, the total number of Lenses sold was up 16% year-over-year, but AOV was down 37%. This is similar to what we experienced during our Snap Ad transition. As we transition all products to our self-service tool, we believe we can drive broader advertiser adoption and ultimately, a long-term, sustainable business.", "While we anticipate that some of these factors may continue to impact our business in Q2, I\u2019m very excited about the second half of this year. This is because of the progress we are making in our three focus areas: number one, enhancing our ad product suite, two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers, and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. In December, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Stories, which allows advertisers to leverage the familiar Stories format that our community knows and loves. But, to better reflect the storytelling capabilities of this format, we\u2019re now calling them Story Ads. We recently brought Story Ads to our self-service tool so that advertisers can use the same advanced targeting that they use for Snap Ads. Since launching this format in the auction, users that chose to watch Story Ads viewed them for an average of over 20 seconds. We believe this is a strong indication that our community is continuing to embrace this format.", "On the direct response side, we continue to make great progress. We believe that when we show the right ad to the right user, it creates a win-win situation. Swipe rates are one indication of whether or not we are creating this win-win situation. Quarter-over-quarter, for campaigns optimized for swipes, we increased our swipe rates by 8 percentage points, while also increasing total swipes by nearly 14 percentage points. This is a testament to the great work that our ad ranking team is doing to show the right ad to the right person.", "We\u2019re also continuing to evolve our formats, and I\u2019m really excited about our recent launch of shoppable Augmented Reality. Since bringing Lenses to market in 2015, we have seen this product drive tons of engagement and even create pop culture moments. But we wanted to bring the power of creative tools to our direct response advertisers. While users are playing with a Lens in the camera, advertisers can now include a button that will redirect them to a long-form video, website, or the app store. The first brands to try this new format include sports company Adidas, maker of the Candy Crush video games King, and make-up brand Clairol. As we scale adoption of this product, we are confident that it will help accelerate the growth of our Lens business as well.", "Our second area of focus is developing efficient tools for advertisers. As we have outlined before, one of our key priorities is to grow our SMB, or Online Sales, business. The vast majority of businesses are SMBs, and they are increasingly adopting digital marketing platforms to grow their businesses. In order to onboard these advertisers, we have been rolling out our self-serve tools and investing to create a frictionless ad buying experience. We made good progress this quarter as evidenced by 30% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for our SMB business.", "We are also launching sophisticated tools for our large advertisers. For example, we recently launched our Reach and Frequency tool for Snap Ads to a handful of select advertisers in the US and UK. This has been a key request from advertisers looking to plan and buy in advance on Snapchat. Only a few other scaled platforms have brought this tool to market, and it offers predictable delivery and pricing, something that is very valuable for larger brand-focused campaigns. ", "We launched Reach and Frequency within our self-service platform and are partnering closely with Unilever UK, P&G US, Google US and UK, and Microsoft UK. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do to fully bring this tool to market, but we're excited that this new buying method will empower advertisers to efficiently share their stories on our platform.", "One of the products I\u2019m most excited about is Snap Pro for Business and Creators. This product will be made for public entities, from public figures to local businesses to charitable causes, that want to use our platform to organically reach an audience beyond friends and family. With Snap Pro, it will be easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us. We\u2019re still extremely early in our roll-out plan and just recently onboarded a select group of brands and creators.", "For our third area of focus, we remain strongly committed to proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ROI is the best incentive that we can offer our advertisers, and we have been working tirelessly to show it across multiple products and verticals.", "This quarter, we made great progress scaling adoption and usage of Snap Pixel. We nearly tripled the number of advertisers using the pixel quarter-over-quarter. We\u2019re seeing that this capability drives strong results, primarily for our SMB and commerce advertisers.", "One great example is the Ridge, a wallet brand that used Snap Pixel to create both custom and lookalike audiences based on people who made a purchase on their eCommerce site. This strategy delivered. They drove a 4.1 times Return on Ad Spend. It also delivered a 55% decrease in Cost per Action, or CPA, allowing the company to achieve an overall CPA that was more than 20% lower than on other ad platforms.", "We are excited for the future of Snap Pixel as we continue investing in improvements such as the ability to optimize delivery based on lower-funnel events.", "We also understand how important it is for advertisers to measure impact across platforms. From television to social platforms, we want to demonstrate that advertising on Snapchat increases value to an advertiser\u2019s overall strategy. We recently collaborated with Nielsen, using their Total Ad Ratings, which allow advertisers to measure the incremental reach of their Snapchat campaigns relative to TV campaigns. Despite being outspent 25:1 by television, Snapchat campaigns were able to deliver 8% incremental reach on top of TV campaigns for the same set of brands.", "Finally, we are continuing to work with our third-party ecosystem to demonstrate ROI for all verticals. We conducted a series of custom marketing mix model studies with Nielsen to measure the effectiveness of Snapchat advertising within the beer category. The studies showed that Snapchat was more efficient than both traditional channels and other forms of digital media. Snap Ads outperformed the category media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.7 times, while Lenses and Filters outperformed the media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.3 times.", "Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and I\u2019m optimistic about the future of our business.", "Thank you for your time. I will now hand it off to Drew for a financial update.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. In the quarter, we made continued progress against our three financial goals: first, grow users and sales; second, leverage our cost structure; and third, soundly manage cash. As Imran mentioned, sales grew meaningfully year-over-year. Equally important, sales growth continues to well outpace our cost growth year-over-year.", "Over the past few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to make the right long-term decisions for our business. One of our core financial strategies was to invest early ahead of the sales curve to build the right cost structure that we could both scale with our growth and leverage over time.", "In the first quarter, we successfully leveraged our cost structure. Year-over-year sales growth was over 1.5 times our cost growth, and sequential costs were up only 1% in the quarter. On a per-user basis, ARPU increased 34% year-over-year, twice as fast as our CoRPU growth. Cost of revenue grew modestly, and operating expenses were sequentially down for the second time in three quarters, excluding restructuring charges.", "An efficient cost structure is a central part of our financial roadmap. We will continue to invest in strategic areas like innovation, new products, and people to fuel future growth. That said, we believe many of these opportunities can be funded by running our business more effectively, in areas like the back of house and hosting infrastructure. As we continue to successfully manage our cost structure, it should continue to yield two key benefits. First, we see strong incremental flow-through on revenue growth. And second, we can continue to moderate our cash burn, which we did again in Q1, as cash burn was less than half the rate from a few quarters ago.", "Let me now expand on the results for the quarter. First, global revenues were 231 million in the first quarter, and we saw growth in every region. International markets now represent 26% of our total revenue, up from 14% a year ago and 23% in Q4. Consistent with prior quarters, the fastest growing product in Q1 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold programmatically. Strength in Snap Ads more than offset softness in Creative Tools sales, which were down in the quarter.", "As expected, auction revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing. Let me share some numbers with you. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, were up over 450% year-over-year and over 15% sequentially. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Story Ads, was down nearly 65% year-over-year and nearly 20% sequentially. Third, we ended the quarter with 95% of our Snaps Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, served programmatically, up from 90% in the prior quarter.", "In the quarter, we added many new programs to the Discover page. In February, we partnered with NBC to bring the Winter Olympics to Snapchat users. We offered a series of creative ad products and packages to our advertisers, which drove incremental revenues for the business. Financially, the Olympics were a nice revenue boost, but comprised less than 10% of total revenues for the quarter.", "Now, let me talk about expenses. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures, including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Cost of revenue expenses grew $7 million in the quarter, driven by three factors. First, higher revenue share on Olympic content; second, incremental infrastructure costs related to the launch of the app redesign; and third, the addition of 4.2 million new DAUs. Hosting costs per user increased from $0.70 in Q4 to $0.73 in Q1, but hosting cost increases moderated during the quarter as our engineering team continued to optimize new code to reduce infrastructure expenses.", "On operating expenses, the primary driver remains people cost. Over the last few years, we have consistently invested to build an organization with the scale to compete. We hired over 2,400 people in the last two years and we\u2019re now digesting that rapid growth in an evolving world. As a result, during Q1 we had a 7% reduction in force, in order to better align resources around our top strategic priorities and reflect structural changes in our business.", "Consistent with earlier disclosures, the company recorded a charge of $9.9 million in the first quarter, but those charges have been adjusted out of EBITDA. We expect to realize $7 million to $8 million in ongoing savings per quarter. In the first quarter, OpEx costs were $257 million, down 1% sequentially, and overall headcount declined 3% for the period.", "Let me briefly touch on our capital-deployment priorities, which remain reinvesting in strategic areas of our business like product, content, AR, automation, and international expansion as well as opportunistic M&A. Q1 CapEx remained modest at $36 million and we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. As of March 31, 2018, total shares outstanding were 1.254 billion and 1.457 billion on a fully diluted basis.", "Let me now share some near-term observations on our business. First, as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels, with growth in auction impressions, partially offset by pricing for both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. We are planning for infrastructure costs to increase modestly in the short-term as we continue to test and rollout further changes to the application, partially offset by hosting cost efficiency programs. Revenue share expenses should moderate without Olympic content.", "We continue to plan for modest operating expense growth in the near term. Consistent with last quarter, we are planning for the first half of 2018 to grow by low double-digits versus the back half of 2017, excluding one-time charges. Please note operating expenses exclude cost of revenue, stock-based compensation, and our move to Santa Monica.", "Consistent with prior disclosures on the Venice exit, we expect to incur $25 million to $45 million in charges throughout 2018, primarily in the second and third quarters, to reflect the exit cost of these Venice buildings. The majority of these charges are cash payments due on remaining lease terms. We are planning for CapEx to be slightly elevated in the near term, as we continue our buildout of leased Santa Monica facilities and execute our move throughout 2018.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q1 expense was $143.2 million. Please note that this number included a one-time benefit of $32 million, as a result of the reduction in force plan we implemented during the quarter. We believe that the stock-based compensation rate in the second half of 2017 is a good proxy for the short-term. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Two questions, guys. One for Evan and then one for Drew. Evan, on the DAUs, it seems like anytime you guys are making changes to the Android app, you're running into some performance issues and DAUs tend to drop off. So I guess what gives you the confidence as you ship this new Android code in the second half of this year that we'll see a stabilization and when do you expect Android to use to start kind of consistently picking up.", "And then Drew, you mentioned the 2Q revenue growth will be substantially lower, so would that just be Olympics impact coming out or can you talk a little bit more specifically about the deceleration in ad revenue versus the 61% in the first quarter. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi, Ross. We should have made a lot of changes faster in our engineering organization and really put Android first. Now, and I'm starting -- last year, we started re-architecting the entire application and rebuilding it from scratch and we now have a bunch of those components and we're testing some already in the application, but ultimately it\u2019s the re-architecture that will make a big difference and I think beyond just the performance improvements that we're going to see, it will also enable our entire team to move a lot faster as we build new features. Right now, if we build a new feature, the codebase is so complex, we tend to break other things and I think reducing the complexity through modularization will make a huge difference in our ability to execute quickly on the product roadmap.", "Drew Vollero", "So Ross, as it relates to the second quarter, we were really focused on the strategic activities in business, not necessarily the near term financial targets. We're really focused on improving the redesign, improving Android, driving users to platform, driving our advertiser ROI. If you look at the platform itself at the product level, we have strength in Span Ads that direct response business is doing quite well internationally, has been a growing force as well. But look, at the end of the day, we are transitioning right now to the creative tool business Imran talked about in his opening remarks and we really are focused on being the value leader in the advertising platform and so what we're not doing is playing the pricing game to maximize short term revenues. We're really more focused on bringing advertisers to the platform and making sure advertisers have solid ROIs. There was a modest boost in the quarter as you mentioned, to Olympic revenue, which we don't expect to continue in Q2, but that's not a big piece of the story here.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mark Mahaney", "In the past, I think you've talked about crash levels on the Android app, any sort of update there as to how they're trending? And then you talked about this disruption to users. What have you seen in the quarter so far in terms of those disruptions to users, any impact on engagement? Does it seem to you like you're back to normal with your users\u2019 use of the app? Is there still a lot of experimentation just how would you address the volatility of the overall user base in response to the redesigns?", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. No specific updates on the crash levels. I do want to talk about one of the big changes that we're making to Snap, which I think will make a big difference. When we redesign the application, we combine the stories and chats from your friends onto the same page. And we like having all the stuff from your friends in one place, because it was a lot easier to find, but we didn't realize how hard it would be to optimize for those two different behaviors, talking with friends and watching their stories and it turns out it's really hard to optimize for both at the same time. So one of the biggest changes that we're making is moving stories from your friends over to the Discover page and putting it at the top of the page. So they'll still be separate from all the other content on our service, but that way your friends come first, no matter where you are in the application, but we can still optimize for watching content on one side of service and communicating with friends on the other. So that's a big change coming and we think it will make a difference.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "Great. Two things. I think in your prepared remarks, you said users were stabilizing in April, maybe you could revisit that a little bit? And then Imran, how much of the 2Q deceleration is related to the redesign and how are you thinking, you mentioned you expected a big back half, how would you think about an improvement in the back half on advertising?", "Imran Khan", "Yes. Hi. So let's take the second question first. So I think one of the things that we have done, we listen to our advertisers very closely and what are the products that they want and I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about how we will have launched reach and frequency with two advertisers. We also launching SNAP Pro, which will let people to create content and then ultimately promote those content. We are also launching lower funnel optimization for our performance advertising products. All of those things, I think, will significantly help our advertisers to take leverage of our platform. And then on top of that, what we're doing in terms of on ad ranking side by improving swipe rate and showing the right ad to the right users. And as our mission gets better and better, I think there's a lot of opportunities on that. So I'm really optimistic that I think we're doing the right thing and building the right thing.", "In terms of Evan\u2019s comment on, I think we said we are seeing early sign of stabilization on iOS.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Evan, I think at the time of the IPO one of the concerns was the need for your ad ops teams to essentially vet the creative, so that if fits in with the surrounding content and does not work against a consumer experience, but now that you are going more self-service, you have certain instances, which I guess result in the negative market creative, you touched on earlier. So it seems like there's a need to police the add creators as well, so is there a technology base or some other type of solution that can look for that type of ad content to take down? And Imran, a question on the story is the need to reformat the ad content to vertical presentations still a headwind for you? And if so, what are you doing to help advertisers either from a technology or proper perspective?", "Evan Spiegel", "Stephen. Yeah, we have a lot of empathy for the ad reviewers who work on our business. It's a tough job. We really consider them digital first responders in a sense and so we're definitely building out a lot of programs to try and help them do their jobs more effectively and we always feel terrible when mistakes are made, but we're making progress there and really we want to do our best to support the team and doing their job.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to story ad, I think what we're seeing that market is more and more embracing our format. I think 3.5 years ago, when you started the ad business, I think this full screen vertical video was very foreign to many advertisers and we heard a lot of pushback, but I think over the years, we have seen that advertisers are seeing the value of the full screen ad and the storytelling ad and we're seeing that other advertisers, other publishers also embracing these formats. So I think it is -- the headwind is getting better and I think we're also building a lot of creatives and I think one of our mission is creating friction less application experience and I think we're making a lot of progress there and we continue to invest on that technology.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "We\u2019ve seen some of the changes that you're talking about in terms of separating out stories and from Snaps and sort of the next evolution of this redesign, realize, it's extremely early, but any sort of indication in terms of how users are reacting to that. I know you're not going to go into specific metrics, but just even qualitatively what you're hearing from them? And then to the extent that we're sort of seeing pricing fluctuation, the way we are in the early innings of your moves into the programmatic, any sense sort of where pricing on any sort of like for like basis is shaking out between where Snap and other major digital platforms would be? I know it's not always easy to compare apples and oranges, but whether it's a ROI metric or price per engagement, would be curious in any benchmarking you might be able to share insight into.", "Evan Spiegel", "When we build products, we\u2019re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away, we're thinking a lot about how our products that we've built will help us accomplish our mission. So, we build things that we believe that will help us empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And so I think it's really important to understand that people think about self-expression on Snapchat in different ways. So some people would rather create content with just a small audience of their friends and other people want to create content if they have a much bigger audience because they want to reach more people. ", "And so our job is to make Snap work well for all different types of people so that we can empower people to express themselves. And with the redesign in particular, we try to make Snapchat feel more personal for people who want to use it exclusively with their friends and also more valuable for people who want to use at large audience, because we want to do both really well. So we believe the redesign brings us closer to accomplishing our mission. And we're continuing to iterate very quickly on the things that we don't like.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to pricing, we are really focused on driving advertisers ROI and bringing more and more advertisers on our platform, because when you have a lot more users, we have more choices to show to the right users. And I think we're also a new platform, so we want advertisers to learn our platform and how to win on our platform. And so fundamentally, we're not really focused on pricing right now, we are really more focused on bringing more advertisers on the platform and helping them understand our platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "I think you mentioned earlier that pricing is down 65% year-on-year and then when talking about the substantial de-sell [ph] in Q2, I think you noted that pricing is a primary driver there. I guess the question is where are we in that adjustment period and at what point do you expect that pricing will begin to stabilize? And then in terms of the redesign we\u2019re putting friends\u2019 stories above discover content, what impact do you think that that will have on engagement with commercial content and ultimately with some of the ad revenues that flow through that part of the channel.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to pricing, the 65% decline year-over-year really represents the change in selling method, we used to have a direct sales force that sold of the ads top of funnel. Now, we\u2019ve gone to programmatic, and so that's really led to the year-over-year decline. I'll echo Imran\u2019s sentiments, right now, the key activities that we're focused on are really bringing advertisers to the platform. We need a broader base of advertisers using our product and then see if really we're very focused on ROI. We do think that will be the number one metric for us in the long term success. So that's what we're focused on far more than sort of where pricing bottoms out. We don't have the near term plan for that.", "Evan Spiegel", "In terms of the Discover product, we believe that making Snapchat is the best place to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. We will build a larger audience for creators and ultimately benefit them and we\u2019re also introducing a lot of new tools this year for creators, which we believe will inspire them to continue creating great content for Snap. So ultimately, we're taking a long view here and we believe that as users experience our products, we will be able to build our audience and that will benefit creators.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Two if I can. First Imran, I think you said March average DAU is lower than 1Q average, but still up in the 4Q average, which seems to imply that maybe March ended lower than where you were in December kind of on a period end basis. Can you kind of talk about if April is down from March and then do you think the early results from moving friends\u2019 stories back to the right side of the camera does suggest that allowing help stabilize DAU?", "And then secondly, can you give us a sense for what percent of ad revenue now is coming from performance advertisers and maybe a sense of how the more sophisticated performance advertisers who have adopted the best most sophisticated tools, how they\u2019re scaling budgets plus those adoption rates. Can you maybe give us an update on the percent of at Ad Age 100 that are still spending if you will from the kind of 1Q \u201916 period, so can you give us that would be great.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I'll take from the like last question first. Look. I think we're seeing great success with a lot of the large advertisers. We strengthen our relationship with several brands like take McDonald's as an excellent example, they have pushed a multiproduct approach for nearly every campaign, always looking to test, optimize and learn with us. In fact, they were one of the first advertisers to test audience filters in action, creating seven different filters and targeting each one to a niche audience. ", "But most importantly, over the years, Snapchat has gone from being a platform that McDonald's would leverage periodically to an always on long term partners. Year over year, McDonald's grew their investment triple digit with us. So we're really pleased, we had a lot of success stories like that. We're becoming true business partner for a lot of large advertisers but at the same time we're seeing healthy growth in our performance advertising campaign. And I think we\u2019ve got great feedback from them and based on that, we're trying to bring creative tools also to the DR customers and that business is going at a very healthy rate and we're very, very excited about it.", "With regards to DAU, I think we gave you the average for the quarter was 191 million. Q4 average was 187. I believe what Evan talked about in his prepared remarks that March was lower than our Q1 average of 191, but higher than the Q4 average of 187. So that should give you a pretty good guidance where that numbers were in March.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.", "Jason Helfstein", "I wanted to dig a bit more. So for all the examples of McDonald's of triple digits, I guess how much of the weakness or relative to what we're all expecting was from advertisers who pulled back because of call it misunderstanding or questions or publicity and so the point is like what did it take to get those advertisers back. And is that -- the point being you expect those advertisers to be back in the third quarter, just go a little bit deeper into that, what caused the advertisers toward spending to pull back and what makes you -- and what gives you confidence they come back.", "Imran Khan", "Look, I think -- thanks for asking the question. At the end of the day, advertisers are rational. They want to advertise and they want to drive return on their ad spend. But at the same time, they're human. When there's a lot of negative news on the press every day, it does give people pause, it does influence people buying decisions, know it's very hard to handicap how what percentage, but that does come out on the conversation and become a disruption on the selling process. But I think the way to win is by proving otherwise, right. The examples like McDonald's or some of the examples that I shared on the call, when we go and prove that, but I just had the money that this spent and we drive value for them. ", "It's really, really important. I think one of the things that is really important to understand that the Snapchat\u2019s position in the millennial audience, right, there are over 90 million millennials in the US today and they represent the single largest generation ever defined. Millennials are expected to become a huge economic force in the coming years that already dominating lot of buying decisions. And we have a very strong position in that demographic and some of the investment that our product team and engineering team did to swing the right ad to the right audience. I think that we -- and we just need to prove those ROIs and educate the market and that's ultimately drive value for everybody.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge ", "So ad impressive growth has been significant the past several quarters, just wondering how you feel about ad loads and ability to raise ad loads and then just any update on engagement. I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it, time spent on the platform, anything there would be helpful?", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think again -- I think about the problem is ad is a piece of content and when it's a piece of content, you have to show the most relevant content to the most relevant person and that really drives the engagement, right. If I show you one content that you don't care about it, if I show you one piece of content, you will be annoyed. If I show you three great pieces of content that you really, really like and you want to engage with it, that you will like it. So I think rather than thinking about the ad load, what we have been challenging our product team and our engineering team, are we doing the best job showing the most relevant content to our users. When you do that, everybody wins. And I think one of the thing I talked about in the call that how we saw 8 percentage point increase in swipe rate. And I think that's really, really exciting and that's something I think there's a lot more work to be done and we continue to push out teams to do that. ", "In terms of time spent, I think Evan mentioned in the call that more than over 30 minutes people are due to spend on our platform, over 30 minutes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Just first you talk about self-serve helping increase the advertiser number 20x over the past year. Just curious if you\u2019ve quantified that number? And then, Imran, can you just talk more about the concept, the moving to always on spending and how much that's actually happening across the platforms at this point? And then just quickly, do you think you're seeing any impact in users from competitive entertainment like Fortnite and PUBG?", "Imran Khan", "So with regards to -- look I think in terms of number of advertisers, we launch our self-serve platform in Q2 of last year. So it's a very new platform. So we have a lot of room to grow our number of advertisers on our platform, and I think so we have a lot of work to do and we're very pleased with the growth, but we want to grow faster and there's a lot of room to grow.", "With regards to competitive pressure from other games like Fortnite, my son who is 8 years old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend, but I think it's really hard for me to sit here and predict how that's spending impacting time on our platform at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two. The first one, appreciate the color on the Snap ad versus the creative tools, the lender\u2019s growth in the quarter. Wondering, could you talk us through how we should think about the growth trajectory of those two businesses over the course of the year, maybe the relative size and just to think about the puts and takes on revenue growth between those two buckets this year?", "And the second one, you talked a lot about a focus to bring more advertisers on to the platform. Maybe talk through philosophically how has your advertiser onboarding process changed between large advertisers and SMBs. What are the keys to success going forward?", "Drew Vollero", "Good. As it relates to the product mix, we never really quantify the difference between the Snap ads and the creative tools. We gave some sense maybe a couple of years ago about the size of a business we described in a sort of a good one two combination and both very meaningful to our business. I would say with the move to programmatic over the last six to twelve months, the Snap Ads business has become a much bigger piece of our business than the creative tools. And so the Snap Ads business continues to grow. We have good traction internationally. We have good traction on the DR side of the world. So we are definitely seeing that being the engine that\u2019s fueling our growth right now. I think the creative business will continue \u2013 the creative tool business will continue to transition that as we commented on in the second quarter here, those are -- that's what we're seeing in the near term. So right now, the bulk of the revenue is being driven by the Snap ads business and that's really the engine that's going to fuel our growth in the near term.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think to add on Drew\u2019s color, I think our creative tool business also have a lot of opportunities like more recently we launched Lens Studios for example. It really democratize who can create lenses. I think one of the big challenge for a lot of the small businesses to create creative tools is that they have to work with us directly, but as the Lens Studios and those things proliferated, they have the opportunities for a lot of advertisers to embrace this creative tools business, that's also opened up new revenue opportunity for us. So I think we feel very excited about that, how we are monetizing camera and at the same time, we\u2019re monetizing content on our platform and how there are a lot more opportunities to do that. ", "With regards to your second question, how you\u2019re addressing the market, we break up ourselves in two different groups. One is DSO, direct sales organization who focus on the large advertisers and they are really a sales consultant for those. The second bucket is our global online sales team, so that has combination of inside sales and our channel partners. So we partner with other channels who actually sell on behalf of us as well. So that's how we were trying to cover across the market and educate them about the platform and to help onboard more and more advertisers on the platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Rich Greenfield", "Hi. A few questions. First just housekeeping. I wanted to follow up on the question before regarding Evan's commentary on DAUs If you look at kind of March 2018 quarter end, should we infer basically, is the inference essentially that March quarter end for \u201918 was actually below December 2017 quarter end? And then two, on product, Evan, you mentioned shifting friends\u2019 content over to the right, which I certainly understand, but part of the new right side redesign not only was it algorithmic, but it was also kind of everything. ", "So it was like one solid flowing experience where it almost felt like you got lost and you were just clicking, you have this kind of infinite array of content. Now, as you start to separate out friends from everything else, discover, kind of brand/implementers, how does that impact time spent in the discover/influencer content on the right side relative to friends? And then just a part of that, could that actually cause a disruption as you kind of shift the stories back to the right, are we looking at another potential disruption in user behavior, as people get used to that type of a change back. That would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So overall, as we look at the redesign, the thing that we're most excited about is creating this infinite scroll content. As you mentioned, in the past, the right side of the application really only had your friends\u2019 stories and a very small select group of publishers without a lot of personalization. And so I think one of the really great things that we've been able to accomplish with the redesign is putting your friends at the top, making them most important, but also still opening up into this world of personalized content below. So I think, we're going to get the best of both worlds in that sense and still create an environment where people feel empowered to express themselves.", "And I don't think we can give you any specifics on the earlier DAU question, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore.", "Anthony DiClemente", "I just wanted to follow up on that question about content. In terms of \u2013 it just sounds based on what you\u2019ve said Evan that there could be a transition and emphasis to user generated content, given the changes in the Discover tab and I guess if not, maybe just what is your forward strategy with respect to licensed professional content from here?", "And then a question for Drew, you stated in your prepared remarks that future acquisitions will likely be additive to stock-based compensation. So I'm curious what areas is Snap actively pursuing in terms of M&A and how do you think about balancing the potential M&A with your priorities around cash management from here?", "Drew Vollero", "Let me take the second one first and then I'll turn it over to Evan. Look, we've had a lot of success managing our cash burn rate over the last couple of quarters. We've reduced it by over 50%. How we've done that is we\u2019ve really focused the strategic capital deployment priorities here at the company. We're really focused on investing in our business. The M&A here will be very opportunistic. If we see the right thing at the right time at the right price, we\u2019ll go ahead and make that happen, but right now, we're focused on really the key strategic activities of growing our business around the design, around the Android, new advertisers\u2019 ROI, those are the strategic priorities in the business. If we have a chance to be opportunistic, with an acquisition, we will go ahead and do that. Historically, the acquisitions have been pretty tuck-in in nature. They've been focused more on technologies and talent than they have been sort of robust acquisitions, big companies, big business models, et cetera. So that's where we've been focused to date. And I'd look for again our strategic priorities for cash really to be the investment in the business.", "Evan Spiegel", "Ultimately, users\u2019 content has obviously been a strong suit for us for a very long time, because we're so focused on powering creativity, opening to the camera and building all these creative tools that inspire people to create. I think as we look at the redesign and the opportunity for publishers and creators, we're definitely excited about the progress we\u2019ll be able to make for both last year, we delivered $100 million in revenue to our partners and we're excited to build on that. So I think publishers will play a very important role in the future and also create more opportunities for creators and influencers to be successful on Snap.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust.", "Youssef Squali", "Two quick questions for me. First, maybe Evan, you referenced changes in market narrative as a reason for the softness. Just trying to understand kind of the other side of that is for the market narrative to change again, I'm assuming this is on the advertiser side, there is really no control necessarily in terms of timing. So you talked about how Q3 is going to be an inflection point for that, just trying to get a sense of, if advertisers have now, so to speak, put you guys in the penalty box, what kind of gives you the confidence that you can get out of it within a quarter? ", "And then on the profitability side, there were some news reports talking about how maybe you gave directives internally to accelerate dramatically accelerate the profitability of the business. First, is there any truth to that? And second, how do you look at and maybe this is a question for Drew partly as well, balance out the profitability versus the doubling down of the investments as you suggest in your prepared remarks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So in terms of profitability, obviously, building a sustainable business is what's going to allow us to pursue our mission for a really long time. So it's something we think about and I think we've made great progress over the last few years towards being able to fund our own growth. I think if we look at the big transition we made last year to our programmatic advertising business, I think the really great benefit of that is we've gotten a lot better at showing advertisers ROI, so the market narrative I think will matter less over time, as we continue to improve our measurement capabilities and to really deliver that for advertisers. So excited about the progress that we're making there. And you're right that it's important to focus on the performance business.", "Drew Vollero", "So, I will -- just to build on Evan's comments, I mean, it makes sense for us to build toward a breakeven. It's a logical next step for our business, but let's be clear, we really don't manage against that. There is no timeline to take that of the certain date. The key thing to remember is that, that's going to for us begin with growth. We need to continue to grow our user base. We need to grow our revenues. We\u2019re going to keep investing in areas like product innovation, AR and content to name a few. That said, Snap for breakeven also is going to revolve around carrying water in both shoulders for us, you have to be sensible about our cost structure. We have a moderate cost growth where it makes sense. We have a large infrastructure for a company our size. We\u2019re built for growth and you saw that in Q1 that we were able to leverage the cost structure, our cost growth was only up 1% sequentially. So there are opportunities for us to do things better and that should allow us to continue to make investments that will fuel our growth.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap, Inc's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO.", "Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the third quarter of 2017, which can be found on our Investor Relations' website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call. As we are rapidly approaching the end of 2017, I thought it might be useful to speak to our progress against the three priorities I shared earlier this year; performance, quality, and automation, and discuss our three new priorities for 2018; user growth, content, and augmented reality. We have been very focused on making progress against performance, quality, and automation this year, and are beginning to see the results of these efforts. Application performance has increased considerably, and we have made meaningful progress against key customer facing metrics.", "For example, since April, we have reduced the average time it takes for Android users to start our camera application by over 20%. Camera startup time is very important for Snapchat because people use our service to quickly capture moments to share with friends. As part of our quality efforts, we have been building a new world-class device lab for test automation and quality assurance. We've also distributed a wide variety of Android handsets across our engineering organization to ensure that we have ongoing qualitative feedback on Android application performance and design.", "In Q3 alone, Snapchat was used on over 60,000 different Android model variants. Given the sheer volume of different Android handsets used to access Snapchat, we have had to establish new processes to ensure that our quality efforts can be maintained. This will be an ongoing investment, but I am pleased to say that this quarter, monthly crash rates across both iOS and Android reached an all-time low since we started tracking this metric early last year.", "Our efforts at automation have gained traction very quickly this year, with 80% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically in Q3, up from zero%, one year ago. The speed of this transition surpassed our expectations, but has dramatically reduced pricing as advertisers move from direct sales to our unreserved auction. This has decreased CPMs more than 60% year-over-year, which has made it harder to grow revenues at the rate we would have liked. I am grateful that this transition is nearly behind us, and look forward to the many advantages our programmatic auction brings to our advertising business in terms of scale and ROI.", "The number of advertisers spending in our auction grew nearly 5 times from the beginning of the quarter, one of the many early indicators that our self-serve tools are making it easier for more advertisers to reach our audience. I'm excited about the case studies that Imran will share with you a bit later in the call.", "The substantial decline in average CPMs during our transition to the auction has meant that the majority of our revenue growth has come from a dramatic increase in impressions. This has been a good test for our business, because we are always concerned that an increase in ad load will negatively impact user engagement. Fortunately, we have seen user engagement continue to grow at a meaningful clip, with time spent, frequency of use, and Snap creation all increasing, while Snap Ad impressions have grown over 400% year-over-year. This increase in ad impressions combined with the simultaneous growth in user engagement bodes well for the long-term success of our advertising business. Of course, overall ad load remains very low, and we will continue to monitor user engagement as ad load increases over time.", "I am proud of our team for executing relentlessly against our priorities in 2017, and I feel that we have built a solid foundation for the future. Looking ahead to 2018, our team is focused on user growth, content, and augmented reality.", "This quarter, we grew our Daily active users at a lower rate than we would have liked, adding 4.5 million new users. This can be partially attributed to our decision to report our daily active users as an average over the entire quarter, where a strong September was offset by the more modest months of July and August. Ultimately though, we want to drive more user growth in 2018.", "We are fortunate to grow our business from a position of strength with a young audience in the developed world, the tip of the spear that drives broader adoption trends across the technology ecosystem. For example, we now reach over 70% of the 13 to 34 year-old population in the U.S., France, the U.K., and Australia. However, in order to further scale our user base, we need to accelerate the adoption of our product among Android users, users above the age of 34, and users in the Rest of the World markets. This means that we will have to make some changes to our product and business.", "To attract more Android users, we are building a new version of our Android application from the ground up that we will launch in select markets before rolling it out widely. This new version of our application leverages everything we have learned about building for Android over the past five years, to provide a more performant product experience that we know our community will appreciate. This effort requires significant engineering resources across all of our engineering teams and will be a huge focus over the coming year. After seeing the results of increasing Android performance over the past few months, with significantly more Android users added than iOS users in September, we wish we had done this sooner.", "The one thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback. As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use. There is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application. We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business.", "High-speed and affordable wireless connectivity is necessary for the use of our application, and this has proven to be an obstacle for growth in the Rest of World markets. We are taking action both internally and externally to improve connectivity for our community. Internally, we are focused on product improvements like our new streaming architecture for Story playback. This updated architecture means that we no longer have to download an entire video file before we initiate playback, which ultimately results in a better user experience and more efficient use of the network. Externally, we are exploring partnerships with select wireless carriers who can help us to provide our service at a lower cost to our community.", "Content is becoming an increasingly important part of our business, as many of our early investments and partnerships have begun to bear fruit. It has been nearly three years since we launched Publisher Stories, and I have been so excited to see the tremendous progress we have made together with our partners. Additionally, Our Story has grown from a one-off event-based product to an always-on content experience, discoverable first in Stories and now in Search and Maps.", "Our coverage of the recent hurricanes in the United States demonstrated the breadth of the Snapchat content experience, with unique perspectives across Publisher Stories, Shows, Our Stories, and the Snap Maps. Over 3,500 hours of storm-related Snaps were submitted to Our Story, providing an intimate and near real-time perspective of those devastating events. We heard that many users that had evacuated the area were able to keep an eye on their neighborhoods using Snap Maps.", "Professional journalism continues to play an important role on Snapchat, and provides important context to user-submitted Snaps. Stay Tuned, a twice-daily show produced by NBC, reached over 12 million, 13 to 24 year-old viewers in the United States in September, making it one of the most popular news shows for young people in the country, almost overnight.", "As part of the redesign I mentioned earlier, we are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day. We think that there is a big opportunity to surface some of this content in a personalized and more relevant way, while still maintaining the exploratory nature of our service. We are developing a new solution that provides each of our 178 million daily active users with their own stories experience, leveraging the tremendous benefits of machine learning without compromising the editorial integrity of the Stories platform that we have worked so hard to build.", "As part of our efforts around Search and Maps, we now index millions of stories every day, meaning we have the long tail of content necessary to provide a truly personal experience. We hope that showing the right stories to the right audience will help grow engagement and monetization for our partners and for Snapchat.", "While we have made significant progress in our work to empower the creation of user-generated content from friends, and premium content from publishers, we have historically neglected the creator community on Snapchat that creates and distributes public stories for the broader Snapchat audience. In 2018, we are going to build more distribution and monetization opportunities for these creators in an effort to empower our creative community to express themselves to a larger audience and build a business with their creativity.", "Developing this ecosystem will allow artists to transition more easily from communicating with friends to creating stories for a broader audience, monetizing their stories, and potentially using our professional tools to create premium content. Snapchat has likely become the world's most-used camera, with more than 3.5 billion Snaps created every day, up more than 40% year-over-year. According to InfoTrends, this is now greater than the average number of photographs taken every day this year across all phones, tablets, and digital cameras combined, excluding Snapchat. The strength of our close friend network that drives high frequency engagement means that our community opens our application an average of 25 times per day, creating numerous opportunities to inspire creativity.", "Augmented reality is one of the many ways that we inspire our community to create Snaps. With the tap of a finger, lenses transform the world around you and make even the most boring of situations infinitely more snappable. In September, we released 3D Bitmojis, which have increased the use of world lenses by more than 20%. In October, we collaborated with Jeff Koons to place installations of his iconic sculptures in locations around the world, and more recently, we've helped the NBA create unique characters to bring team spirit to their arenas around the United States.", "With all of the excitement and creativity inspired by each new lens on Snapchat, we are working hard to democratize lens creation so that anyone anywhere can create and publish their own lenses. We have been testing our Lens Studio product with a select group of advertising and creative partners, who have already created amazing lenses with our tools. We'll be investing in improving our own platform and tools, as well as making our Lens Studio more widely available to empower the creativity of our community, much in the way that we have with our Geofilters product. With over 5 million Geofilters submitted in the past two years, we can't wait to see all of the lenses created by our community.", "Context Cards represent the next generation of our augmented reality products, with information and actions overlaid on the content that our community is watching. We will be building on top of the Context Cards framework with additional partners as we learn more from our community about how they want to use this new product. With all of the snaps and stories viewed on our service every day, Context Cards provide a unique opportunity to translate what you see on the screen into action, whether online or in the world around you.", "2018 promises to be a productive and exciting year for Snap, with many changes coming to our products and platform. We will be hard at work delivering on our priorities; user growth, content, and augmented reality.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Imran to discuss our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $204 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter. This represents healthy growth, but we're working tirelessly because we want to grow revenue faster. I want to focus my time today on a few factors that we believe have set us up well for strong growth in the future quarters. One, transitioning the majority of our business to self-serve; two, addressing the needs of our increasingly diverse advertiser mix; and three, democratizing our Sponsored Creative Tools so that all advertisers can use them. I'll talk about how each of these factors challenged us and what we are doing to address them.", "First, we have been focused over the past year on transitioning the majority of our Snap Ads business to self-serve. We launched our Ads API a year ago. This marked the beginning of our transition to programmatic advertising. We followed it in June with our own self-service tool. The transition to self-serve is an important part of scaling our business for a number of strategic reasons. For instance, in our auction platform, advertisers can now specify and optimize delivery against certain business objectives, such as driving app installs or video views. With this framework, we can address the needs of many more advertisers and help them achieve their desired business goals at scale. We have also made it easier for advertisers to test and learn. The auction has lowered the entry price point by three orders of magnitude, making it more accessible to all advertisers. And, our self-serve tools have made it possible to manage campaigns with ongoing testing and real-time improvements.", "Given these strategic reasons, we have been very aggressively transitioning our Snap Ad, or full-screen mobile video business to self-serve. And advertisers' adoption has been tremendous. Today, over 80% of Snap Ad impressions are being delivered programmatically. This is up nearly 3 times from Q1 of this year and up from 60% since last quarter. However, our auction has a lower price-point than our reserved business because there is no fixed rate card. As we transition more and more of our business to the auction, this had a meaningful impact on overall pricing.", "While this diminishes revenue in the short term, it builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue. As we onboard more advertisers and multiple advertisers compete for the same ad impression, we should see higher pricing. In fact, we are already seeing this happen in some auction segments. The number of advertisers spending in the auction is up nearly 5 times since the beginning of the quarter. This has resulted in sequential growth in the number of contested auctions, and our data shows that these prices are, on average, higher than uncontested auctions.", "Increasing the number of advertisers on Snapchat is foundational to building an efficient marketplace, and our self-serve tools help us do this at scale. More advertisers, means a greater variety of ads which is a win-win situation for both our advertisers and our community because it helps us to deliver the right ad to the right person. We are confident that increasing the number of advertisers, combined with our ongoing machine learning efforts, will lead to better results for our advertisers, better experiences for our community, and higher pricing for us in the long-term.", "I would like to share an example of how our self-service auction platform is helping our customers achieve their objectives. Peak Labs, a U.K.-based brain training app, leveraged our auction for an app install campaign. They developed over 10 different Snap Ad creatives to keep the ads fresh and engaging. Using the auction's real-time reporting capabilities, Peak was able to rotate creatives on a bi-weekly basis, analyze performance via A/B tests, and optimize efficiency for the overall campaign. Results were great. After two months, Peak drove 1.7 million app installs at a cost per install that was 50% lower than other platforms where they were advertising.", "The second area of focus for us is addressing the needs of our increasingly diverse advertiser mix. As we onboard more advertisers, it is critical that we understand the nuances of each vertical and customer type. Last year, we were focused on large advertisers, over half of our revenue in 2016 was tied to large share of voice or sponsorship deals. Many of these customers wanted third-party measurement solutions and, as a result, we invested heavily in this area. We have made good progress. We now have over 18 third-party measurement partners, and more than half of every dollar spent on our platform has third-party measurement attached to it.", "Here's an example of how our third-party measurement helped an advertiser achieve their business goals. 2K was looking to drive awareness and purchase intent of their NBA 2K18 video game using Snap Ads and Lenses. Through our partnership with Nielsen, they were able to measure the results that mattered most. Among users who were exposed to both the Snap Ads and Lenses, they achieved a 45-point lift in awareness and a 24-point lift in intent to purchase the game.", "Additionally, our acquisition of Placed represents our commitment to open-source attribution. Over 90% of retail transactions still happen offline in the physical world. Placed standardizes the omni-channel measurement of store visits and enables advertisers to understand performance that goes beyond a walled garden. It ensures that advertisers can understand performance in the context of their entire budget. In Q3 alone, Placed measured campaigns for more than 300 advertisers.", "The vast majority of businesses in the United States are small-to-medium sized, and don't have access to television advertising or Madison Avenue. With the launch of our self-service platform, we are investing heavily in expanding our existing advertiser base to include long-tail and mid-tail advertisers. We're seeing great traction. We more than tripled revenue from SMBs in the third quarter when compared to the first half of 2017. But to unlock the true potential of this segment, we need to invest in first-party measurement solutions.", "As such, we've recently begun to roll out additional attribution capabilities. In Q3, we began a small alpha of Snap Pixel, our conversion SDK, with a handful of advertisers. Snap Pixel allows advertisers of all sizes to track the impact that Snap Ads have on online sales, lead generation, or other conversion actions in real-time. This is particularly important for the mid-market and SMB advertisers. Additionally, the Pixel will soon support the targeting of custom audiences based on on-site behavior and bidding based on conversions, not just impressions or swipes.", "One of our first advertisers to test Snap Pixel was TechStyle, the parent company to Fabletics, JustFab and ShoeDazzle. They focused on two KPIs, cost per sign up and cost per purchase. It's early, but the results are promising. Across all their brands, they saw a cost per purchase that was about 40% to 60% lower than their goal within 24 hours after someone saw their ad. The retailers also achieved a cost per sign up that was roughly 30% to 50% lower than their goal. They were able to attribute 28% more conversions from their Snapchat ads by looking at one day's worth of view-through attribution.", "The third area of focus is democratizing our Sponsored Creative Tools. Over 60% of our daily active users create Snaps with our camera every day. Sponsored Creative Tools, which includes Lenses and Filters, allow advertisers to leverage this unique creativity to reach their audiences. Until recently, our Sponsored Lens product has been accessible primarily to larger advertisers looking to maximize reach. Based on comScore Xmedia, the average audience of the top primetime shows is between 5 million to 12 million viewers.", "A National Lens on Snapchat can reach well over 20 million users in one day. Because the user experience remains our top priority, we have limited Sponsored Lenses at one per day. This was the right decision as we refined the ad product, but it also impacted our ability to scale. We addressed this in the second quarter with the launch of Audience Lenses. Audience Lenses enable advertisers to purchase Sponsored Lenses that reach specific audiences, at a better entry price point. Advertisers can use the same targeting capabilities that they already use for Snap Ads, including age, gender, geography, and custom audiences. We're confident that this will help reduce seasonality and globalize our creative tools business. In fact, the number of lenses sold in Q3 was up nearly 15% from the last quarter and more than double the amount sold in Q3 of last year.", "Let's look at an example. Adidas wanted to target high school and college athletes for their \"Here to Create\" campaign. They used custom audiences to reach this particular demo and now with Audience Lenses, we're able to do this across all of our products. This allowed them to amplify their message to the most relevant audience, and results were fantastic. They saw an 18% increase in new visitation to their retail stores. We recognize the areas we need to invest in and we are acting quickly. Much of the work that we've done this year is laying the groundwork for 2018 and beyond, but we are encouraged by what we have seen so far.", "Thank you everyone for the time, and now I'll pass it to Drew to discuss our financial highlights for the quarter.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. Snap continues to make solid progress against its long-term goals, and the growing traction across many areas of our business is encouraging. Let me speak to the third quarter highlights.", "First, both Snap Ads and Creative Tools remain a strong one-two combination. Revenue from both product lines increased sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw more growth in engagement in the quarter. Metrics such as time on the app, video views and frequency of use all grew in Q3. We made meaningful progress building out our auction platform. Numerically, over 80% of Snap Ad impressions were delivered via the auction, up from 60% in Q2.", "Overall, Snap Ad impressions grew substantially. Snap Ad impressions increased over 60% sequentially and over 400% year-over-year. This means that we were able to grow ad impressions and engagement simultaneously, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of our business. As Imran mentioned, the auction transition continued to impact Snap Ad pricing in the quarter. In Q3, Snap ad pricing was down more than 20% sequentially and over 60% year-over-year, most of which was driven by the mix shift from reserved inventory at rate card prices to the unreserved auction.", "On a positive note, we were able to partially offset pricing declines with auction contestation. During Q3, we saw that auctions with multiple bidders resulted in prices that were over 40% higher than uncontested auctions. Furthermore, prices for ads that were contested grew sequentially in the quarter.", "On the cost side, our gross margins continue to scale well. We are seeing clear leverage in hosting and revenue share expenses, which is driving continued gross margin expansion. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Gross margins grew to 21%, up 230 basis points sequentially and over 2,000 basis points versus a year ago. Hosting costs per user have risen from $0.64 a year ago to $0.68 in the quarter, only a 7% increase over the last 12 months. We have seen revenues and engagement grow at much faster rates, creating cost leverage. We have excellent traction on some of our hosting cost initiatives and are benefitting from the dual cloud hosting environment.", "Similarly, as expected, we continued to see leverage on partner rev share expenses, driven primarily by monetizing My Story. Revenue share expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 10%, down 300 basis points sequentially and 500 basis points year-over-year. Geographically, North America remains a leading region for ARPU and gross margins. In the third quarter, North American ARPU was $2.17, which is 7 times higher than the rest-of-the-world, but is still well below our peer set. Periodically, we analyze our hosting costs by region, which considers factors such as regional differences in app usage and varied regional hosting rates. This internal analysis estimated that our North American gross margin was already over 50% in Q3.", "Switching gears, operating expenses were thoughtfully managed. In the quarter, costs decreased 2% sequentially to $223.1 million. We continue to manage back of house expenses closely, and corporate G&A fell $8 million, driven by lower employee expenses and reduced legal costs. We also benefitted from the timing of certain expenses including lower trade show costs. The annualized cost per employee was slightly over $300,000 which compares favorably to our peer set. This is down versus prior periods.", "Let me provide a brief update on a few of the investments Snap has made. One of Snap's biggest investments has been in our team. We have over invested early to achieve the scale necessary to compete globally. At the end of Q3, we had nearly 3,000 employees, 80% of which are in the front of house. In the quarter, we added almost 250 people organically, consistent with our expectations. Additionally, we added nearly 100 people with the Placed acquisition.", "Capital investments in the quarter were modest again at $26 million. Total CapeEx per user was what we believe to be an industry leading $0.15. For M&A investments, we completed the Placed acquisition in the quarter, which is off to a good start. Total consideration was $139.6 million. Unfortunately, we misjudged strong early demand for Spectacles and purchased more inventory than we now anticipate being able to sell. As a result, we recorded a $39.9 million non-recurring expense primarily related to excess inventory and purchase commitment cancellations. Moving forward, we will continue to be in the market place with Spectacles and expect modest revenue from the product line.", "We remain in a strong cash position, and ended Q3 with $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Capital deployment priorities remain business operations first, followed by opportunistic M&A. Since the IPO, we have been net settling employee shares for tax purposes. In Q3, we used $162 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations. Moving forward, we are planning a transition to sell shares on the open market on behalf of employees for tax purposes. As of September 30, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1,202 million and 1,441 million on a fully diluted basis.", "As we move forward, we want to share thoughts on the short-term. We will continue to scale the auction business. We plan to continue the transition of reserved impressions to the auction, and we exited the third quarter with higher than the Q3 average of 80% flowing through our auction platform. As a result, we are planning to see similar auction dynamics to Q3; specifically, gains in impressions and lower prices. We look forward to completing the transition of our Snap Ad business to the self-service and auction platform.", "On hosting expenses, we ended the quarter with slightly higher costs per user than the quarter average of $0.68. Historically, we have seen hosting costs increase during the fourth quarter due to the higher usage over the holiday season. We have seen a similar trend in operating expenses. Historically, our operating costs per head have increased low double digits from Q3 to Q4. As the team continues to settle in, we expect gains in employee productivity to be meaningful. This should allow us to reduce the scope and pace of hiring. Priorities for hiring will continue to be in engineering and international functions. Given this, we expect the pace of hiring to slow in the short-term, particularly in the seasonally slow fourth quarter.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q3 expense was $225.6 million. In the short term, we believe this is a good proxy for future quarters. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator who will open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "That concludes the prepared remarks for today's earnings call and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Imran in order for the auctions to continue to be highly contested it seems like you have to give advertisers ongoing reasons to pay more because that is presumably more highly targeted and has higher ROI. So sounds like you are just starting to ramp up attribution tools. So anyway to characterize, what percentage of your typical advertiser's budgets are being spent on more highly targeted basis? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think a couple of things need to happen for auction density to grow. First off is onboarding lot more advertisers and I think remember we launched our self-service platform in Q2 and we are pretty excited with the progress we made. We talked about it, we saw albeit increased the number of advertisers on our platform and we continue to invest heavily on inside sales team reaching out to small marketers and onboarding them to more and more advertisers on the platform. At the same time in terms of targeting, we actually made pretty significant investments over the last 12 months to help people reach the right -- show the right ad to the right audience, because when we show the right ad to the right audience it actually attracts more significant value for our users, for more advertisers and I think we made pretty good progress on that. On the first query attributions side, Pixel is out. I think we are going to continue to push it forward and I think that will drive advertisers to even more visibility in terms of what kind of ROI they have generated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, this is [indiscernible] for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of your programmatic advertising business, what are your views on opening up the Snap platform to third-party [DSPs] or exchanges to add incremental demand? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think right now we think the best way to drive our business to have the self-service platform where advertisers can reach directly rather than the DSP. We have an incredible audience base and we are very, very excited that audience and understanding about the audience, I think when you open up the DSP platform and things like that there is always a risk that information leakage out of your platform and that's not optimal. So I think we like our strategy of having self-service platform where our advertisers and agencies can come and reach the audience they want to reach and delivering the most right ad to the right person.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks. One for Imran and Drew and I guess one for Evan if I can. First, you guys talked about the pricing declines with the shift to programmatic as a headwind to revenue which seems obvious on a pricing impact. But are you really seeing budget pressure from this and specifically can you talk about what clients generally do with budgets when they shift to programmatic? Are they buying a consistent volume of impressions and tweaking budgets or just re-investing to get more volume such that it isn't really that much of a headwind to revenue? Any color you can share there would be great. And then a strategic one for Evan; seems like a lot of changes focusing on user growth, focusing on the creator communities. So just wondering, you know, if you can elaborate a bit how you guys had come around and how you get comfortable really as [this month] disrupt the [close friend] engagement that you guys have historically been so focused on?", "Imran Khan", "I think in terms of our advertiser adoptions, you have seen that roughly 400% growth in ad impressions on our platform on a year-over-year basis. So we are very pleased with the number of ad impression growing on our platform. And I think as Evan pointed out in his quick dispatch the significant impression growth we saw engagement on our platform grow on a year-over-year basis. I think one of the key thing also is self-service, allowing us to do is bringing a lot more advertisers on our user advertising platform. We really didn't get big dollar from the direct response advertiser, or performance marketers and lot of mix site advertisers. And by opening up the self-service platform we are bringing them on the platform. I want to share an example of our small advertisers who are not a bit necessarily are performance advertisers would not be successful on our platform if it was [indiscernible]. So GOAT, which is an online marketplace for buying and selling sneakers on mobile, they used our platform to drive app install and they were able to drive LTV, life time value, 20% above their goal and improved product period by a month compared to other marketing channels. So this is a type of example that by opening up the platform we were able to access advertisers who would not be there in the past successful on our platform and they can spend more money and drive their goals.", "Evan Spiegel", "You are right to point out that this communication between close friend is really valuable to our business and it remains the most important thing for Snap. So I think the really exciting thing about the redesign coming is that we have found a way to preserve and I think in many ways enhanced that friend communication while still providing more opportunities to provide distribution and monetization opportunities to contact vendors. And so I think you wish we were [inside] the roll out, but you are right that our focus here really is preserving that frequency and intimacy of communication between close friends.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler", "Hi, guys. Two questions. As in first on the user base, you called out that September was a big month for Android, added more net adds than iOS. So do you expect this to potentially accelerate going forward? And you talked about how you are working to simplify the app, is that happening right now or is that something that could happen in the future? And then Imran, on the self-serve platform, can you just talk about the behavior that some of these new advertisers were signing up in self-serve for the first time, what is the behavior? Are they ramping up their spend each week? Are they coming in and spending and then dropping off? Just any general color on the behavior of self-serve that will be great. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So given the distribution of Android devices in the world I would expect that over time we will see more net adds coming from Android which is why we focus so much on improving the Android experience and why we are re-building the Android application from the ground up to -- to make it easier to use. And right now, we are using a new version of the application internally and having a lot of fun with it, so excited to roll that out.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think Ross, with regards to your question, previously before the self-service platform if an advertiser wants to buy an advertisement they had to commit a significant chunk of dollars, in many cases couple of hundred thousand dollars and that's really difficult for many, many advertisers to come invest on a -- right on the new platform. With the self-service we saw that many advertisers are coming in on our platform and they are testing and as they are seeing success they are increasing their budget. I think one of the key thing we have seen that our performance advertising dollar or [DR] dollar has grown significantly. Also I talked about in the call that revenue from our small and medium sized businesses has tripled. So we are seeing great traction with that as more advertisers are coming and testing and learning and invest more.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead.", "Brian White", "Yeah. Evan you mentioned they are the priority in 2018 and I'm wondering you put a pretty cool world lens out there, Stranger Things with Netflix and I'm wondering how that innovation was received? And also how you are thinking about leveraging the True Depth Camera system on the iPhone X. I know Craig Federighi did a demonstration at the Apple event of September 12th, and did he shout out for Snap? So if you could just expand on that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. Thanks, Brian. You know I wish I had more data for you around the Stranger Things launch, because I agree that was super cool. I am more excited to see more and more advertisers experimenting with those products. I think they are creating really unique experiences for communities. So that's a win-win for us when our community really loves something that an advertiser is creating and spending a lot of time interacting with it. And as for the Apple innovation, very exciting to see, I think early days for Apple and their investments around AR. But the True Depth Camera obviously is ready for Snap and for the special -- on the front facing camera those lenses I think are enhanced by that building block that they provide.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "John Blackledge", "Thanks. Two questions, on the app redesign. If you can give us a sense of the timing, any more insight into the changes and why you think the redesign could be disruptive in the near term? And then on the user side distribution the redesign and the new Android app, how should we think about user growth in the near term?", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't have any timing to share with you today. So we will I guess look forward to surprising you with the redesign. But I think conceptually we have been spending a lot of our time sort of studying the evolution of content feeds on mobile and so if we kind of go back to the beginning of content feeds, Twitter was really the first content feed on mobile and it was interest based. So you would follow things you were interested in or news organization or celebrities and obviously the next evolution in that content feed. I would say for us invention of content feed based on content created by your friends and this was a very interesting innovation because it obviously personalized the content feed based on what your friends thought you would be interested in. and I think there is a really exciting opportunity here for another evolution about that content feed that addresses some of the short comings of the friend based content feed model. So for example on a friend based content feed, in order to get more content in that feed you need more friends and when people start adding more friends they then see a lot less comfortable posting content and so they start posting less. And that means that you need even more friends to get more content. And so you end up in this kind of precarious situation where because you based the content feed on what friends are posting you are sort of inherently limited in how you grow that collection of content. And ultimately what we found is that the best predictor of what people are interested in and want to watch is actually what they are watching, right. And I think there's an opportunity here for us to create a really great personalized content service that doesn't at all diminish the grades and I think very differentiated communications business that we have established.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Hello, Justin your line is live, you may proceed with your question.", "Justin Post", "Sorry about that, I was on mute. My question is really the mix of time on the site. Clearly Snaps are up 40%, any change in that mix? And then could you talk a little bit about the monetization of Snaps, how that compares versus many of the discovered kind of stories, how do you think about that? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So we don't break out the mix of time on the service. Overall time spent has been growing which is something that we are really excited about and so hopefully can share more with you in the future around that. I think it is a great opportunity to talk a little bit about our creative tools, like we talked about earlier around lenses, because those are a really fantastic way that we monetize our communication service. And so not only are we able to monetize the consumption side of the business around stories but also our creative tools like Geofilters and Lenses that has proven to be an expected way as Imran shared to drive much traction around our communications products.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think one of the key things to point out on Lenses and filters, I talked about in the call how we saw that because of audience in those lenses we saw 15% growth in the number of lenses sold on our platform in Q3 and doubled year-over-year. The other thing is these are very interesting product and completely differentiated product, for a longest period of time advertisers are trying to figure out how can they be part of the consumer conversations without being intrusive. Out lenses product and filters product actually give the advertisers the ability to be a part of the consumer conversation and in a very premium fashion. The other interesting thing is that the amount of time people are playing with those lenses product is actually pretty significant. In a world in mobile where the attention span is significantly lower, the play time on our lenses are actually very, very exciting to many, many advertisers and that's also driving the adoption. So I think we are actually very, very excited about both of our products [indiscernible] and our creative tools and we are using that as an opportunity to monetize those products long term.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks for taking my question. I wanted on advertising kind of a high level picture on the ad format. Ad performance really matters to driving ad budgets, you are talking about a redesign of the app. How do you think about the potential risk that a minute spent in stories format is just going to monetize materially lower than other social interaction like a news feed. Is that a risk because the way people consume stories and you are able to monetize that as high as other formats and if that's the case, should you be having news feed?", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't think we would add a news feed per se, but I definitely think there are ways to improve that performance on our service and we are always looking at evaluating that and as part of the redesign I do think there will be new monetization opportunities. Again too early to tell there, but we are excited about that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to hit on two things. First, you talked about the DAU trajectories through the 3Q and it kind of ended stronger in September. Just curious on those lines what you can tell us about Maps and how that's doing, didn't seem to get as much commentary tonight as it did three months ago? And then, secondly, just how that DAU trajectory is kind of early in 4Q? And then just on the advertiser side, could you help us understand when an advertiser would use the direct sales force going forward versus the auction format? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Just on Maps, we are very excited about how that product is progressing, we continue to really invest in this action emoji concept, which is very cool, because it allows people to express themselves without creating a snap. So as we look to empower self expression and remove the friction from self-expression sometimes people in the moment they don't necessarily want to create a snap and the Maps allows them to show that for example they are on a bike and listening to music [indiscernible] interactive around that behavior. So as far as the Maps is concerned very excited about it but still hidden behind a pinch dresser and we look forward to elevating the Maps in our product so that more people can find it easily. Obviously we are not going to provide guidance on DAU, but I think it is important to note, our audience may not be the largest today but we certainly feel that it's the most strategic. And very excited about the 70%, 13 to 34-year olds that we reach in the U.S., the U.K., France and Australia and I think that that is a really strong base to grow from because it's very easy to monetize and we will be able to fund our future growth in countries that maybe are harder to monetize in the short-term but that we believe will monetize in the longer term. So as I mentioned today, we are taking steps to change our product, and change our approach to grow outside of those key markets where we do think that there are future monetization opportunities. What we really want to make sure is that given the strategic nature of the 13 to 34 audience that was not yet -- that was really engaged with the Snap platform before we extended beyond our core.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think with regards to direct sales force versus auction, I think it's really important to understand that auction is a buying mechanism that lets our advertisers to come in and buy, test and learn either way their campaigns and see what drives better results. The value of our sales force remain incredibly high, primarily with the auction because the advertisers need to understand our platform and having insight what was on our platform, how to read on Snapchat, those kind of values that our sales force provide to our clients. So what we are saying is that as we make our buying platform more and more automotive, our sales force transition from taking orders to become more of a consultant for our clients to become partners. So that frees their time and they can focus more and more time solving client's business problem, because when you solve the client's business problem that drives really success. So I will share one quick example. So for example Activation, they wanted to test [shortfall] of ads on our platform, so it included this price in Snaps on our platform to work with our sales force and for their Call of Duty World War II title. And that was a 5 second cinemagraph ad, they worked with our creative strategy team and that drove 19 points lift in brand awareness, because our sales force had more time to work with the clients and give more insight and that really drove us to [indiscernible]. So I think that that's one of the -- another part example. So I think direct sales force has become enabler and become a consultant for our clients.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield", "My guess is from a really high level. It seems like you have only been public for you know eight or nine months, it seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time. I mean the auction seems to have surprised you, changing the apps making it easier for users. You are embracing [influencers]. Just when you look at the short period of time since the IPO where you seemed to be pretty upbeat, what's happened so fast -- what led to such a significant shift? And I guess maybe attached to that, is I guess for [every month], in the senior team you have assembled, not just on the call, but overall, is your senior team, the team really being a much bigger team or differently? And then just a housekeeping question on Spectacles, I think [indiscernible] comments about Spectacles were exceeding their expectation, yet today you are writing them off like three months of inventory. Just wondering, how you square exceeding expectations with the write-off will be helpful? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Rich. There has been a ton in change in a very short period of time and that's been the case over the life of the business in the last six years we have been in business. We continue to evolve the product very rapidly. We continue to evolve the business very rapidly and I guess we are just not afraid to make changes in the long term interest of the business. So I would expect that we continue learning as we grow the business and making changes that we think are in the best interests of growing the user base for revenue and ultimately providing our customers with a great product experience. As it relates to team dynamics, I am very happy with our executive team, but I am constantly evaluating our team, providing feedback and we are all working together to grow and trying to run the business in a productive way as possible. As it comes to Spectacles, you are right, we were very excited about Spectacles by the initial reception, because we were so excited we made I guess the wrong decision and we were balancing the trade off with [unit] economics of course that come with hardware. But ultimately we made the wrong decision based on the early traction and ordered a lot of long lead time products and ultimately we weren't able to sell as many Spectacles as we thought we had be able to based on our early adoption. So we are learning from it and we are kind of avoiding a similar mistake in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Jason Helfstein", "First, just about the brand advertisers, can you talk about how the annual budget cycle plays into it? It seems more and more budgets are being based on a calendar basis versus in the old days it was more of kind of on the school calendar. And kind of where you were at the beginning of this year, perhaps not in a position with measurements, some of the things that advertisers are demanding and kind of how that perhaps handicapped you this year but then how you stand going into next year as those budget decisions are being made? And then also how do you derisk the redesign of the apps and we know that your younger users are quite sensitive to the app that was originally designed for them? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think in terms of advertisers' upfront deals and things like that, look I think, one of the key thing is to drive more upfront deals, we have to drive value for our advertisers and as our business is growing we are able to show more and more value. We are able to show more and more products, more and more measurements, more and more targeting and also we are going to cover them for a long term. Usually I think one of the biggest complaints I heard from a lot of our agency customers, that hey, we don't hear from your team more often, because we didn't have a big team. Now I think the investment we made on the headcount helps us to cover them, to look at them and help them to really show what success could look like on Snapchat and how to win on Snapchat. And I think that's driving and we are having more and more conversation about upfront and I think having much more deeper conversation with the agencies on what we can do together. So I think we are making good progress. I am pretty pleased with it. And on top of that we are onboarding a lot more new advertisers we couldn't reach on our reserve platform, because now it's opened up the opportunity to reach out to the performance advertisers and small and medium sized businesses.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as it pertains to the redesign again we don't know exactly how that's going to play out, but we will be testing the product both internally, which is ongoing and externally and I think we are going to learn a lot from that. But fundamentally as we look at the product evolution at Snap, we really try to build products around the pieces and sometimes that means that there is an strong related option for a product. Like for example, our iconic storage products basically had no known use for the first six months or so. And so I think over time we have learned not to be fearful of making big product changes that we think are in the best interest of our community and we are going to keep going.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Thanks and I apologize if it's already been asked. But trying to get a better handle on the impact that the growing auction based ad platform is having and will have on financials that we all see every quarter. Can you give us a general sense of the difference in the prices in that market today relative to your direct sold business? And also what portion of the overall revenue is generated from it? And obviously since you are trying to get to -- where are we -- in this transitional period as it relates to the trade-off between pricing pressure and in growing your advertiser base? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks for the question. So at a high level, the auction is a strategic move for the company. It's something that's important for our business as we move forward and we think it's the right way for us to be growing long-term and regarding our reach. The dynamics that we saw in the third quarter with the auction are consistent with what we saw in the second quarter and that is growth in revenue on the auctions platform driven by significant increases in impressions. So we saw impressions up 400% year-over-year and up over 60% sequentially. So that impression growth is real. On the flip side we did see that we moved from sort of a rate card pricing model to an auction-based model, we did see pressure in pricing. Sequentially prices were down 20% of the quarter and 60% year-over-year. So that was real. We did see -- well we see contestation and we see bidders -- multiple bidders for that same advertising space we get the prices that were 40% higher than places where we didn't have a contested auction. So that really bodes well for the future. Obviously one of our key strategies here is to really grow the competition within the auction and then have more advertisers using the platform that does bode well for where we are. So that's the auction platform, it's really the centerpiece of our Snap Ad business as migrate there. We were -- 60% of our ads were sold on that platform in the second quarter, it's now over 80% and as I talked about our commentary in the fourth-quarter it's going to be important as that transition continues. As we plan our business we are thinking about that transition continuing and we continue to see a bump in -- we are continuing to see a bump in impressions and there is continued pressure on pricing. So that's Snap to Snap Ads that is at a high-level. We also have that good one-two punch with creative tools, the create tool business is a good business for us and we made progress there as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks. I have one for Drew and one for Evan. Following the answer to Mark's question can you draw down a bit on your high level view of the auction? Can you give [indiscernible] the rule of 80-20, so if 80% of the impressions were sold [dramatically], was it equal to in terms of advertising revenues as opposed to [indiscernible] revenues?", "Drew Vollero", "So at a high level the auction is a growing piece of our business. We haven't broken out the differences between Snap Ads and creative tools. I think we have talked about a good solid one-two punch, so both of them are important pieces of revenue. So that based on that you can get to like where you need to get to. If the majority of Snap Ads business right now is sold through the auction, more than 80% from an impression base, yeah its [sold] there. So it's an important and growing piece of our business, but in terms of quantifying the actual amount we are not going to do that.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Youssef Squali", "Thank you. Two questions, one for Imran and maybe one for Evan. Imran remind us again that for the budget timing of the launch of the programmatic platform was it Q4 of last year? Just trying to figure out exactly when do we lap that launch and when do we start having that maybe stop being a headwind. And then Evan you launched Context web -- I am sorry, Context Cards last quarter, can you speak to early learnings there and how this may help you leverage partners to provide users with more information and especially ability to trend that? Maybe if you can address that that will be great. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you for the questions. So with regards to timing, our API was the first partnership -- was the first initiative to start the business programmatically. That was launched in October of last year and then we expanded our API partnership in Q1 and then in late Q2 we launched our self-service platform. To give you a better sense as you are trying to understand the impact of our -- of this auction business over time, in my prepared remarks I talked about it that how auction volume for Snap Ads business as a percentage of overall Snap Ads business was over 80% and that is up 3x from Q1 and up from 60% in Q2, just to give you some sense.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. And as it pertains to Context Cards, very [solid] about it, initially Context Cards are focused on places and I think one of the coolest parts about Context Cards is that they leverage the behavior that's certainly known across our ecosystem where people swipe up on things that they are interested in to take an action, whether that's an ad or content posted by their friends or content that they see in Maps. And so we are leveraging this sort of [one] behavior swiping up to get more and obviously today it's only really around places, but we are very close to expand that to learning more about all sorts of things and something we are going to continue to listen.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. We thank you for attending today's session and you may now disconnect."]}

With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagements and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2017 which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

During the first quarter, we focused our efforts primarily on the performance and quality of our Snapchat application and automation across our content products and advertising business. We're pleased with the early results from these performance and quality improvements, particularly on Android devices. These improvements helped drive a significant increase in engagement, with now over 3 billion Snaps created every day with our cameras, generating an increase in overall sessions and time spent.", "We were also able to more than double the number of net additional users coming from Android devices compared to last quarter. And Android users accounted for over 30% of net additional users this quarter, up from 20% last quarter. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're excited by the amount of progress we've made in such a short time.", "We averaged 166 million daily active users for the quarter. Worldwide net additional users in Q1 increased by 54% compared to Q4 as we continued to expand our community in North America and Europe. We also managed to make some headway in the rest of world, largely due to improvements on Android.", "Towards the end of the first quarter, we began to roll out our search product. Search is exciting for us because it begins to expose the so-called long tail of content on our service. With so many Snaps created every day, there really is a story for everything on Snapchat. Search surfaces interesting Stories created by machine learning and allows our community to find Stories for anything they might be interested in.", "We made significant progress in automating our advertising business this quarter, with more than 20% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically through our API. Automating our ads platform means that advertisers get better pricing, our community sees better ads and we're able to make more money per impression.", "Overall, I feel we have executed well on our priorities for this quarter, performance, quality and automation. Our progress this quarter should provide a strong foundation as we continue to build our business.", "With that, I will turn it over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We're very pleased with our Q1 achievements. We're really excited about the progress we have made increasing engagement across Snapchat. We believe that great advertising starts with strong user engagement. As Evan mentioned, time spent for our users continues to grow. On average, in Q1 our users spent over 30 minutes per day on Snapchat. This increase is largely because of the unique content on our platform.", "Snapchat offers exclusive content from several perspectives, friends and family, our global community and premium publishers. With user Stories, Snapchatters see the world through the eyes of their friends and family. Our community creates and sends billions of Snaps every day as a fun and easy way to communicate and stay up to date with their closest friends.", "With our Stories, Snapchatters stay informed and connected to the world around them. This past quarter, we told over 450 Our Stories in over eight languages to our global community. Our expert teams curate Snaps submitted by Snapchatters around the world's biggest moments, such as breaking news, entertainment and sports.", "In February, Our Story coverage of the Oscars received over 250,000 submissions from Snapchatters. This allowed us to curate multi-perspective stories full of unique content that is exclusive to our platform. Over 21 million global unique viewers tuned in to watch our Oscars coverage, indicating to us that the power of these stories is resonating with our community.", "With publisher's Stories, Snapchatters engage with premium content curated by some of the most credible media companies in the world. We expanded our offerings in Q1 by launching nine new partners in the U.S. and one in Norway. This brings us to a total of 55 global partners as of Q1 2017.", "We work with Nielsen on custom analysis on Snapchat's unique daily reach in the U.S., when Nielsen found that 45% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are reached by Snapchat on any given day.

Our platform allows us to engage an audience that research shows is difficult to reach. We believe that the ability to deliver this type of reach and engagement is the cornerstone of a great advertising business.", "Now I would like to share some of the progress we have made to benefit advertisers in three key areas, one, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and, three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. We started our advertising business by servicing big brands. This strategy proved invaluable. These partners have high standards and provided great feedback that shaped our priorities. Universal Pictures was our first advertiser in the fall of 2014. Since then, they have challenged us to find unique and effective ways to reach the right audience for each campaign. We have been a go-to partner for nearly every single title, helping them across a variety of objectives. From 2015 to 2016, Universal more than doubled their spend with us which we feel is a testament to the returns they have seen on their early investment.", "And we continue to listen and develop new solutions to serve our advertisers. By listening to our partners, we learned that advertisers are hungry for more effective direct response advertising solutions. This meant enhancing our Snap Ad brand's experience with interactive capabilities which we call Snap Ads with Attachments. Attachments help advertisers accomplish specific goals by providing a way for users to engage with a Snap Ad.", "For example, a user who watches a Snap Ad for a new Hollywood movie can swipe up to view the full trailer or buy a ticket, all without leaving Snapchat. I would like to share a couple of examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments are driving value for our performance advertisers.", "Acorns, a micro investing app, partnered with us on an app install campaign to drive both brand awareness and app installs. With this campaign we delivered a 300% increase in app installs. Fullscreen also continues to partner with us on various direct response initiatives. They consistently see higher active viewing rates from users who come in via Snap Ads compared to other platforms. And each time we collaborate together, they continue to see lower costs per acquisition.", "We have designed our ad products to work well on their own or when used together in integrated campaigns. We have many advertisers that now leverage Snapchat with an always-on strategy.", "Throughout Q1, Snapchat was a strategic mobile partner to Anheuser-Busch's core brands, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra and Busch. Anheuser-Busch leveraged Snapchat as an always-on video partner, utilizing all of our ad products for a variety of initiatives. This included sports partnership like NFL, MLB and NASCAR, as well as holidays and tent-poles, like St. Patrick's Day.", "L'Oreal U.S.A is another great example. They have made us an always-on part of their strategy, augmenting Lens and Geofilter executions with Snap Ads. L'Oreal U.S.A has taken advantage of Snapchat's premium, contextually relevant publisher content in combination with advanced targeting in user Stories, to keep their brands top of mind with customers.", "The second area we have focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We want to make it easy and painless for both the largest brands and the smallest local businesses to advertise on Snapchat. This includes how advertisers buy, create and manage their ads. We're still in the early stages of building these tools and we're making good progress.", "In Q1 2016, we launched our on-demand Geofilters tool or ODG. To date we have tens of thousands of advertisers creating and managing their own geofiltered campaigns. This past quarter, we launched line of credit for ODG to make it even easier for all advertisers to buy ads.", "Our most significant step was with the launch of our API and auction in Q4 of last year. We have been working hard to scale our auction to make it something valuable to advertisers of all sizes. Today, our API is live in 24 countries and serving some of the world's largest brands in addition to small and medium-sized businesses.", "Last week we announced our first Snap Ads self-service product, called Snapchat Ad Manager. Our goal is to put the power of our ad products into the hands of every advertiser, regardless of their size. This tool supports all of our ad products, targeting capabilities; and goal-based auction solutions which allows advertisers to bid for swipes or bid for app installs.", "The third area of focus is proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Delivering metrics and proving ROI to advertisers has been a massive area of progress over the past 12 months. Today we have 13 different third-party measurement partners and this list will continue to grow. We also invested heavily in Snap to Store, our own first-of-its-kind measurement offering. Snap to Store allows advertisers to measure foot traffic and demographics for Snapchatters after they see ads on our platform. These kind of location-based online to off-line measurement is a strength for Snapchat and in many ways a Holy Grail of ad measurement.", "During the 2016 holiday season, Hollister ran a Snap Ads campaign. And within seven days of seeing the ad, Snap to Store found that over 63,000 incremental Snapchatters visited a Hollister store nationally.", "Overall, we're excited about the progress we have made as we scale our advertising business. We have a lot of work to do in the rest of 2017 and look for -- to what's ahead.", "Thanks, everyone, for the time. And now I will hand it over to Drew.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Growth in new users, engagement and year-over-year revenues highlighted our first quarter results. Revenues grew 286% year-over-year to $149.6 million, driven primarily by strong advertiser demand. Revenues in North America were $128.7 million in the first quarter, up 259% year-over-year. In Europe, revenues were $13.1 million, up 385% year-over-year. Rest of world revenues were $7.8 million, up from only a couple hundred thousand dollars, a year ago.", "Sequentially, first quarter revenues were down 10% compared to Q4 2016. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the expected seasonality from advertising which comprises the bulk of our revenues.", "Snap sold revenue was $129 million, approximately 86% of total revenues. Partner sold revenue was $12.3 million and other revenues were $8.3 million, primarily driven by Spectacles. Total revenues outside North America for Q1 were 14% of sales, up from 7% of sales, a year ago. Average revenue per user or ARPU, was $0.90 in the first quarter, up from $0.32 a year ago but sequentially lower than Q4.", "We believe North America remains a leading indicator for the scale potential of our business. North American ARPU was $1.81, more than double our global average which was up 170% versus last year. Both Snap Ads and Creative Tools were meaningful revenue drivers for the business. New products like the API were also key revenue drivers in Q1.", "Now turning to expenses, we have two primary cost components, cost of revenue and operating expenses. Please note that when I discuss these expense figures, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of hosting costs and revenue share expenses. Operating expenses are driven by headcount costs. We utilize third parties to provide our infrastructure. This strategy has allowed us to focus on product innovation while we leverage their expertise, their capital and their operating efficiencies. We estimate this capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures to date, while delivering competitive daily costs to serve our users.", "In the quarter, we made good progress against our hosting costs in two key areas. First, we started to migrate to a dual cloud environment using both Google and Amazon to host our infrastructure. And second, we signed new contracts with each provider which lowered costs for most of our key services. As such, hosting expenses fell 12% in the quarter sequentially, down from $113 million to $99 million. These savings more than offset the increases we incurred from growing engagement.", "Relatedly, total cost of revenue fell sequentially $10.3 million or 6%, driven by those hosting savings, partially offset by revenue share expenses which grew slightly. Revenue share expenses increased by shifting the structure of certain revenue share contracts from variable to fixed fee arrangements which raised costs in the quarter but could create leverage as the year progresses and as revenues expand.", "As mentioned, cost of revenue is closely linked to our capital expenditures. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $18 million and were primarily spent on the expansion of our global office footprint. Capital expenditures were $20.4 million in Q4 2016, so Q1 expenses were down 12% sequentially.", "Operating expenses increased 18% sequentially to $196.2 million in the first quarter. We continue to invest in acquiring engineering talent and scaling our global operations. Expenses related to headcount were over 75% of total operating expenses in the quarter. We ended the quarter with 2,360 employees, up from 1,859 at the end of 2016.", "Our financial strategies for operating expenses are threefold, first, to continue to invest in engineering and sales; second, to leverage G&A expenses; and, third, to moderate overall cost growth per head. In the quarter, we made progress against all three goals. 90% of our new hires were in engineering and sales. Additionally, G&A expenses fell from 39% to 32% of total operating expenses. And third, operating expenses per head declined 7% sequentially. Our overall business remains in investment mode.", "Scale operations related to recruiting and facilities are incurred upfront while monetization occurs more gradually. As such, nominal losses increased in the quarter.", "GAAP net loss was $2.2 billion for the quarter which included the expected stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $2 billion as a result of our IPO. Stock-based compensation expense was significantly higher than prior periods due to two factors. First, the recognition of expenses related to RSUs for which the performance condition was triggered by the completion of our IPO in March. And second, an award granted to our CEO which we expensed in its entirety during the quarter.", "Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2017 RSUs at the end of Q1 is $1.3 billion, expected to be recognized over a period of slightly more than three years, of which about half of that expense we expect to recognize during the remainder of 2017. RSUs granted during 2017 will be an additional expense.", "Adjusted EBITDA loss was $188.2 million in Q1 2017, compared to a loss of $152.3 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $93.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total shares outstanding at the end of Q1 was 1,179 million and 1,432 million on a fully diluted basis.", "We remain in a strong cash position. Cash and marketable securities increased sequentially from $987.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily from the proceeds of our IPO in early March. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Product innovation and execution remain top priorities for 2017.", "I'll now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.", "Mark Mahaney", "Two sets of questions. Drew, would you care to comment at all about how to think about DAU growth near term through the balance of the year? And any commentary on when we could see peak EBITDA losses?", "And then, Evan, if you think about the product roadmap, are there particular areas you think that we as investors should focus on? I know you mentioned a couple of improvements you made to the Android platform. Other -- on the Apple side, are there particular new features that have been rolled out recently or are about to be rolled out that you think could be meaningful in terms of user and engagement growth? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. I'd love to speak a little bit to the DAU question, because it's a question that we get all the time. And I think one of the reasons why it's such a popular question is because there's a lot of this thing in our industry called growth hacking, where you send a lot of push notifications to users or you try to get them to do things that might be unnatural or something like that.", "And I think while that's the easy way to grow daily actives quickly, we don't think that those sorts of techniques are very sustainable over the long term. And I think that can ultimately impact our relationship with the customer.", "And so I can give an example where if we had just in the beginning encouraged Snapchatters to add all their friends in the contact book instead of just a few of them, they might feel really uncomfortable creating Snaps and adding them to their Story, because they wouldn't know who was actually watching.", "So, ultimately, I think the way that we try to help people understand how we think about daily active user growth is really through the lens of creativity and creation, because we built our entire business on creation.", "So one of the things I think we've talked about a lot is this idea that anytime someone creates a Snap, they typically either send it to their friend which brings that friend into the Snapchat ecosystem; or they add it to their Story which obviously contributes to time spent as they provide that content to all their friends.", "And so, I think the most important thing to understand is that really we think of this daily active user growth as a function or a derivative of the growth in creation. And so we're really excited about the momentum there.", "And then I think we also talked about two things that are really important to the growth of our service. The first is affordable cell service, broadband cell service and decent to high-end smartphones. So historically we've really focused our efforts on markets where both of those are available because we can really deliver value through our products that way. So I think we think, over time, as connectivity grows, that more people will be able to use our products and really get value from them.", "So the last thing I will say is that the way we talk about DAU growth in our Company really as it pertains to creativity is about removing friction from the creative process. So we've talked about Lenses which I think are a great product. And the reason why I think that that prompted such an explosion in creativity is because it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service, because people enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that.", "So another example we gave recently was the improvements to our Android product. And so I think the more we're able to reduce friction from the creative process by improving the way our camera works in terms of Creative Tools and also just functionality, more people will feel empowered to express themselves. And I think we believe that that translates to DAU growth.", "Drew Vollero", "Mark, as it relates to your question on guidance, whether it's DAUs or peak EBITDA losses, we're going to run the Company here for the long term. We want the flexibility to make the right decision in the long term. So we're not going to be short sighted about profit decisions to make a quarter or whatever that would end up being. So at this point, there is not going to be any financial guidance coming from Snap.", "Mark Mahaney", "Thank you, Evan. Thank you, Drew.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Evan, just one follow-up on the DAU and then one for either Imran or Drew. So it sounded like the Android activations are picking up. So I guess the question is, why isn't the rest of world region keeping pace with maybe the historical trend that you've seen in that geo or what you're seeing right now in North America and Europe, with around 3 million added each quarter?", "And then do you expect that to pick up at some point in the future? And any color -- you guys just launched the World Lenses product about a month ago, so any initial read on how that uptake has been going. And that I have one follow-up.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So I think the connectivity issue is a real problem in the developing world, because it really changes the use case of our service and the behavior of people that use Snapchat.", "So, for example, in certain developing world markets, people tend to use their Wi-Fi at home or in an Internet Cafe because the broadband cell service is so expensive. And what that means is that you can't use Snap to communicate in the moment. You have to go use Snap at a wireless Cafe. And that turns Snap into much more of a broadcast, lean back kind of service.", "And so I think we can invest in growing those sorts of products in those markets. But the way that our service works, I think, is by empowering this sort of visual communication. And that is just really tough if you don't have cell service wherever you go.", "Ross Sandler", "Got it, okay. And then the question for Imran or Drew is just on the revenue breakdown. The $150 million, can you just -- Drew, you mentioned that both the Creative Tools and Snap Ads were growing rapidly. Can you just give us a little sense on how much of that came from those two buckets and where we're today on ad load for discover?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think -- look, we built the best mobile ad product. I fundamentally believe that. If you look at our Snap Ad product, they are full screen; they play with sound. And if you look at our sponsored Creative Tools -- those are the Lenses and Filters -- people are actually putting it on their pictures and videos and sharing with their friends. So they are -- that actually has very superior ROI that we have seen with many, many advertisers. And both of those sponsored Creative Tools and our Snap Ads are contributing meaningful revenue. We're not breaking those down at this point.", "With regards to ad load, look, we're very, very early days. If you look at -- as Evan mentioned, we now have more than 3 billion Snaps get created on our platform. I talked about how we have our average users are spending 30 minutes -- more than 30 minutes on our platform. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of ad load.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "I have one for Evan and one for Imran, if I can. Evan, when you think about the creative process behind product development, how much of this focus is really on products for your core audience versus products perhaps for a more mass audience, including older demographics? Maybe you can give us a sense of what you're seeing from those folks in terms of today and what products might be in the pipeline that appeal more to older audiences.", "And then, Imran, wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of adoption around the self-service platform and in particular around direct response versus brand advertisers. Do you see evidence that the mix is increasingly shifting more to the DR side? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of the way we develop product, the important thing to understand is that we're always trying to do our best to build products that are universally appealing. So things like talking with pictures or telling Stories, those are the things that we really believe are universally appealing.", "Although we do tend to market our products directly to younger people because, frankly, they are more interested in learning how to use new technology products. And that's sort of -- is partly inspired by trying to teach my grandma how to use email; and she'd really prefer to just talk on the phone. So I think now a lot of grandparents are using email, but 20 years ago it was a little different.", "And so I think, over time, that strategy has worked for us. This quarter, the 25-plus demo, time spent in sessions are up and it continues to be a larger portion of our audience. So I really do believe we've done a good job delivering products with universal appeal, even if they are initially adopted by people who are excited about new ways to use cameras and communicate.", "Imran Khan", "Yes and with regards to self-service, our journey for self-service started in October of last year when we launched our API. Now we have 24 API partners. And in Q1, 20% of our Snap Ad impressions were served through the API platform. So that is pretty -- we're very pleased with that adoption within six months of launching the product.", "And the self-service, we announced last week that we make it available. We're very excited about the initial reaction and excitement about this product. It will be broadly available first week of June, so I think it's too early to comment about it.", "With regards to DR versus brand, I think we took a deliberate approach to start our business with the brand advertising. And the reason is we've listened -- we heard from our advertisers that there was not enough good solutions for brand advertising on the mobile. And a lot of the brand advertisers are also the very large advertisers and they have very high standards. So I think by proving the ROI to the large brand advertisers, we have been able to create a very good, strong, mobile app product on the marketplace.", "We have been making great progress on the DR side. In the call, I talked about the example of Acorn where they saw a 300% increase; or Fullscreen were testing very healthy customer acquisition costs. We're seeing more and more DR customers adopting our platform and seeing great result.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.", "Eric Sheridan", "Maybe two, both around long term strategy and shorter term, as well, on the hardware side. Evan, would love to get your sense of how you think about hardware that needs to be made by Snap itself versus leveraging, especially areas like AR and VR that we might see from third parties, sort of a follow-up on Mark's question from earlier. And then one around the financials. With the step-down in revenue quarter over quarter, Q1 over Q4, is there any way you could call out the impact that Spectacles might have had in that step-down, quarter over quarter? Thanks, guys.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of our hardware strategy, our approach when we're exploring new technology is to usually work on it ourselves. So if you remember back even when we started building Publisher Stories, we really created a lot of our own content. And that's usually the best way for us to explore something really, really quickly and really learn from it. And so that's been our strategy.", "Today with Spectacles, I think it's been really exciting to see people capture memories from their perspective. There's obviously something really exciting about that. Over, I guess, 5 million Snaps have been created with Spectacles to date. And so I think we're going to keep experimenting there. And then at some point obviously, I think as we've shown with our other products, we like being a good partner and I think that's always an interesting avenue to explore.", "Drew Vollero", "So, financially, Eric, on the Spectacles side again, we launched the Spectacles.com website during the quarter. It's a modest program for us right now. We report that in other revenue. We don't break out Spectacles, per se, but it was a little more than $8 million for the quarter.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "I had two; first one for Imran. Can you just talk about what kind of content you're looking for on the Snap platform and how you ensure that you get the discoverability of that video or content in what's becoming a more crowded discover tab?", "And then second, drew, just understanding that there's seasonality, of course, in 1Q in brand spending. You're also just very early in your trajectory. But is there anything else to think about here as we go through 2017, in terms of seasonal or other kinds of comp issues through the year? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I'd actually love to take this opportunity to talk a little more broadly about our content strategy in general. The simple answer to the discoverability problem for our publishers to date has been really the application of machine learning which has really helped us show the right content to the right person in terms of the Publisher Stories content.", "But I think more broadly, we have really three great types of content on our service. The first obviously, the user Stories product that we initially created where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and they don't feel like they're part of a popularity contest. And I think that product has been really terrific.", "And I think after that, obviously, we developed Publisher Stories. And Publisher Stories I think are really interesting because we were able to really create an ecosystem that works where publishers have an incremental audience where they can monetize their content; but also build a relationship with the customers that are viewing that content that we've seen also impact their business outside of the Snap ecosystem. And that relationship is really, really important to us. And we have a loyalty metric that we share with those partners because I think they've really been able to build a relationship on Snap.", "And then I think the last one that's really fun for us and is really a new one, are the new Stories that are being created in our search product. And that's really exciting because people all over the world are experiencing really fun things. And just by contributing their Snap to Our Story, we do all the hard work on the back end to basically collect all these perspectives together, compile them into interesting Stories that everyone can enjoy. So I think this is yet another type of relationship that's being built on Snap where people around the world are seeing things from new perspectives.", "So, I think, broadly speaking, the content strategy is working well. And then I think we have some other things we're interested in, in building on in the future.", "Drew Vollero", "On the second part of your question, obviously the business is scaling quite rapidly. We were up 286% year-over-year, if you look at the revenues. As you look at the back half of the year, obviously we're building an international business. We have a salesforce now that's really starting to get traction.", "There were a couple of the events in the back half of 2016 from a seasonal perspective. We did have the Olympics in the third quarter of 2016. That was a nice bump for us. And then in the fourth quarter, we have good partnerships with college football and the NFL on the sporting side. And so you can think about that a little bit. There also was a little bit of election upside, as well, in 2016.", "But, overall, the business is just in a very different place in terms of the resources and the size of the reach that we have right now with the salesforce.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two; the first one to Evan. There is very strong engagement and time spent on the platform, but the ad deceleration was pretty steep. You talked about removing friction in engagement. I'd be curious to hear about what are the main points of friction that you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars onto the platform? What excites you most to fix that over the next couple years? And then on discover, can you just talk about the type of engagement or user adoption you're seeing on discover and what are the main ways you can drive faster discover adoption? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, sure. I think the big issue with advertising over the next decade or so, frankly, is going to be education. I think we have world-class ad units. They are delivering ROI. We've done a lot of work this year to build out the measurement side of the business. And so I think now really it's an education process and I think early adopters are seeing great results. And so we've just got to keep showing people how Snap can really work for them and drive ROI.", "And then -- sorry. As far as the discover content is concerned, I think one of the things we're really excited about is our new Shows product. I don't know if you had a chance to see it, but basically it is total -- it is content created just for Snap. So rather than a lot of the video content you're seeing I think on mobile right now which is repurposed from TV or repurposed from the Internet, we've worked with some really outstanding partners to create some awesome shows.", "And I think right now, we have about one show a day. I think that will grow through the end of the year. And these are episodes like -- Second Chance, I think what was on today; and these are the types of shows that are drawing audiences over 8 million. So we're excited about that.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Imran, it seems like you have around 11 office locations right now around the globe. It seems like the vast majority of those are in the U.S., as well as the English-speaking countries. So, when can we start to see you guys start to go more aggressively after the other large ad markets in Continental Europe and elsewhere, so that we will start seeing the monetization gap between North America and Europe close? It seems like the users are catching up, but the revenue in Europe still seems to be about 1/10th of what you're reporting in North America right now. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're very pleased with our international growth. I think if you look at in Q1, 14% of our revenue came from international market. That is up from 7% a year ago. I think we're still early on with many market, like for example in Germany, we're just getting started. We're just getting started in Nordic markets and Netherlands and things like that. So I think as we continue to expand more sellers in those markets and continue to invest, I think you will see international continue to grow as a percentage of revenue.", "Stephen Ju", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.", "Ron Josey", "I just wanted to drill a little bit more into self-service, with 20% of ads delivered through the API in the first quarter and then the pending launch of the ads manager, can you just talk about the roadmap for self-service? The tools appear to be there with support across the ad formats and want to know if Lenses is included. And then how do you manage the channel conflict between Snap's salesforce and an ad manager? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think the -- first of all, 20% of Snap, that is what flowed through the API, not Lenses and Filters. And I think what we're really committed to that it is make it very easy for any advertisers to buy a Snapchat ad. And I think a lot of the large advertisers also want to use our self-service platform because they want to try out different creatives; they want to get more real-time result. And as well as a lot of small businesses who doesn't necessarily have access to sellers or agencies -- they also want to try it out.", "And I think what you will see us that over the next year or two and on an ongoing basis, is a continued investment to make it as frictionless as possible for everybody to buy ad on our platform.", "And with regards to channel conflict, the way we manage our channel conflict is the sellers have their clienteles and we got list that clienteles what platform and how they buy ads on the platform; they get credited towards that. So we have a pretty good -- we feel very good about the channel conflict management on that.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.", "Scott Devitt", "I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about geographic mix in terms of user growth. North America and Europe continue to outperform rest of world in terms of absolute DAU adds and how to think about that throughout 2017 and future years. And then secondly, just a clarification on the Spectacles revenue that Eric asked about earlier. Could you give the number of -- for Spectacles in 4Q? And then also in 1Q just to make sure -- understood what that $8 million was -- which quarter that was in. Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Yes, on the Spectacles side, just as a quick clarification, other revenue in the fourth quarter was I think a little bit more than $4.5 million. And so the numbers I gave earlier to Eric were first quarter other revenues were a little bit more than $8 million. So that will give you a little context. And really the program began in the fourth quarter.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as far as DAU growth, we're going to continue to focus on North America and Europe where we think we can deliver the most value for customers, based on their devices and the network. And longer term, obviously, we really believe that Snapchat is for everyone. And it's just early days for us, so we're focused in North America and Europe first.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge", "Two questions. Evan, in terms of the upcoming product roadmap, could you maybe discuss what you're excited about and perhaps how you see the cadence of product innovations progressing throughout the course of the year?", "And then maybe for Imran, you mentioned Universal doubled ad spend, 2016 versus 2015. Just your thoughts on ad demand in the U.S. in 1Q -- were you pleased with it? And then how is ad demand trending, thus far in 2Q? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "So I think at this point, we're kind of famous for not giving guidance on the product pipeline. But we're obviously really excited about it and we love surprising our community; so should be a fun rest of the year.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to ad business in Q1, I was very pleased with our Q1 ad performance. And I think, as you know, that our business has more focus on brand advertisings. That's how we got started and the brand business is very seasonal. But if by that on a year-over-year basis our business grew 286% on a year-over-year basis.", "And we continue to invest in both DR and brand and continue to make the advertising business as frictionless as possible which will help us to onboard many, many advertisers on the platform which should bode well for our future advertising business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "On the DAU number, can you unpack for us a little bit? A DAU, daily active user, is obviously an incredibly high bar. Can you unpack for us a little bit how much of the growth came from adding additional users to the platform versus engaging -- increasing engagement on the platform? And then from an advertising perspective, was there any impact to the quarter from changes in the sales organization or any sort of disruption there that you felt like would have allowed the Company to potentially grow advertising faster, had you seen more stability in the quarter?", "Imran Khan", "Look, I'm not sure what sales organization change you are mentioning; but I think we continue to grow our sales organization and continue to add a lot more people in the organization. And that continues to do very well. I think we're very fortunate to hire a lot of great talent in the organization throughout the quarter. And I think the salesforce is -- remained really very focused. And I'm very pleased with the execution we're doing. Evan, do you want to take DAU?", "Evan Spiegel", "I think we talk a lot about DAU as an engagement metric. Obviously we provided a couple extra metrics this quarter, like time spent which is over 30 minutes. And obviously an overall increase in sessions on a per user basis, so those are things we're excited about. And as I mentioned, I think the more that we can remove friction from this creative process, the more people want to use our service. And that's our strategy.", "Heath Terry", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Mark Zuckerberg opened up F8 essentially saying that they are now a camera company with an augmented reality API designed to let the whole world in and innovate. And while he didn't ever say it directly, it really sounded like he wants to bury Snapchat. So, I think the question that's on every investor's mind is does Facebook scare you, why or why not? And then I have a follow-up for Imran.", "Evan Spiegel", "Look, I think if there's one thing that I'd want to communicate today, it's probably just the overall importance of creativity to our business. And I mean this from every perspective, from the team that we hire to how they work together; the creative culture that we have; the products that we have that inspire people to create. And I think our overall strategy, obviously which is to deliver value through creativity. And I think the bottom line is, like, if you want to be a creative company you've got to get comfortable with and basically enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your products if you make great stuff.", "And I think we've seen this happen a lot in technology. When Google came along, everyone really felt like they needed a search strategy. When Facebook came along, everyone felt they needed a social strategy. And now I think with Snap, with our company, we believe that everyone is going to develop a camera strategy. Because I think we really help people understand how valuable the camera is, because it's really the center of everything that we do. And I think, at the end of the day, just because Yahoo, for example, has a search box, it doesn't mean they are Google.", "Richard Greenfield", "So just to follow up on the advertising side, either for you, Evan or for Imran. Why should an advertiser, just given the magnitude of the scale of Facebook versus Snapchat -- not to mention the advertising tools -- why advertise on Snapchat versus just dumping more money into Facebook?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, I think a bunch of reasons. Number one, we have incremental audience that we talked about. Number two, we're created -- I would argue that probably the best mobile ad product on the marketplace which is what many, many, many of our advertisers are seeing, superior ROI.", "Third, I think, fundamentally, advertisers want to advertise in many different platforms so that they can reach the -- advertise at different context. And fourth, we also have a very difficult to reach audience and a very, very engaged audience, as we talked about in my prepared remarks. All advertising starts with a strong engagement and we provide incredibly strong engagements. An average user is spending more than 30 minutes on the platform. So all of those reasons I think is very, very attractive to advertisers to be on our platform.", "Richard Greenfield", "Thank you for the answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "Just a DAU question again. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on the month-to-month trends, how you exited the quarter and early Q2. And maybe just remind us a little bit of the seasonality of your user growth and user engagement.", "And then in terms of host costs per DAU, I was under the impression those were largely a function of engagement. But you said that that wasn't necessarily the case in Q1. You talked about some savings from what you're doing on the partner and side. Should we expect that those kind of savings to continue at least for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, in terms of guidance, we don't want to give intra quarter guidance. As you know that advertising business is a seasonally -- seasonal business, where Q1 is seasonally weaker. And so our business will continue to face seasonality that we see on the broader advertising market. With regards to -- I think one of the things I keep want to highlight that I have been feeling very strongly about our ad business. Again, I think in addition to the ROI we're driving for advertisers, we're also providing a lot of powerful location data. So people Snapchat as a messaging app and people open the app many times. You see a lot incredible amount of location data and that's also very, very valuable. That's also driving a very strong ROI for everything -- in addition to everything I just talked about.", "So we feel very good about our advertising business. And beyond that, I can't really comment specific to the quarter.", "Mark May", "I was talking about the DAU seasonality, how to think about that in Q2 and seasonality combined with how you exited the quarter DAU. Seasonality.", "Imran Khan", "Again, I think if you look at our business, our user growth was driven by innovation. And as we continue to improve the performance and quality, that also driving the DAU growth. And I think in terms of beyond that, I don't think we should think too much about seasonality on that.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to cost of revenue and your question, cost of revenue was $141 million in the quarter. $99 million of it is hosting costs. Another $23 million is revenue share, so those really are the two primary components of what drive it.", "Hosting costs are paid directly to our third-party infrastructure providers. We have primary business with Google and we've also brought Amazon over as well recently. There are a series of headwinds and tailwinds in that business. Growing engagement, to your point and new users cost us more because they are variable cost contracts. The more that consumers use our app -- the more that they open it, the more that they Snap on in, they more they download content, the more that we incur charges.", "So in terms of the prices that we pay for those services, because we signed two new contracts, we got lower prices with both of those providers. And so that provided a significant tailwind for us. And it really was the upside that you saw in sequential costs. Our costs went from $113 million last quarter to $99 million there. And that is in a quarter where we saw significant growth in engagement in some of the main attributes as well as we saw the user growth. You can see we added another 8 million users in the quarter.", "So it really was that offset in pricing that we got from the two contract providers that really drove hosting costs lower. And revenue share is a piece of that. Revenue share was up slightly in the quarter. We had restructured a couple of deals. They are now more fixed-fee deals as opposed to percentage of revenue deals. Those will give us leverage if we're able to grow sales in the back half of the year; but, in the short term, raised our expenses in the first quarter.", "Mark May", "And I guess my question is as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, are you -- is host costs going to more than closely align with DAU and engagement growth? Or some of these cost savings from the new contract is going to continue to be a tailwind for the next couple of quarters?", "Drew Vollero", "The contractual pricing is, going forward, we signed a five-year deal with each of the companies, so it's new pricing that goes forward from this point. As it relates to where it all comes out, as I said, there is a series of headwinds and tailwinds. It really is a function, first and foremost, about engagement and how much engagement happens on the site and how many users that we add. Those really are what drive the costs. In terms of the year-over-year changes in the contract, the contract does have lower prices for our key services as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "A couple questions. Get a lot of questions on competition, so wondering if you can comment at all on churn as you look at your user base in Q4 or Q1. Any notable changes there, either Android or Apple platforms, would help us understand if competition is having any impact.", "And then on advertisers, just any thoughts on -- we saw the sequential decline, but how did you do on adding new advertisers in the first quarter? Did your total number of advertisers grow sequentially in Q1? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Overall, especially in the last half of last year, we had a really tough time with Android. That's still showing up in the numbers, as we mentioned. We added -- roughly 20% of our net adds from Android in Q4 and 30% in Q1. So we're making progress. But it's taking time and we're definitely digging out of a performance hole on Android. The low-hanging fruit, I would say, has been tackled in this past quarter, but we're making some larger structural changes that I think will make a big difference on Android over time.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, with regards to advertising, as we're -- continue to educate the market, one thing to keep in mind there our ad business -- we really start monetizing our business. The first ad ran on Snapchat in Q4 of 2014 and our ad business is still very, very nascent. So as we continue to educate the market, expand the sales force, opening new market, we continue to see more and more advertisers coming to our platform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel.", "Brian White", "Evan, I wonder if you could comment a little bit about the smartphone market. More smartphones are going to come with 3D sensors. It's going to support more AR activities. So I'm wondering how we should think about this as either a threat or an opportunity for Snap. So that's one question. Second question is just long term thoughts on China and also on Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Obviously all these improvements and sensors, et cetera, are really exciting for us and obviously fun to play with. The tough thing with any of these sort of device-specific improvements is that they are really hard for all of our community to enjoy. So instead, we've really invested in building a lot of our own technology that works well with a single camera. So you see that technology in World Lenses; it looks simple, but that surface detection is tricky to do with single-camera devices. And so we invested a lot in making these next-generation AR products available to our user base. But, yes, obviously always excited about new technology.", "And then -- sorry, the second question?", "Brian White", "Just on China. The long term thoughts on China and Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, thanks. Sorry about that. In terms of China, we've learned so much from the Chinese market. In the very early days, Tencent invested in our business and we had the chance to spend a lot of time with them. We've always been in awe, frankly, of the innovation happening over there. And that's really as far as our relationship with China has progressed today. But we've invested in building out some engineering there and obviously it's really exciting for our business.", "And then Japan -- obviously a great market and we've been working more recently to develop content that specifically appeal -- Lenses and Creative Tools that appeal specifically to the Japanese market. So that's a market we're excited about over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Maybe a quick one on the infrastructure side of things. You mentioned the deals with Google and Amazon. Maybe thinking about how you feel about the interchangeability between the two services. When you think about how you engineer, do you build stuff in a modular fashion so you can quickly move it over from one cloud to another? And any color or comments around that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, the thing you're talking about, sort of like containerization, I think is definitely the long term goal with products like this. But the interesting thing about the state of the cloud market today is really how these different providers have entered the market.", "So you have AWS which was really created because Amazon was trying to meet the needs of their customers around Christmastime. They built all this excess capacity and then rented it out. And Google, obviously, who has entered the market and they have a totally different and very specific use case around search.", "And so what ends up happening is that both of these companies build different services. And so, for example, recently we've moved some of our operations to an Amazon data store that's a little bit less redundant than a Google data store, for example, but saves us a bunch of money. So right now, I think we're really picking and choosing the different products we want to use based on the offerings from the two providers.", "But I do think, yes, long term, obviously, the dream for the cloud is this idea of containerization. And that's something we continue to invest in, but that -- that's a sort of a step-by-step, not an overnight kind of thing.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded.", "Thank you very much. Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2018, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2018 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and we make no obligation to update our disclosures.", "For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. This information can be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for Investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends.", "These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com.

This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We began 2018 with several major Snapchat updates, and we continue to make progress in growing our advertising business and building tools for advertisers.", "This quarter, we rolled out the redesign of our application. This new design is driven by our fundamental belief that separating friends from professional content creators is important to both our mission and the long-term growth of our business.", "For example, we have known for a long time that creating public-facing content is a very different behavior from interacting with close friends, which makes it challenging for both to exist successfully in the same ecosystem. Before the redesign, Stories were sorted by recency, meaning that people who post most frequently were usually at the top of the list. Naturally, the most frequently-posting users tended to be people who create content as part of their job, compared to users who are just sharing their day with friends. As our community continued to grow, keeping friends and creators in the same feed made Snapchat feel less personal, because close friends were constantly buried below creators.", "We addressed these issues by separating friends from creators and by making it easier to find Stories from the people closest to you. Now personal friends no longer have to compete with creators, and people can find Stories based on the depth of their relationships rather than who is posting most often. We also built a new home for creators in a newly expanded Discover section. This enables us to properly invest in products, discovery, and monetization for our creators, while also supporting a larger variety of content on Snapchat. The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both.", "As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption, especially given the high frequency of daily engagement of our community. While we had an average of 191 million daily active users in Q1, our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average. We are already starting to see early signs of stabilization among our iOS users as people get used to the changes, but still have a lot of work to do to optimize the new design, especially for our Android users. Our time spent remained more than 30 minutes per day on average following the redesign, and we have also started to realize some of the positive benefits, including increased new user retention for older users.", "We are now focused on optimizing the redesign based on our ongoing experimentation and learning. For example, when we separated friends\u2019 Stories from creator Stories, we also moved them to the left side of the camera and merged them into the Chat feed. We learned that combining watching Stories and communicating with friends into the same place made it harder to optimize for both competing behaviors. We are currently rolling out an update to address this by sorting communication by recency and moving Stories from friends to the right side of the application, while maintaining the structural changes we have made around separating friends from creators and sorting friends\u2019 Stories by relationships. The redesign created a lot of new opportunities, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to refine and improve Snapchat.", "This overall process is indicative of how we approach product development at Snap. We start with a core belief that builds on our mission of empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. In this case, it is our long-standing belief that separating social interactions from media content encourages people to create and share Snaps with each other, while also providing better opportunities and incentives for media partners. We then build and optimize our products around these underlying values, prioritizing them over short-term growth. ", "While doing so can often lead our company to take bigger risks and endure the accompanying volatility, we do this for two reasons. First, we firmly believe that it\u2019s the right thing to do for our community, because it ensures that our various products maintain a cohesive vision and stay true to our mission. Second, starting from first principles often leads us to create novel and unexpected experiences, which naturally tend to be longer-term opportunities that are difficult to optimize based on short-term results. ", "For example, our focus on self-expression and living in the moment from the very beginning took a long time for people to understand and get used to, but over the years has helped Snapchat become one of the most-used cameras in the world, with more than 60% of our daily active users creating Snaps with our camera, even as we doubled our user base over the past 2.5 years. Furthermore, one of the great things about our software products is that we can modify and update them any time. This makes it easier for us to take these risks, knowing that we are constantly learning and optimizing our products to better achieve our mission over the long term.", "Android performance is still a weakness for us, but we are making significant progress. Given the volume of changes we made with the redesign, a number of performance regressions contributed to a disproportionately negative impact among Android users, and we are currently working on addressing them. While the investments we made in our performance automation systems have significantly improved the speed and scale at which we are able to identify and fix these kinds of issues, our legacy codebase remains a problem. ", "I\u2019m really excited about the new version of the Android application that I talked about last year, which has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be lightweight, performant, and modular, which we hope will alleviate many of the performance-related issues we see with new product launches and updates. We have been testing the rebuilt application internally and we have quite a bit more work to do before our expected launch in Q3 of this year. In the meantime, we are incorporating some of the new modular components like Discover and the Friend Feed into the existing application, which we hope will improve performance in the near term.", "We continue to lead in mobile content and augmented reality, with a lot of progress in both this quarter. During the Winter Olympics, more than 81 million people watched our coverage on Discover in nine different languages, quickly surpassing the reach of our Rio Summer Olympics coverage. In the United States alone, over 10 million people on average tuned in every day at the Games. The redesign also enabled us to experiment with our first live streaming experience so that our users could watch key moments of the Olympics in real time wherever they were.", "Additionally, our content is starting to find its way outside of our application and into the world. During March Madness, Snaps submitted to Our Story appeared on stadium jumbotrons at each of the 67 games, as well as on local and national broadcast television coverage of the tournament. Over 200 media organizations have featured Snaps or embedded the Snap Map in their online, social, and broadcast television channels since we enabled the functionality just a few months ago. We believe that broadening the distribution of the unique Snaps created by our community will inspire more people to download Snapchat and create Snaps using our camera.", "We expanded our augmented reality platform and offerings significantly this quarter. Lens Studio has seen incredible adoption. Over 200 of the Lenses created by our community were viewed over 1 million times in the few months since launch. Our community has used these tools in ways we would have never imagined, and they have inspired us to invest more in empowering their creativity. We recently upgraded Lens Studio to now support the creation of new experiences like soundboards, interactive paths, and face Lenses. We\u2019re also expanding the underlying architecture of Lenses with Snappables, our latest Lens format that helps our community collaborate and interact with their friends through augmented reality experiences.", "Despite some headwinds from our redesign, our advertising business has continued to grow. While our decision to migrate our Snap Ads business to our programmatic auction led to a short-term slowdown in our revenue growth last year, we made the transition quickly and the company is far better for it. We are now better able to manage and optimize our overall advertising business and auction dynamics, which has accelerated the pace with which we can improve ROI for our advertisers. In Q1, both the average cost per app install and the average cost per swipe in the United States were well under half of what they were the year before, and we are continuing to make improvements.", "Our self-serve products helped us increase the number of advertisers actively spending on our platform by 20 times over the past year, and we still have a lot of opportunity to expand from here. With a growing advertiser base, we are now also introducing both paid and organic tools and experiences for companies of all sizes. Snapcodes unlock experiences like creative tools and sticker packs, and we are seeing brands experimenting with Lens Studio to create unique campaigns. Additionally, our product roadmap for empowering creators will also benefit small and large businesses alike and give them a better organic presence on our service.", "Our total revenue for the quarter was $230.7 million, up 54% from last year. Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners. We believe that our current path forward will address both issues, and that our advertising business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from the tough decisions we make in order to create and maintain a positive and healthy environment for our community over the long term.", "Thanks again for joining the call, and I will now turn it over to Imran to talk about our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi, everyone. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $229 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year. Evan talked about the philosophy behind the redesign, which is ongoing and a learning process. In Q1, we learned a lot based on how our users reacted to the redesign. But because of that, we also experienced some short-term disruptions to the business. The rapid pace at which we changed the core product introduced increased volatility into our ads marketplace. While we did not grow as quickly as we wanted, our Snap Ad revenue grew 102% year-over-year, and was down only 6% sequentially in a seasonally tough quarter.", "Additionally, during the quarter, we had many conversations with our advertisers about the redesign. These have been challenging conversations, as we made the proactive and deliberate decision to prioritize our long-term consumer product goals over our short-term monetization goals. The impact was primarily felt in our Sponsored Creative Tools business. On top of the expected seasonally weaker demand, our Lens and Filter products, which generally have a higher average selling price, were challenged by a negative market narrative.", "We\u2019re also in the middle of transitioning these products to a programmatic, audience-based buy model, which has negatively impacted the average order value, or AOV, for the products. For example, in Q1, the total number of Lenses sold was up 16% year-over-year, but AOV was down 37%. This is similar to what we experienced during our Snap Ad transition. As we transition all products to our self-service tool, we believe we can drive broader advertiser adoption and ultimately, a long-term, sustainable business.", "While we anticipate that some of these factors may continue to impact our business in Q2, I\u2019m very excited about the second half of this year. This is because of the progress we are making in our three focus areas: number one, enhancing our ad product suite, two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers, and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. In December, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Stories, which allows advertisers to leverage the familiar Stories format that our community knows and loves. But, to better reflect the storytelling capabilities of this format, we\u2019re now calling them Story Ads. We recently brought Story Ads to our self-service tool so that advertisers can use the same advanced targeting that they use for Snap Ads. Since launching this format in the auction, users that chose to watch Story Ads viewed them for an average of over 20 seconds. We believe this is a strong indication that our community is continuing to embrace this format.", "On the direct response side, we continue to make great progress. We believe that when we show the right ad to the right user, it creates a win-win situation. Swipe rates are one indication of whether or not we are creating this win-win situation. Quarter-over-quarter, for campaigns optimized for swipes, we increased our swipe rates by 8 percentage points, while also increasing total swipes by nearly 14 percentage points. This is a testament to the great work that our ad ranking team is doing to show the right ad to the right person.", "We\u2019re also continuing to evolve our formats, and I\u2019m really excited about our recent launch of shoppable Augmented Reality. Since bringing Lenses to market in 2015, we have seen this product drive tons of engagement and even create pop culture moments. But we wanted to bring the power of creative tools to our direct response advertisers. While users are playing with a Lens in the camera, advertisers can now include a button that will redirect them to a long-form video, website, or the app store. The first brands to try this new format include sports company Adidas, maker of the Candy Crush video games King, and make-up brand Clairol. As we scale adoption of this product, we are confident that it will help accelerate the growth of our Lens business as well.", "Our second area of focus is developing efficient tools for advertisers. As we have outlined before, one of our key priorities is to grow our SMB, or Online Sales, business. The vast majority of businesses are SMBs, and they are increasingly adopting digital marketing platforms to grow their businesses. In order to onboard these advertisers, we have been rolling out our self-serve tools and investing to create a frictionless ad buying experience. We made good progress this quarter as evidenced by 30% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for our SMB business.", "We are also launching sophisticated tools for our large advertisers. For example, we recently launched our Reach and Frequency tool for Snap Ads to a handful of select advertisers in the US and UK. This has been a key request from advertisers looking to plan and buy in advance on Snapchat. Only a few other scaled platforms have brought this tool to market, and it offers predictable delivery and pricing, something that is very valuable for larger brand-focused campaigns. ", "We launched Reach and Frequency within our self-service platform and are partnering closely with Unilever UK, P&G US, Google US and UK, and Microsoft UK. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do to fully bring this tool to market, but we're excited that this new buying method will empower advertisers to efficiently share their stories on our platform.", "One of the products I\u2019m most excited about is Snap Pro for Business and Creators. This product will be made for public entities, from public figures to local businesses to charitable causes, that want to use our platform to organically reach an audience beyond friends and family. With Snap Pro, it will be easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us. We\u2019re still extremely early in our roll-out plan and just recently onboarded a select group of brands and creators.", "For our third area of focus, we remain strongly committed to proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ROI is the best incentive that we can offer our advertisers, and we have been working tirelessly to show it across multiple products and verticals.", "This quarter, we made great progress scaling adoption and usage of Snap Pixel. We nearly tripled the number of advertisers using the pixel quarter-over-quarter. We\u2019re seeing that this capability drives strong results, primarily for our SMB and commerce advertisers.", "One great example is the Ridge, a wallet brand that used Snap Pixel to create both custom and lookalike audiences based on people who made a purchase on their eCommerce site. This strategy delivered. They drove a 4.1 times Return on Ad Spend. It also delivered a 55% decrease in Cost per Action, or CPA, allowing the company to achieve an overall CPA that was more than 20% lower than on other ad platforms.", "We are excited for the future of Snap Pixel as we continue investing in improvements such as the ability to optimize delivery based on lower-funnel events.", "We also understand how important it is for advertisers to measure impact across platforms. From television to social platforms, we want to demonstrate that advertising on Snapchat increases value to an advertiser\u2019s overall strategy. We recently collaborated with Nielsen, using their Total Ad Ratings, which allow advertisers to measure the incremental reach of their Snapchat campaigns relative to TV campaigns. Despite being outspent 25:1 by television, Snapchat campaigns were able to deliver 8% incremental reach on top of TV campaigns for the same set of brands.", "Finally, we are continuing to work with our third-party ecosystem to demonstrate ROI for all verticals. We conducted a series of custom marketing mix model studies with Nielsen to measure the effectiveness of Snapchat advertising within the beer category. The studies showed that Snapchat was more efficient than both traditional channels and other forms of digital media. Snap Ads outperformed the category media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.7 times, while Lenses and Filters outperformed the media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.3 times.", "Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and I\u2019m optimistic about the future of our business.", "Thank you for your time. I will now hand it off to Drew for a financial update.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. In the quarter, we made continued progress against our three financial goals: first, grow users and sales; second, leverage our cost structure; and third, soundly manage cash. As Imran mentioned, sales grew meaningfully year-over-year. Equally important, sales growth continues to well outpace our cost growth year-over-year.", "Over the past few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to make the right long-term decisions for our business. One of our core financial strategies was to invest early ahead of the sales curve to build the right cost structure that we could both scale with our growth and leverage over time.", "In the first quarter, we successfully leveraged our cost structure. Year-over-year sales growth was over 1.5 times our cost growth, and sequential costs were up only 1% in the quarter. On a per-user basis, ARPU increased 34% year-over-year, twice as fast as our CoRPU growth. Cost of revenue grew modestly, and operating expenses were sequentially down for the second time in three quarters, excluding restructuring charges.", "An efficient cost structure is a central part of our financial roadmap. We will continue to invest in strategic areas like innovation, new products, and people to fuel future growth. That said, we believe many of these opportunities can be funded by running our business more effectively, in areas like the back of house and hosting infrastructure. As we continue to successfully manage our cost structure, it should continue to yield two key benefits. First, we see strong incremental flow-through on revenue growth. And second, we can continue to moderate our cash burn, which we did again in Q1, as cash burn was less than half the rate from a few quarters ago.", "Let me now expand on the results for the quarter. First, global revenues were 231 million in the first quarter, and we saw growth in every region. International markets now represent 26% of our total revenue, up from 14% a year ago and 23% in Q4. Consistent with prior quarters, the fastest growing product in Q1 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold programmatically. Strength in Snap Ads more than offset softness in Creative Tools sales, which were down in the quarter.", "As expected, auction revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing. Let me share some numbers with you. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, were up over 450% year-over-year and over 15% sequentially. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Story Ads, was down nearly 65% year-over-year and nearly 20% sequentially. Third, we ended the quarter with 95% of our Snaps Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, served programmatically, up from 90% in the prior quarter.", "In the quarter, we added many new programs to the Discover page. In February, we partnered with NBC to bring the Winter Olympics to Snapchat users. We offered a series of creative ad products and packages to our advertisers, which drove incremental revenues for the business. Financially, the Olympics were a nice revenue boost, but comprised less than 10% of total revenues for the quarter.", "Now, let me talk about expenses. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures, including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Cost of revenue expenses grew $7 million in the quarter, driven by three factors. First, higher revenue share on Olympic content; second, incremental infrastructure costs related to the launch of the app redesign; and third, the addition of 4.2 million new DAUs. Hosting costs per user increased from $0.70 in Q4 to $0.73 in Q1, but hosting cost increases moderated during the quarter as our engineering team continued to optimize new code to reduce infrastructure expenses.", "On operating expenses, the primary driver remains people cost. Over the last few years, we have consistently invested to build an organization with the scale to compete. We hired over 2,400 people in the last two years and we\u2019re now digesting that rapid growth in an evolving world. As a result, during Q1 we had a 7% reduction in force, in order to better align resources around our top strategic priorities and reflect structural changes in our business.", "Consistent with earlier disclosures, the company recorded a charge of $9.9 million in the first quarter, but those charges have been adjusted out of EBITDA. We expect to realize $7 million to $8 million in ongoing savings per quarter. In the first quarter, OpEx costs were $257 million, down 1% sequentially, and overall headcount declined 3% for the period.", "Let me briefly touch on our capital-deployment priorities, which remain reinvesting in strategic areas of our business like product, content, AR, automation, and international expansion as well as opportunistic M&A. Q1 CapEx remained modest at $36 million and we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. As of March 31, 2018, total shares outstanding were 1.254 billion and 1.457 billion on a fully diluted basis.", "Let me now share some near-term observations on our business. First, as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels, with growth in auction impressions, partially offset by pricing for both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. We are planning for infrastructure costs to increase modestly in the short-term as we continue to test and rollout further changes to the application, partially offset by hosting cost efficiency programs. Revenue share expenses should moderate without Olympic content.", "We continue to plan for modest operating expense growth in the near term. Consistent with last quarter, we are planning for the first half of 2018 to grow by low double-digits versus the back half of 2017, excluding one-time charges. Please note operating expenses exclude cost of revenue, stock-based compensation, and our move to Santa Monica.", "Consistent with prior disclosures on the Venice exit, we expect to incur $25 million to $45 million in charges throughout 2018, primarily in the second and third quarters, to reflect the exit cost of these Venice buildings. The majority of these charges are cash payments due on remaining lease terms. We are planning for CapEx to be slightly elevated in the near term, as we continue our buildout of leased Santa Monica facilities and execute our move throughout 2018.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q1 expense was $143.2 million. Please note that this number included a one-time benefit of $32 million, as a result of the reduction in force plan we implemented during the quarter. We believe that the stock-based compensation rate in the second half of 2017 is a good proxy for the short-term. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Two questions, guys. One for Evan and then one for Drew. Evan, on the DAUs, it seems like anytime you guys are making changes to the Android app, you're running into some performance issues and DAUs tend to drop off. So I guess what gives you the confidence as you ship this new Android code in the second half of this year that we'll see a stabilization and when do you expect Android to use to start kind of consistently picking up.", "And then Drew, you mentioned the 2Q revenue growth will be substantially lower, so would that just be Olympics impact coming out or can you talk a little bit more specifically about the deceleration in ad revenue versus the 61% in the first quarter. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi, Ross. We should have made a lot of changes faster in our engineering organization and really put Android first. Now, and I'm starting -- last year, we started re-architecting the entire application and rebuilding it from scratch and we now have a bunch of those components and we're testing some already in the application, but ultimately it\u2019s the re-architecture that will make a big difference and I think beyond just the performance improvements that we're going to see, it will also enable our entire team to move a lot faster as we build new features. Right now, if we build a new feature, the codebase is so complex, we tend to break other things and I think reducing the complexity through modularization will make a huge difference in our ability to execute quickly on the product roadmap.", "Drew Vollero", "So Ross, as it relates to the second quarter, we were really focused on the strategic activities in business, not necessarily the near term financial targets. We're really focused on improving the redesign, improving Android, driving users to platform, driving our advertiser ROI. If you look at the platform itself at the product level, we have strength in Span Ads that direct response business is doing quite well internationally, has been a growing force as well. But look, at the end of the day, we are transitioning right now to the creative tool business Imran talked about in his opening remarks and we really are focused on being the value leader in the advertising platform and so what we're not doing is playing the pricing game to maximize short term revenues. We're really more focused on bringing advertisers to the platform and making sure advertisers have solid ROIs. There was a modest boost in the quarter as you mentioned, to Olympic revenue, which we don't expect to continue in Q2, but that's not a big piece of the story here.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mark Mahaney", "In the past, I think you've talked about crash levels on the Android app, any sort of update there as to how they're trending? And then you talked about this disruption to users. What have you seen in the quarter so far in terms of those disruptions to users, any impact on engagement? Does it seem to you like you're back to normal with your users\u2019 use of the app? Is there still a lot of experimentation just how would you address the volatility of the overall user base in response to the redesigns?", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. No specific updates on the crash levels. I do want to talk about one of the big changes that we're making to Snap, which I think will make a big difference. When we redesign the application, we combine the stories and chats from your friends onto the same page. And we like having all the stuff from your friends in one place, because it was a lot easier to find, but we didn't realize how hard it would be to optimize for those two different behaviors, talking with friends and watching their stories and it turns out it's really hard to optimize for both at the same time. So one of the biggest changes that we're making is moving stories from your friends over to the Discover page and putting it at the top of the page. So they'll still be separate from all the other content on our service, but that way your friends come first, no matter where you are in the application, but we can still optimize for watching content on one side of service and communicating with friends on the other. So that's a big change coming and we think it will make a difference.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "Great. Two things. I think in your prepared remarks, you said users were stabilizing in April, maybe you could revisit that a little bit? And then Imran, how much of the 2Q deceleration is related to the redesign and how are you thinking, you mentioned you expected a big back half, how would you think about an improvement in the back half on advertising?", "Imran Khan", "Yes. Hi. So let's take the second question first. So I think one of the things that we have done, we listen to our advertisers very closely and what are the products that they want and I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about how we will have launched reach and frequency with two advertisers. We also launching SNAP Pro, which will let people to create content and then ultimately promote those content. We are also launching lower funnel optimization for our performance advertising products. All of those things, I think, will significantly help our advertisers to take leverage of our platform. And then on top of that, what we're doing in terms of on ad ranking side by improving swipe rate and showing the right ad to the right users. And as our mission gets better and better, I think there's a lot of opportunities on that. So I'm really optimistic that I think we're doing the right thing and building the right thing.", "In terms of Evan\u2019s comment on, I think we said we are seeing early sign of stabilization on iOS.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Evan, I think at the time of the IPO one of the concerns was the need for your ad ops teams to essentially vet the creative, so that if fits in with the surrounding content and does not work against a consumer experience, but now that you are going more self-service, you have certain instances, which I guess result in the negative market creative, you touched on earlier. So it seems like there's a need to police the add creators as well, so is there a technology base or some other type of solution that can look for that type of ad content to take down? And Imran, a question on the story is the need to reformat the ad content to vertical presentations still a headwind for you? And if so, what are you doing to help advertisers either from a technology or proper perspective?", "Evan Spiegel", "Stephen. Yeah, we have a lot of empathy for the ad reviewers who work on our business. It's a tough job. We really consider them digital first responders in a sense and so we're definitely building out a lot of programs to try and help them do their jobs more effectively and we always feel terrible when mistakes are made, but we're making progress there and really we want to do our best to support the team and doing their job.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to story ad, I think what we're seeing that market is more and more embracing our format. I think 3.5 years ago, when you started the ad business, I think this full screen vertical video was very foreign to many advertisers and we heard a lot of pushback, but I think over the years, we have seen that advertisers are seeing the value of the full screen ad and the storytelling ad and we're seeing that other advertisers, other publishers also embracing these formats. So I think it is -- the headwind is getting better and I think we're also building a lot of creatives and I think one of our mission is creating friction less application experience and I think we're making a lot of progress there and we continue to invest on that technology.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "We\u2019ve seen some of the changes that you're talking about in terms of separating out stories and from Snaps and sort of the next evolution of this redesign, realize, it's extremely early, but any sort of indication in terms of how users are reacting to that. I know you're not going to go into specific metrics, but just even qualitatively what you're hearing from them? And then to the extent that we're sort of seeing pricing fluctuation, the way we are in the early innings of your moves into the programmatic, any sense sort of where pricing on any sort of like for like basis is shaking out between where Snap and other major digital platforms would be? I know it's not always easy to compare apples and oranges, but whether it's a ROI metric or price per engagement, would be curious in any benchmarking you might be able to share insight into.", "Evan Spiegel", "When we build products, we\u2019re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away, we're thinking a lot about how our products that we've built will help us accomplish our mission. So, we build things that we believe that will help us empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And so I think it's really important to understand that people think about self-expression on Snapchat in different ways. So some people would rather create content with just a small audience of their friends and other people want to create content if they have a much bigger audience because they want to reach more people. ", "And so our job is to make Snap work well for all different types of people so that we can empower people to express themselves. And with the redesign in particular, we try to make Snapchat feel more personal for people who want to use it exclusively with their friends and also more valuable for people who want to use at large audience, because we want to do both really well. So we believe the redesign brings us closer to accomplishing our mission. And we're continuing to iterate very quickly on the things that we don't like.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to pricing, we are really focused on driving advertisers ROI and bringing more and more advertisers on our platform, because when you have a lot more users, we have more choices to show to the right users. And I think we're also a new platform, so we want advertisers to learn our platform and how to win on our platform. And so fundamentally, we're not really focused on pricing right now, we are really more focused on bringing more advertisers on the platform and helping them understand our platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "I think you mentioned earlier that pricing is down 65% year-on-year and then when talking about the substantial de-sell [ph] in Q2, I think you noted that pricing is a primary driver there. I guess the question is where are we in that adjustment period and at what point do you expect that pricing will begin to stabilize? And then in terms of the redesign we\u2019re putting friends\u2019 stories above discover content, what impact do you think that that will have on engagement with commercial content and ultimately with some of the ad revenues that flow through that part of the channel.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to pricing, the 65% decline year-over-year really represents the change in selling method, we used to have a direct sales force that sold of the ads top of funnel. Now, we\u2019ve gone to programmatic, and so that's really led to the year-over-year decline. I'll echo Imran\u2019s sentiments, right now, the key activities that we're focused on are really bringing advertisers to the platform. We need a broader base of advertisers using our product and then see if really we're very focused on ROI. We do think that will be the number one metric for us in the long term success. So that's what we're focused on far more than sort of where pricing bottoms out. We don't have the near term plan for that.", "Evan Spiegel", "In terms of the Discover product, we believe that making Snapchat is the best place to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. We will build a larger audience for creators and ultimately benefit them and we\u2019re also introducing a lot of new tools this year for creators, which we believe will inspire them to continue creating great content for Snap. So ultimately, we're taking a long view here and we believe that as users experience our products, we will be able to build our audience and that will benefit creators.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Two if I can. First Imran, I think you said March average DAU is lower than 1Q average, but still up in the 4Q average, which seems to imply that maybe March ended lower than where you were in December kind of on a period end basis. Can you kind of talk about if April is down from March and then do you think the early results from moving friends\u2019 stories back to the right side of the camera does suggest that allowing help stabilize DAU?", "And then secondly, can you give us a sense for what percent of ad revenue now is coming from performance advertisers and maybe a sense of how the more sophisticated performance advertisers who have adopted the best most sophisticated tools, how they\u2019re scaling budgets plus those adoption rates. Can you maybe give us an update on the percent of at Ad Age 100 that are still spending if you will from the kind of 1Q \u201916 period, so can you give us that would be great.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I'll take from the like last question first. Look. I think we're seeing great success with a lot of the large advertisers. We strengthen our relationship with several brands like take McDonald's as an excellent example, they have pushed a multiproduct approach for nearly every campaign, always looking to test, optimize and learn with us. In fact, they were one of the first advertisers to test audience filters in action, creating seven different filters and targeting each one to a niche audience. ", "But most importantly, over the years, Snapchat has gone from being a platform that McDonald's would leverage periodically to an always on long term partners. Year over year, McDonald's grew their investment triple digit with us. So we're really pleased, we had a lot of success stories like that. We're becoming true business partner for a lot of large advertisers but at the same time we're seeing healthy growth in our performance advertising campaign. And I think we\u2019ve got great feedback from them and based on that, we're trying to bring creative tools also to the DR customers and that business is going at a very healthy rate and we're very, very excited about it.", "With regards to DAU, I think we gave you the average for the quarter was 191 million. Q4 average was 187. I believe what Evan talked about in his prepared remarks that March was lower than our Q1 average of 191, but higher than the Q4 average of 187. So that should give you a pretty good guidance where that numbers were in March.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.", "Jason Helfstein", "I wanted to dig a bit more. So for all the examples of McDonald's of triple digits, I guess how much of the weakness or relative to what we're all expecting was from advertisers who pulled back because of call it misunderstanding or questions or publicity and so the point is like what did it take to get those advertisers back. And is that -- the point being you expect those advertisers to be back in the third quarter, just go a little bit deeper into that, what caused the advertisers toward spending to pull back and what makes you -- and what gives you confidence they come back.", "Imran Khan", "Look, I think -- thanks for asking the question. At the end of the day, advertisers are rational. They want to advertise and they want to drive return on their ad spend. But at the same time, they're human. When there's a lot of negative news on the press every day, it does give people pause, it does influence people buying decisions, know it's very hard to handicap how what percentage, but that does come out on the conversation and become a disruption on the selling process. But I think the way to win is by proving otherwise, right. The examples like McDonald's or some of the examples that I shared on the call, when we go and prove that, but I just had the money that this spent and we drive value for them. ", "It's really, really important. I think one of the things that is really important to understand that the Snapchat\u2019s position in the millennial audience, right, there are over 90 million millennials in the US today and they represent the single largest generation ever defined. Millennials are expected to become a huge economic force in the coming years that already dominating lot of buying decisions. And we have a very strong position in that demographic and some of the investment that our product team and engineering team did to swing the right ad to the right audience. I think that we -- and we just need to prove those ROIs and educate the market and that's ultimately drive value for everybody.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge ", "So ad impressive growth has been significant the past several quarters, just wondering how you feel about ad loads and ability to raise ad loads and then just any update on engagement. I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it, time spent on the platform, anything there would be helpful?", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think again -- I think about the problem is ad is a piece of content and when it's a piece of content, you have to show the most relevant content to the most relevant person and that really drives the engagement, right. If I show you one content that you don't care about it, if I show you one piece of content, you will be annoyed. If I show you three great pieces of content that you really, really like and you want to engage with it, that you will like it. So I think rather than thinking about the ad load, what we have been challenging our product team and our engineering team, are we doing the best job showing the most relevant content to our users. When you do that, everybody wins. And I think one of the thing I talked about in the call that how we saw 8 percentage point increase in swipe rate. And I think that's really, really exciting and that's something I think there's a lot more work to be done and we continue to push out teams to do that. ", "In terms of time spent, I think Evan mentioned in the call that more than over 30 minutes people are due to spend on our platform, over 30 minutes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Just first you talk about self-serve helping increase the advertiser number 20x over the past year. Just curious if you\u2019ve quantified that number? And then, Imran, can you just talk more about the concept, the moving to always on spending and how much that's actually happening across the platforms at this point? And then just quickly, do you think you're seeing any impact in users from competitive entertainment like Fortnite and PUBG?", "Imran Khan", "So with regards to -- look I think in terms of number of advertisers, we launch our self-serve platform in Q2 of last year. So it's a very new platform. So we have a lot of room to grow our number of advertisers on our platform, and I think so we have a lot of work to do and we're very pleased with the growth, but we want to grow faster and there's a lot of room to grow.", "With regards to competitive pressure from other games like Fortnite, my son who is 8 years old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend, but I think it's really hard for me to sit here and predict how that's spending impacting time on our platform at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two. The first one, appreciate the color on the Snap ad versus the creative tools, the lender\u2019s growth in the quarter. Wondering, could you talk us through how we should think about the growth trajectory of those two businesses over the course of the year, maybe the relative size and just to think about the puts and takes on revenue growth between those two buckets this year?", "And the second one, you talked a lot about a focus to bring more advertisers on to the platform. Maybe talk through philosophically how has your advertiser onboarding process changed between large advertisers and SMBs. What are the keys to success going forward?", "Drew Vollero", "Good. As it relates to the product mix, we never really quantify the difference between the Snap ads and the creative tools. We gave some sense maybe a couple of years ago about the size of a business we described in a sort of a good one two combination and both very meaningful to our business. I would say with the move to programmatic over the last six to twelve months, the Snap Ads business has become a much bigger piece of our business than the creative tools. And so the Snap Ads business continues to grow. We have good traction internationally. We have good traction on the DR side of the world. So we are definitely seeing that being the engine that\u2019s fueling our growth right now. I think the creative business will continue \u2013 the creative tool business will continue to transition that as we commented on in the second quarter here, those are -- that's what we're seeing in the near term. So right now, the bulk of the revenue is being driven by the Snap ads business and that's really the engine that's going to fuel our growth in the near term.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think to add on Drew\u2019s color, I think our creative tool business also have a lot of opportunities like more recently we launched Lens Studios for example. It really democratize who can create lenses. I think one of the big challenge for a lot of the small businesses to create creative tools is that they have to work with us directly, but as the Lens Studios and those things proliferated, they have the opportunities for a lot of advertisers to embrace this creative tools business, that's also opened up new revenue opportunity for us. So I think we feel very excited about that, how we are monetizing camera and at the same time, we\u2019re monetizing content on our platform and how there are a lot more opportunities to do that. ", "With regards to your second question, how you\u2019re addressing the market, we break up ourselves in two different groups. One is DSO, direct sales organization who focus on the large advertisers and they are really a sales consultant for those. The second bucket is our global online sales team, so that has combination of inside sales and our channel partners. So we partner with other channels who actually sell on behalf of us as well. So that's how we were trying to cover across the market and educate them about the platform and to help onboard more and more advertisers on the platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Rich Greenfield", "Hi. A few questions. First just housekeeping. I wanted to follow up on the question before regarding Evan's commentary on DAUs If you look at kind of March 2018 quarter end, should we infer basically, is the inference essentially that March quarter end for \u201918 was actually below December 2017 quarter end? And then two, on product, Evan, you mentioned shifting friends\u2019 content over to the right, which I certainly understand, but part of the new right side redesign not only was it algorithmic, but it was also kind of everything. ", "So it was like one solid flowing experience where it almost felt like you got lost and you were just clicking, you have this kind of infinite array of content. Now, as you start to separate out friends from everything else, discover, kind of brand/implementers, how does that impact time spent in the discover/influencer content on the right side relative to friends? And then just a part of that, could that actually cause a disruption as you kind of shift the stories back to the right, are we looking at another potential disruption in user behavior, as people get used to that type of a change back. That would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So overall, as we look at the redesign, the thing that we're most excited about is creating this infinite scroll content. As you mentioned, in the past, the right side of the application really only had your friends\u2019 stories and a very small select group of publishers without a lot of personalization. And so I think one of the really great things that we've been able to accomplish with the redesign is putting your friends at the top, making them most important, but also still opening up into this world of personalized content below. So I think, we're going to get the best of both worlds in that sense and still create an environment where people feel empowered to express themselves.", "And I don't think we can give you any specifics on the earlier DAU question, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore.", "Anthony DiClemente", "I just wanted to follow up on that question about content. In terms of \u2013 it just sounds based on what you\u2019ve said Evan that there could be a transition and emphasis to user generated content, given the changes in the Discover tab and I guess if not, maybe just what is your forward strategy with respect to licensed professional content from here?", "And then a question for Drew, you stated in your prepared remarks that future acquisitions will likely be additive to stock-based compensation. So I'm curious what areas is Snap actively pursuing in terms of M&A and how do you think about balancing the potential M&A with your priorities around cash management from here?", "Drew Vollero", "Let me take the second one first and then I'll turn it over to Evan. Look, we've had a lot of success managing our cash burn rate over the last couple of quarters. We've reduced it by over 50%. How we've done that is we\u2019ve really focused the strategic capital deployment priorities here at the company. We're really focused on investing in our business. The M&A here will be very opportunistic. If we see the right thing at the right time at the right price, we\u2019ll go ahead and make that happen, but right now, we're focused on really the key strategic activities of growing our business around the design, around the Android, new advertisers\u2019 ROI, those are the strategic priorities in the business. If we have a chance to be opportunistic, with an acquisition, we will go ahead and do that. Historically, the acquisitions have been pretty tuck-in in nature. They've been focused more on technologies and talent than they have been sort of robust acquisitions, big companies, big business models, et cetera. So that's where we've been focused to date. And I'd look for again our strategic priorities for cash really to be the investment in the business.", "Evan Spiegel", "Ultimately, users\u2019 content has obviously been a strong suit for us for a very long time, because we're so focused on powering creativity, opening to the camera and building all these creative tools that inspire people to create. I think as we look at the redesign and the opportunity for publishers and creators, we're definitely excited about the progress we\u2019ll be able to make for both last year, we delivered $100 million in revenue to our partners and we're excited to build on that. So I think publishers will play a very important role in the future and also create more opportunities for creators and influencers to be successful on Snap.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust.", "Youssef Squali", "Two quick questions for me. First, maybe Evan, you referenced changes in market narrative as a reason for the softness. Just trying to understand kind of the other side of that is for the market narrative to change again, I'm assuming this is on the advertiser side, there is really no control necessarily in terms of timing. So you talked about how Q3 is going to be an inflection point for that, just trying to get a sense of, if advertisers have now, so to speak, put you guys in the penalty box, what kind of gives you the confidence that you can get out of it within a quarter? ", "And then on the profitability side, there were some news reports talking about how maybe you gave directives internally to accelerate dramatically accelerate the profitability of the business. First, is there any truth to that? And second, how do you look at and maybe this is a question for Drew partly as well, balance out the profitability versus the doubling down of the investments as you suggest in your prepared remarks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So in terms of profitability, obviously, building a sustainable business is what's going to allow us to pursue our mission for a really long time. So it's something we think about and I think we've made great progress over the last few years towards being able to fund our own growth. I think if we look at the big transition we made last year to our programmatic advertising business, I think the really great benefit of that is we've gotten a lot better at showing advertisers ROI, so the market narrative I think will matter less over time, as we continue to improve our measurement capabilities and to really deliver that for advertisers. So excited about the progress that we're making there. And you're right that it's important to focus on the performance business.", "Drew Vollero", "So, I will -- just to build on Evan's comments, I mean, it makes sense for us to build toward a breakeven. It's a logical next step for our business, but let's be clear, we really don't manage against that. There is no timeline to take that of the certain date. The key thing to remember is that, that's going to for us begin with growth. We need to continue to grow our user base. We need to grow our revenues. We\u2019re going to keep investing in areas like product innovation, AR and content to name a few. That said, Snap for breakeven also is going to revolve around carrying water in both shoulders for us, you have to be sensible about our cost structure. We have a moderate cost growth where it makes sense. We have a large infrastructure for a company our size. We\u2019re built for growth and you saw that in Q1 that we were able to leverage the cost structure, our cost growth was only up 1% sequentially. So there are opportunities for us to do things better and that should allow us to continue to make investments that will fuel our growth.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded.", "Thank you very much. Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2018, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2018 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and we make no obligation to update our disclosures.", "For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. This information can be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for Investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends.", "These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com. At times in our prepared remarks, or in response to questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly and annual results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We began 2018 with several major Snapchat updates, and we continue to make progress in growing our advertising business and building tools for advertisers.", "This quarter, we rolled out the redesign of our application. This new design is driven by our fundamental belief that separating friends from professional content creators is important to both our mission and the long-term growth of our business.", "For example, we have known for a long time that creating public-facing content is a very different behavior from interacting with close friends, which makes it challenging for both to exist successfully in the same ecosystem. Before the redesign, Stories were sorted by recency, meaning that people who post most frequently were usually at the top of the list. Naturally, the most frequently-posting users tended to be people who create content as part of their job, compared to users who are just sharing their day with friends. As our community continued to grow, keeping friends and creators in the same feed made Snapchat feel less personal, because close friends were constantly buried below creators.", "We addressed these issues by separating friends from creators and by making it easier to find Stories from the people closest to you. Now personal friends no longer have to compete with creators, and people can find Stories based on the depth of their relationships rather than who is posting most often. We also built a new home for creators in a newly expanded Discover section. This enables us to properly invest in products, discovery, and monetization for our creators, while also supporting a larger variety of content on Snapchat. The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both.", "As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption, especially given the high frequency of daily engagement of our community. While we had an average of 191 million daily active users in Q1, our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average. We are already starting to see early signs of stabilization among our iOS users as people get used to the changes, but still have a lot of work to do to optimize the new design, especially for our Android users. Our time spent remained more than 30 minutes per day on average following the redesign, and we have also started to realize some of the positive benefits, including increased new user retention for older users.", "We are now focused on optimizing the redesign based on our ongoing experimentation and learning. For example, when we separated friends\u2019 Stories from creator Stories, we also moved them to the left side of the camera and merged them into the Chat feed. We learned that combining watching Stories and communicating with friends into the same place made it harder to optimize for both competing behaviors. We are currently rolling out an update to address this by sorting communication by recency and moving Stories from friends to the right side of the application, while maintaining the structural changes we have made around separating friends from creators and sorting friends\u2019 Stories by relationships. The redesign created a lot of new opportunities, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to refine and improve Snapchat.", "This overall process is indicative of how we approach product development at Snap. We start with a core belief that builds on our mission of empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. In this case, it is our long-standing belief that separating social interactions from media content encourages people to create and share Snaps with each other, while also providing better opportunities and incentives for media partners. We then build and optimize our products around these underlying values, prioritizing them over short-term growth. ", "While doing so can often lead our company to take bigger risks and endure the accompanying volatility, we do this for two reasons. First, we firmly believe that it\u2019s the right thing to do for our community, because it ensures that our various products maintain a cohesive vision and stay true to our mission. Second, starting from first principles often leads us to create novel and unexpected experiences, which naturally tend to be longer-term opportunities that are difficult to optimize based on short-term results. ", "For example, our focus on self-expression and living in the moment from the very beginning took a long time for people to understand and get used to, but over the years has helped Snapchat become one of the most-used cameras in the world, with more than 60% of our daily active users creating Snaps with our camera, even as we doubled our user base over the past 2.5 years. Furthermore, one of the great things about our software products is that we can modify and update them any time. This makes it easier for us to take these risks, knowing that we are constantly learning and optimizing our products to better achieve our mission over the long term.", "Android performance is still a weakness for us, but we are making significant progress. Given the volume of changes we made with the redesign, a number of performance regressions contributed to a disproportionately negative impact among Android users, and we are currently working on addressing them. While the investments we made in our performance automation systems have significantly improved the speed and scale at which we are able to identify and fix these kinds of issues, our legacy codebase remains a problem. ", "I\u2019m really excited about the new version of the Android application that I talked about last year, which has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be lightweight, performant, and modular, which we hope will alleviate many of the performance-related issues we see with new product launches and updates. We have been testing the rebuilt application internally and we have quite a bit more work to do before our expected launch in Q3 of this year. In the meantime, we are incorporating some of the new modular components like Discover and the Friend Feed into the existing application, which we hope will improve performance in the near term.", "We continue to lead in mobile content and augmented reality, with a lot of progress in both this quarter. During the Winter Olympics, more than 81 million people watched our coverage on Discover in nine different languages, quickly surpassing the reach of our Rio Summer Olympics coverage. In the United States alone, over 10 million people on average tuned in every day at the Games. The redesign also enabled us to experiment with our first live streaming experience so that our users could watch key moments of the Olympics in real time wherever they were.", "Additionally, our content is starting to find its way outside of our application and into the world. During March Madness, Snaps submitted to Our Story appeared on stadium jumbotrons at each of the 67 games, as well as on local and national broadcast television coverage of the tournament. Over 200 media organizations have featured Snaps or embedded the Snap Map in their online, social, and broadcast television channels since we enabled the functionality just a few months ago. We believe that broadening the distribution of the unique Snaps created by our community will inspire more people to download Snapchat and create Snaps using our camera.", "We expanded our augmented reality platform and offerings significantly this quarter. Lens Studio has seen incredible adoption. Over 200 of the Lenses created by our community were viewed over 1 million times in the few months since launch. Our community has used these tools in ways we would have never imagined, and they have inspired us to invest more in empowering their creativity. We recently upgraded Lens Studio to now support the creation of new experiences like soundboards, interactive paths, and face Lenses. We\u2019re also expanding the underlying architecture of Lenses with Snappables, our latest Lens format that helps our community collaborate and interact with their friends through augmented reality experiences.", "Despite some headwinds from our redesign, our advertising business has continued to grow. While our decision to migrate our Snap Ads business to our programmatic auction led to a short-term slowdown in our revenue growth last year, we made the transition quickly and the company is far better for it. We are now better able to manage and optimize our overall advertising business and auction dynamics, which has accelerated the pace with which we can improve ROI for our advertisers. In Q1, both the average cost per app install and the average cost per swipe in the United States were well under half of what they were the year before, and we are continuing to make improvements.", "Our self-serve products helped us increase the number of advertisers actively spending on our platform by 20 times over the past year, and we still have a lot of opportunity to expand from here. With a growing advertiser base, we are now also introducing both paid and organic tools and experiences for companies of all sizes. Snapcodes unlock experiences like creative tools and sticker packs, and we are seeing brands experimenting with Lens Studio to create unique campaigns. Additionally, our product roadmap for empowering creators will also benefit small and large businesses alike and give them a better organic presence on our service.", "Our total revenue for the quarter was $230.7 million, up 54% from last year. Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners. We believe that our current path forward will address both issues, and that our advertising business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from the tough decisions we make in order to create and maintain a positive and healthy environment for our community over the long term.", "Thanks again for joining the call, and I will now turn it over to Imran to talk about our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi, everyone. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $229 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year. Evan talked about the philosophy behind the redesign, which is ongoing and a learning process. In Q1, we learned a lot based on how our users reacted to the redesign. But because of that, we also experienced some short-term disruptions to the business. The rapid pace at which we changed the core product introduced increased volatility into our ads marketplace. While we did not grow as quickly as we wanted, our Snap Ad revenue grew 102% year-over-year, and was down only 6% sequentially in a seasonally tough quarter.", "Additionally, during the quarter, we had many conversations with our advertisers about the redesign. These have been challenging conversations, as we made the proactive and deliberate decision to prioritize our long-term consumer product goals over our short-term monetization goals. The impact was primarily felt in our Sponsored Creative Tools business. On top of the expected seasonally weaker demand, our Lens and Filter products, which generally have a higher average selling price, were challenged by a negative market narrative.", "We\u2019re also in the middle of transitioning these products to a programmatic, audience-based buy model, which has negatively impacted the average order value, or AOV, for the products. For example, in Q1, the total number of Lenses sold was up 16% year-over-year, but AOV was down 37%. This is similar to what we experienced during our Snap Ad transition. As we transition all products to our self-service tool, we believe we can drive broader advertiser adoption and ultimately, a long-term, sustainable business.", "While we anticipate that some of these factors may continue to impact our business in Q2, I\u2019m very excited about the second half of this year. This is because of the progress we are making in our three focus areas: number one, enhancing our ad product suite, two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers, and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. In December, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Stories, which allows advertisers to leverage the familiar Stories format that our community knows and loves. But, to better reflect the storytelling capabilities of this format, we\u2019re now calling them Story Ads. We recently brought Story Ads to our self-service tool so that advertisers can use the same advanced targeting that they use for Snap Ads. Since launching this format in the auction, users that chose to watch Story Ads viewed them for an average of over 20 seconds. We believe this is a strong indication that our community is continuing to embrace this format.", "On the direct response side, we continue to make great progress. We believe that when we show the right ad to the right user, it creates a win-win situation. Swipe rates are one indication of whether or not we are creating this win-win situation. Quarter-over-quarter, for campaigns optimized for swipes, we increased our swipe rates by 8 percentage points, while also increasing total swipes by nearly 14 percentage points. This is a testament to the great work that our ad ranking team is doing to show the right ad to the right person.", "We\u2019re also continuing to evolve our formats, and I\u2019m really excited about our recent launch of shoppable Augmented Reality. Since bringing Lenses to market in 2015, we have seen this product drive tons of engagement and even create pop culture moments. But we wanted to bring the power of creative tools to our direct response advertisers. While users are playing with a Lens in the camera, advertisers can now include a button that will redirect them to a long-form video, website, or the app store. The first brands to try this new format include sports company Adidas, maker of the Candy Crush video games King, and make-up brand Clairol. As we scale adoption of this product, we are confident that it will help accelerate the growth of our Lens business as well.", "Our second area of focus is developing efficient tools for advertisers. As we have outlined before, one of our key priorities is to grow our SMB, or Online Sales, business. The vast majority of businesses are SMBs, and they are increasingly adopting digital marketing platforms to grow their businesses. In order to onboard these advertisers, we have been rolling out our self-serve tools and investing to create a frictionless ad buying experience. We made good progress this quarter as evidenced by 30% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for our SMB business.", "We are also launching sophisticated tools for our large advertisers. For example, we recently launched our Reach and Frequency tool for Snap Ads to a handful of select advertisers in the US and UK. This has been a key request from advertisers looking to plan and buy in advance on Snapchat. Only a few other scaled platforms have brought this tool to market, and it offers predictable delivery and pricing, something that is very valuable for larger brand-focused campaigns. ", "We launched Reach and Frequency within our self-service platform and are partnering closely with Unilever UK, P&G US, Google US and UK, and Microsoft UK. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do to fully bring this tool to market, but we're excited that this new buying method will empower advertisers to efficiently share their stories on our platform.", "One of the products I\u2019m most excited about is Snap Pro for Business and Creators. This product will be made for public entities, from public figures to local businesses to charitable causes, that want to use our platform to organically reach an audience beyond friends and family. With Snap Pro, it will be easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us. We\u2019re still extremely early in our roll-out plan and just recently onboarded a select group of brands and creators.", "For our third area of focus, we remain strongly committed to proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ROI is the best incentive that we can offer our advertisers, and we have been working tirelessly to show it across multiple products and verticals.", "This quarter, we made great progress scaling adoption and usage of Snap Pixel. We nearly tripled the number of advertisers using the pixel quarter-over-quarter. We\u2019re seeing that this capability drives strong results, primarily for our SMB and commerce advertisers.", "One great example is the Ridge, a wallet brand that used Snap Pixel to create both custom and lookalike audiences based on people who made a purchase on their eCommerce site. This strategy delivered. They drove a 4.1 times Return on Ad Spend. It also delivered a 55% decrease in Cost per Action, or CPA, allowing the company to achieve an overall CPA that was more than 20% lower than on other ad platforms.", "We are excited for the future of Snap Pixel as we continue investing in improvements such as the ability to optimize delivery based on lower-funnel events.", "We also understand how important it is for advertisers to measure impact across platforms. From television to social platforms, we want to demonstrate that advertising on Snapchat increases value to an advertiser\u2019s overall strategy. We recently collaborated with Nielsen, using their Total Ad Ratings, which allow advertisers to measure the incremental reach of their Snapchat campaigns relative to TV campaigns. Despite being outspent 25:1 by television, Snapchat campaigns were able to deliver 8% incremental reach on top of TV campaigns for the same set of brands.", "Finally, we are continuing to work with our third-party ecosystem to demonstrate ROI for all verticals. We conducted a series of custom marketing mix model studies with Nielsen to measure the effectiveness of Snapchat advertising within the beer category. The studies showed that Snapchat was more efficient than both traditional channels and other forms of digital media. Snap Ads outperformed the category media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.7 times, while Lenses and Filters outperformed the media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.3 times.", "Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and I\u2019m optimistic about the future of our business.", "Thank you for your time. I will now hand it off to Drew for a financial update.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. In the quarter, we made continued progress against our three financial goals: first, grow users and sales; second, leverage our cost structure; and third, soundly manage cash. As Imran mentioned, sales grew meaningfully year-over-year. Equally important, sales growth continues to well outpace our cost growth year-over-year.", "Over the past few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to make the right long-term decisions for our business. One of our core financial strategies was to invest early ahead of the sales curve to build the right cost structure that we could both scale with our growth and leverage over time.", "In the first quarter, we successfully leveraged our cost structure. Year-over-year sales growth was over 1.5 times our cost growth, and sequential costs were up only 1% in the quarter. On a per-user basis, ARPU increased 34% year-over-year, twice as fast as our CoRPU growth. Cost of revenue grew modestly, and operating expenses were sequentially down for the second time in three quarters, excluding restructuring charges.", "An efficient cost structure is a central part of our financial roadmap. We will continue to invest in strategic areas like innovation, new products, and people to fuel future growth. That said, we believe many of these opportunities can be funded by running our business more effectively, in areas like the back of house and hosting infrastructure. As we continue to successfully manage our cost structure, it should continue to yield two key benefits. First, we see strong incremental flow-through on revenue growth. And second, we can continue to moderate our cash burn, which we did again in Q1, as cash burn was less than half the rate from a few quarters ago.", "Let me now expand on the results for the quarter. First, global revenues were 231 million in the first quarter, and we saw growth in every region. International markets now represent 26% of our total revenue, up from 14% a year ago and 23% in Q4. Consistent with prior quarters, the fastest growing product in Q1 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold programmatically. Strength in Snap Ads more than offset softness in Creative Tools sales, which were down in the quarter.", "As expected, auction revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing. Let me share some numbers with you. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, were up over 450% year-over-year and over 15% sequentially. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Story Ads, was down nearly 65% year-over-year and nearly 20% sequentially. Third, we ended the quarter with 95% of our Snaps Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, served programmatically, up from 90% in the prior quarter.", "In the quarter, we added many new programs to the Discover page. In February, we partnered with NBC to bring the Winter Olympics to Snapchat users. We offered a series of creative ad products and packages to our advertisers, which drove incremental revenues for the business. Financially, the Olympics were a nice revenue boost, but comprised less than 10% of total revenues for the quarter.", "Now, let me talk about expenses. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures, including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Cost of revenue expenses grew $7 million in the quarter, driven by three factors. First, higher revenue share on Olympic content; second, incremental infrastructure costs related to the launch of the app redesign; and third, the addition of 4.2 million new DAUs. Hosting costs per user increased from $0.70 in Q4 to $0.73 in Q1, but hosting cost increases moderated during the quarter as our engineering team continued to optimize new code to reduce infrastructure expenses.", "On operating expenses, the primary driver remains people cost. Over the last few years, we have consistently invested to build an organization with the scale to compete. We hired over 2,400 people in the last two years and we\u2019re now digesting that rapid growth in an evolving world. As a result, during Q1 we had a 7% reduction in force, in order to better align resources around our top strategic priorities and reflect structural changes in our business.", "Consistent with earlier disclosures, the company recorded a charge of $9.9 million in the first quarter, but those charges have been adjusted out of EBITDA. We expect to realize $7 million to $8 million in ongoing savings per quarter. In the first quarter, OpEx costs were $257 million, down 1% sequentially, and overall headcount declined 3% for the period.", "Let me briefly touch on our capital-deployment priorities, which remain reinvesting in strategic areas of our business like product, content, AR, automation, and international expansion as well as opportunistic M&A. Q1 CapEx remained modest at $36 million and we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. As of March 31, 2018, total shares outstanding were 1.254 billion and 1.457 billion on a fully diluted basis.", "Let me now share some near-term observations on our business. First, as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels, with growth in auction impressions, partially offset by pricing for both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. We are planning for infrastructure costs to increase modestly in the short-term as we continue to test and rollout further changes to the application, partially offset by hosting cost efficiency programs. Revenue share expenses should moderate without Olympic content.", "We continue to plan for modest operating expense growth in the near term. Consistent with last quarter, we are planning for the first half of 2018 to grow by low double-digits versus the back half of 2017, excluding one-time charges. Please note operating expenses exclude cost of revenue, stock-based compensation, and our move to Santa Monica.", "Consistent with prior disclosures on the Venice exit, we expect to incur $25 million to $45 million in charges throughout 2018, primarily in the second and third quarters, to reflect the exit cost of these Venice buildings. The majority of these charges are cash payments due on remaining lease terms. We are planning for CapEx to be slightly elevated in the near term, as we continue our buildout of leased Santa Monica facilities and execute our move throughout 2018.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q1 expense was $143.2 million. Please note that this number included a one-time benefit of $32 million, as a result of the reduction in force plan we implemented during the quarter. We believe that the stock-based compensation rate in the second half of 2017 is a good proxy for the short-term. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Two questions, guys. One for Evan and then one for Drew. Evan, on the DAUs, it seems like anytime you guys are making changes to the Android app, you're running into some performance issues and DAUs tend to drop off. So I guess what gives you the confidence as you ship this new Android code in the second half of this year that we'll see a stabilization and when do you expect Android to use to start kind of consistently picking up.", "And then Drew, you mentioned the 2Q revenue growth will be substantially lower, so would that just be Olympics impact coming out or can you talk a little bit more specifically about the deceleration in ad revenue versus the 61% in the first quarter. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi, Ross. We should have made a lot of changes faster in our engineering organization and really put Android first. Now, and I'm starting -- last year, we started re-architecting the entire application and rebuilding it from scratch and we now have a bunch of those components and we're testing some already in the application, but ultimately it\u2019s the re-architecture that will make a big difference and I think beyond just the performance improvements that we're going to see, it will also enable our entire team to move a lot faster as we build new features. Right now, if we build a new feature, the codebase is so complex, we tend to break other things and I think reducing the complexity through modularization will make a huge difference in our ability to execute quickly on the product roadmap.", "Drew Vollero", "So Ross, as it relates to the second quarter, we were really focused on the strategic activities in business, not necessarily the near term financial targets. We're really focused on improving the redesign, improving Android, driving users to platform, driving our advertiser ROI. If you look at the platform itself at the product level, we have strength in Span Ads that direct response business is doing quite well internationally, has been a growing force as well. But look, at the end of the day, we are transitioning right now to the creative tool business Imran talked about in his opening remarks and we really are focused on being the value leader in the advertising platform and so what we're not doing is playing the pricing game to maximize short term revenues. We're really more focused on bringing advertisers to the platform and making sure advertisers have solid ROIs. There was a modest boost in the quarter as you mentioned, to Olympic revenue, which we don't expect to continue in Q2, but that's not a big piece of the story here.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mark Mahaney", "In the past, I think you've talked about crash levels on the Android app, any sort of update there as to how they're trending? And then you talked about this disruption to users. What have you seen in the quarter so far in terms of those disruptions to users, any impact on engagement? Does it seem to you like you're back to normal with your users\u2019 use of the app? Is there still a lot of experimentation just how would you address the volatility of the overall user base in response to the redesigns?", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. No specific updates on the crash levels. I do want to talk about one of the big changes that we're making to Snap, which I think will make a big difference. When we redesign the application, we combine the stories and chats from your friends onto the same page. And we like having all the stuff from your friends in one place, because it was a lot easier to find, but we didn't realize how hard it would be to optimize for those two different behaviors, talking with friends and watching their stories and it turns out it's really hard to optimize for both at the same time. So one of the biggest changes that we're making is moving stories from your friends over to the Discover page and putting it at the top of the page. So they'll still be separate from all the other content on our service, but that way your friends come first, no matter where you are in the application, but we can still optimize for watching content on one side of service and communicating with friends on the other. So that's a big change coming and we think it will make a difference.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "Great. Two things. I think in your prepared remarks, you said users were stabilizing in April, maybe you could revisit that a little bit? And then Imran, how much of the 2Q deceleration is related to the redesign and how are you thinking, you mentioned you expected a big back half, how would you think about an improvement in the back half on advertising?", "Imran Khan", "Yes. Hi. So let's take the second question first. So I think one of the things that we have done, we listen to our advertisers very closely and what are the products that they want and I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about how we will have launched reach and frequency with two advertisers. We also launching SNAP Pro, which will let people to create content and then ultimately promote those content. We are also launching lower funnel optimization for our performance advertising products. All of those things, I think, will significantly help our advertisers to take leverage of our platform. And then on top of that, what we're doing in terms of on ad ranking side by improving swipe rate and showing the right ad to the right users. And as our mission gets better and better, I think there's a lot of opportunities on that. So I'm really optimistic that I think we're doing the right thing and building the right thing.", "In terms of Evan\u2019s comment on, I think we said we are seeing early sign of stabilization on iOS.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Evan, I think at the time of the IPO one of the concerns was the need for your ad ops teams to essentially vet the creative, so that if fits in with the surrounding content and does not work against a consumer experience, but now that you are going more self-service, you have certain instances, which I guess result in the negative market creative, you touched on earlier. So it seems like there's a need to police the add creators as well, so is there a technology base or some other type of solution that can look for that type of ad content to take down? And Imran, a question on the story is the need to reformat the ad content to vertical presentations still a headwind for you? And if so, what are you doing to help advertisers either from a technology or proper perspective?", "Evan Spiegel", "Stephen. Yeah, we have a lot of empathy for the ad reviewers who work on our business. It's a tough job. We really consider them digital first responders in a sense and so we're definitely building out a lot of programs to try and help them do their jobs more effectively and we always feel terrible when mistakes are made, but we're making progress there and really we want to do our best to support the team and doing their job.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to story ad, I think what we're seeing that market is more and more embracing our format. I think 3.5 years ago, when you started the ad business, I think this full screen vertical video was very foreign to many advertisers and we heard a lot of pushback, but I think over the years, we have seen that advertisers are seeing the value of the full screen ad and the storytelling ad and we're seeing that other advertisers, other publishers also embracing these formats. So I think it is -- the headwind is getting better and I think we're also building a lot of creatives and I think one of our mission is creating friction less application experience and I think we're making a lot of progress there and we continue to invest on that technology.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "We\u2019ve seen some of the changes that you're talking about in terms of separating out stories and from Snaps and sort of the next evolution of this redesign, realize, it's extremely early, but any sort of indication in terms of how users are reacting to that. I know you're not going to go into specific metrics, but just even qualitatively what you're hearing from them? And then to the extent that we're sort of seeing pricing fluctuation, the way we are in the early innings of your moves into the programmatic, any sense sort of where pricing on any sort of like for like basis is shaking out between where Snap and other major digital platforms would be? I know it's not always easy to compare apples and oranges, but whether it's a ROI metric or price per engagement, would be curious in any benchmarking you might be able to share insight into.", "Evan Spiegel", "When we build products, we\u2019re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away, we're thinking a lot about how our products that we've built will help us accomplish our mission. So, we build things that we believe that will help us empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And so I think it's really important to understand that people think about self-expression on Snapchat in different ways. So some people would rather create content with just a small audience of their friends and other people want to create content if they have a much bigger audience because they want to reach more people. ", "And so our job is to make Snap work well for all different types of people so that we can empower people to express themselves. And with the redesign in particular, we try to make Snapchat feel more personal for people who want to use it exclusively with their friends and also more valuable for people who want to use at large audience, because we want to do both really well. So we believe the redesign brings us closer to accomplishing our mission. And we're continuing to iterate very quickly on the things that we don't like.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to pricing, we are really focused on driving advertisers ROI and bringing more and more advertisers on our platform, because when you have a lot more users, we have more choices to show to the right users. And I think we're also a new platform, so we want advertisers to learn our platform and how to win on our platform. And so fundamentally, we're not really focused on pricing right now, we are really more focused on bringing more advertisers on the platform and helping them understand our platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "I think you mentioned earlier that pricing is down 65% year-on-year and then when talking about the substantial de-sell [ph] in Q2, I think you noted that pricing is a primary driver there. I guess the question is where are we in that adjustment period and at what point do you expect that pricing will begin to stabilize? And then in terms of the redesign we\u2019re putting friends\u2019 stories above discover content, what impact do you think that that will have on engagement with commercial content and ultimately with some of the ad revenues that flow through that part of the channel.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to pricing, the 65% decline year-over-year really represents the change in selling method, we used to have a direct sales force that sold of the ads top of funnel. Now, we\u2019ve gone to programmatic, and so that's really led to the year-over-year decline. I'll echo Imran\u2019s sentiments, right now, the key activities that we're focused on are really bringing advertisers to the platform. We need a broader base of advertisers using our product and then see if really we're very focused on ROI. We do think that will be the number one metric for us in the long term success. So that's what we're focused on far more than sort of where pricing bottoms out. We don't have the near term plan for that.", "Evan Spiegel", "In terms of the Discover product, we believe that making Snapchat is the best place to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. We will build a larger audience for creators and ultimately benefit them and we\u2019re also introducing a lot of new tools this year for creators, which we believe will inspire them to continue creating great content for Snap. So ultimately, we're taking a long view here and we believe that as users experience our products, we will be able to build our audience and that will benefit creators.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Two if I can. First Imran, I think you said March average DAU is lower than 1Q average, but still up in the 4Q average, which seems to imply that maybe March ended lower than where you were in December kind of on a period end basis. Can you kind of talk about if April is down from March and then do you think the early results from moving friends\u2019 stories back to the right side of the camera does suggest that allowing help stabilize DAU?", "And then secondly, can you give us a sense for what percent of ad revenue now is coming from performance advertisers and maybe a sense of how the more sophisticated performance advertisers who have adopted the best most sophisticated tools, how they\u2019re scaling budgets plus those adoption rates. Can you maybe give us an update on the percent of at Ad Age 100 that are still spending if you will from the kind of 1Q \u201916 period, so can you give us that would be great.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I'll take from the like last question first. Look. I think we're seeing great success with a lot of the large advertisers. We strengthen our relationship with several brands like take McDonald's as an excellent example, they have pushed a multiproduct approach for nearly every campaign, always looking to test, optimize and learn with us. In fact, they were one of the first advertisers to test audience filters in action, creating seven different filters and targeting each one to a niche audience. ", "But most importantly, over the years, Snapchat has gone from being a platform that McDonald's would leverage periodically to an always on long term partners. Year over year, McDonald's grew their investment triple digit with us. So we're really pleased, we had a lot of success stories like that. We're becoming true business partner for a lot of large advertisers but at the same time we're seeing healthy growth in our performance advertising campaign. And I think we\u2019ve got great feedback from them and based on that, we're trying to bring creative tools also to the DR customers and that business is going at a very healthy rate and we're very, very excited about it.", "With regards to DAU, I think we gave you the average for the quarter was 191 million. Q4 average was 187. I believe what Evan talked about in his prepared remarks that March was lower than our Q1 average of 191, but higher than the Q4 average of 187. So that should give you a pretty good guidance where that numbers were in March.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.", "Jason Helfstein", "I wanted to dig a bit more. So for all the examples of McDonald's of triple digits, I guess how much of the weakness or relative to what we're all expecting was from advertisers who pulled back because of call it misunderstanding or questions or publicity and so the point is like what did it take to get those advertisers back. And is that -- the point being you expect those advertisers to be back in the third quarter, just go a little bit deeper into that, what caused the advertisers toward spending to pull back and what makes you -- and what gives you confidence they come back.", "Imran Khan", "Look, I think -- thanks for asking the question. At the end of the day, advertisers are rational. They want to advertise and they want to drive return on their ad spend. But at the same time, they're human. When there's a lot of negative news on the press every day, it does give people pause, it does influence people buying decisions, know it's very hard to handicap how what percentage, but that does come out on the conversation and become a disruption on the selling process. But I think the way to win is by proving otherwise, right. The examples like McDonald's or some of the examples that I shared on the call, when we go and prove that, but I just had the money that this spent and we drive value for them. ", "It's really, really important. I think one of the things that is really important to understand that the Snapchat\u2019s position in the millennial audience, right, there are over 90 million millennials in the US today and they represent the single largest generation ever defined. Millennials are expected to become a huge economic force in the coming years that already dominating lot of buying decisions. And we have a very strong position in that demographic and some of the investment that our product team and engineering team did to swing the right ad to the right audience. I think that we -- and we just need to prove those ROIs and educate the market and that's ultimately drive value for everybody.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge ", "So ad impressive growth has been significant the past several quarters, just wondering how you feel about ad loads and ability to raise ad loads and then just any update on engagement. I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it, time spent on the platform, anything there would be helpful?", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think again -- I think about the problem is ad is a piece of content and when it's a piece of content, you have to show the most relevant content to the most relevant person and that really drives the engagement, right. If I show you one content that you don't care about it, if I show you one piece of content, you will be annoyed. If I show you three great pieces of content that you really, really like and you want to engage with it, that you will like it. So I think rather than thinking about the ad load, what we have been challenging our product team and our engineering team, are we doing the best job showing the most relevant content to our users. When you do that, everybody wins. And I think one of the thing I talked about in the call that how we saw 8 percentage point increase in swipe rate. And I think that's really, really exciting and that's something I think there's a lot more work to be done and we continue to push out teams to do that. ", "In terms of time spent, I think Evan mentioned in the call that more than over 30 minutes people are due to spend on our platform, over 30 minutes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Just first you talk about self-serve helping increase the advertiser number 20x over the past year. Just curious if you\u2019ve quantified that number? And then, Imran, can you just talk more about the concept, the moving to always on spending and how much that's actually happening across the platforms at this point? And then just quickly, do you think you're seeing any impact in users from competitive entertainment like Fortnite and PUBG?", "Imran Khan", "So with regards to -- look I think in terms of number of advertisers, we launch our self-serve platform in Q2 of last year. So it's a very new platform. So we have a lot of room to grow our number of advertisers on our platform, and I think so we have a lot of work to do and we're very pleased with the growth, but we want to grow faster and there's a lot of room to grow.", "With regards to competitive pressure from other games like Fortnite, my son who is 8 years old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend, but I think it's really hard for me to sit here and predict how that's spending impacting time on our platform at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two. The first one, appreciate the color on the Snap ad versus the creative tools, the lender\u2019s growth in the quarter. Wondering, could you talk us through how we should think about the growth trajectory of those two businesses over the course of the year, maybe the relative size and just to think about the puts and takes on revenue growth between those two buckets this year?", "And the second one, you talked a lot about a focus to bring more advertisers on to the platform. Maybe talk through philosophically how has your advertiser onboarding process changed between large advertisers and SMBs. What are the keys to success going forward?", "Drew Vollero", "Good. As it relates to the product mix, we never really quantify the difference between the Snap ads and the creative tools. We gave some sense maybe a couple of years ago about the size of a business we described in a sort of a good one two combination and both very meaningful to our business. I would say with the move to programmatic over the last six to twelve months, the Snap Ads business has become a much bigger piece of our business than the creative tools. And so the Snap Ads business continues to grow. We have good traction internationally. We have good traction on the DR side of the world. So we are definitely seeing that being the engine that\u2019s fueling our growth right now. I think the creative business will continue \u2013 the creative tool business will continue to transition that as we commented on in the second quarter here, those are -- that's what we're seeing in the near term. So right now, the bulk of the revenue is being driven by the Snap ads business and that's really the engine that's going to fuel our growth in the near term.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think to add on Drew\u2019s color, I think our creative tool business also have a lot of opportunities like more recently we launched Lens Studios for example. It really democratize who can create lenses. I think one of the big challenge for a lot of the small businesses to create creative tools is that they have to work with us directly, but as the Lens Studios and those things proliferated, they have the opportunities for a lot of advertisers to embrace this creative tools business, that's also opened up new revenue opportunity for us. So I think we feel very excited about that, how we are monetizing camera and at the same time, we\u2019re monetizing content on our platform and how there are a lot more opportunities to do that. ", "With regards to your second question, how you\u2019re addressing the market, we break up ourselves in two different groups. One is DSO, direct sales organization who focus on the large advertisers and they are really a sales consultant for those. The second bucket is our global online sales team, so that has combination of inside sales and our channel partners. So we partner with other channels who actually sell on behalf of us as well. So that's how we were trying to cover across the market and educate them about the platform and to help onboard more and more advertisers on the platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Rich Greenfield", "Hi. A few questions. First just housekeeping. I wanted to follow up on the question before regarding Evan's commentary on DAUs If you look at kind of March 2018 quarter end, should we infer basically, is the inference essentially that March quarter end for \u201918 was actually below December 2017 quarter end? And then two, on product, Evan, you mentioned shifting friends\u2019 content over to the right, which I certainly understand, but part of the new right side redesign not only was it algorithmic, but it was also kind of everything. ", "So it was like one solid flowing experience where it almost felt like you got lost and you were just clicking, you have this kind of infinite array of content. Now, as you start to separate out friends from everything else, discover, kind of brand/implementers, how does that impact time spent in the discover/influencer content on the right side relative to friends? And then just a part of that, could that actually cause a disruption as you kind of shift the stories back to the right, are we looking at another potential disruption in user behavior, as people get used to that type of a change back. That would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So overall, as we look at the redesign, the thing that we're most excited about is creating this infinite scroll content. As you mentioned, in the past, the right side of the application really only had your friends\u2019 stories and a very small select group of publishers without a lot of personalization. And so I think one of the really great things that we've been able to accomplish with the redesign is putting your friends at the top, making them most important, but also still opening up into this world of personalized content below. So I think, we're going to get the best of both worlds in that sense and still create an environment where people feel empowered to express themselves.", "And I don't think we can give you any specifics on the earlier DAU question, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore.", "Anthony DiClemente", "I just wanted to follow up on that question about content. In terms of \u2013 it just sounds based on what you\u2019ve said Evan that there could be a transition and emphasis to user generated content, given the changes in the Discover tab and I guess if not, maybe just what is your forward strategy with respect to licensed professional content from here?", "And then a question for Drew, you stated in your prepared remarks that future acquisitions will likely be additive to stock-based compensation. So I'm curious what areas is Snap actively pursuing in terms of M&A and how do you think about balancing the potential M&A with your priorities around cash management from here?", "Drew Vollero", "Let me take the second one first and then I'll turn it over to Evan. Look, we've had a lot of success managing our cash burn rate over the last couple of quarters. We've reduced it by over 50%. How we've done that is we\u2019ve really focused the strategic capital deployment priorities here at the company. We're really focused on investing in our business. The M&A here will be very opportunistic. If we see the right thing at the right time at the right price, we\u2019ll go ahead and make that happen, but right now, we're focused on really the key strategic activities of growing our business around the design, around the Android, new advertisers\u2019 ROI, those are the strategic priorities in the business. If we have a chance to be opportunistic, with an acquisition, we will go ahead and do that. Historically, the acquisitions have been pretty tuck-in in nature. They've been focused more on technologies and talent than they have been sort of robust acquisitions, big companies, big business models, et cetera. So that's where we've been focused to date. And I'd look for again our strategic priorities for cash really to be the investment in the business.", "Evan Spiegel", "Ultimately, users\u2019 content has obviously been a strong suit for us for a very long time, because we're so focused on powering creativity, opening to the camera and building all these creative tools that inspire people to create. I think as we look at the redesign and the opportunity for publishers and creators, we're definitely excited about the progress we\u2019ll be able to make for both last year, we delivered $100 million in revenue to our partners and we're excited to build on that. So I think publishers will play a very important role in the future and also create more opportunities for creators and influencers to be successful on Snap.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust.", "Youssef Squali", "Two quick questions for me. First, maybe Evan, you referenced changes in market narrative as a reason for the softness. Just trying to understand kind of the other side of that is for the market narrative to change again, I'm assuming this is on the advertiser side, there is really no control necessarily in terms of timing. So you talked about how Q3 is going to be an inflection point for that, just trying to get a sense of, if advertisers have now, so to speak, put you guys in the penalty box, what kind of gives you the confidence that you can get out of it within a quarter? ", "And then on the profitability side, there were some news reports talking about how maybe you gave directives internally to accelerate dramatically accelerate the profitability of the business. First, is there any truth to that? And second, how do you look at and maybe this is a question for Drew partly as well, balance out the profitability versus the doubling down of the investments as you suggest in your prepared remarks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So in terms of profitability, obviously, building a sustainable business is what's going to allow us to pursue our mission for a really long time. So it's something we think about and I think we've made great progress over the last few years towards being able to fund our own growth. I think if we look at the big transition we made last year to our programmatic advertising business, I think the really great benefit of that is we've gotten a lot better at showing advertisers ROI, so the market narrative I think will matter less over time, as we continue to improve our measurement capabilities and to really deliver that for advertisers. So excited about the progress that we're making there. And you're right that it's important to focus on the performance business.", "Drew Vollero", "So, I will -- just to build on Evan's comments, I mean, it makes sense for us to build toward a breakeven. It's a logical next step for our business, but let's be clear, we really don't manage against that. There is no timeline to take that of the certain date. The key thing to remember is that, that's going to for us begin with growth. We need to continue to grow our user base. We need to grow our revenues. We\u2019re going to keep investing in areas like product innovation, AR and content to name a few. That said, Snap for breakeven also is going to revolve around carrying water in both shoulders for us, you have to be sensible about our cost structure. We have a moderate cost growth where it makes sense. We have a large infrastructure for a company our size. We\u2019re built for growth and you saw that in Q1 that we were able to leverage the cost structure, our cost growth was only up 1% sequentially. So there are opportunities for us to do things better and that should allow us to continue to make investments that will fuel our growth.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today's session and you may now disconnect."]}

During the first quarter, we focused our efforts primarily on the performance and quality of our Snapchat application and automation across our content products and advertising business. We're pleased with the early results from these performance and quality improvements, particularly on Android devices. These improvements helped drive a significant increase in engagement, with now over 3 billion Snaps created every day with our cameras, generating an increase in overall sessions and time spent.", "We were also able to more than double the number of net additional users coming from Android devices compared to last quarter. And Android users accounted for over 30% of net additional users this quarter, up from 20% last quarter. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're excited by the amount of progress we've made in such a short time.", "We averaged 166 million daily active users for the quarter. Worldwide net additional users in Q1 increased by 54% compared to Q4 as we continued to expand our community in North America and Europe. We also managed to make some headway in the rest of world, largely due to improvements on Android.", "Towards the end of the first quarter, we began to roll out our search product. Search is exciting for us because it begins to expose the so-called long tail of content on our service. With so many Snaps created every day, there really is a story for everything on Snapchat. Search surfaces interesting Stories created by machine learning and allows our community to find Stories for anything they might be interested in.", "We made significant progress in automating our advertising business this quarter, with more than 20% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically through our API. Automating our ads platform means that advertisers get better pricing, our community sees better ads and we're able to make more money per impression.", "Overall, I feel we have executed well on our priorities for this quarter, performance, quality and automation. Our progress this quarter should provide a strong foundation as we continue to build our business.", "With that, I will turn it over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We're very pleased with our Q1 achievements. We're really excited about the progress we have made increasing engagement across Snapchat. We believe that great advertising starts with strong user engagement. As Evan mentioned, time spent for our users continues to grow. On average, in Q1 our users spent over 30 minutes per day on Snapchat. This increase is largely because of the unique content on our platform.", "Snapchat offers exclusive content from several perspectives, friends and family, our global community and premium publishers. With user Stories, Snapchatters see the world through the eyes of their friends and family. Our community creates and sends billions of Snaps every day as a fun and easy way to communicate and stay up to date with their closest friends.", "With our Stories, Snapchatters stay informed and connected to the world around them. This past quarter, we told over 450 Our Stories in over eight languages to our global community. Our expert teams curate Snaps submitted by Snapchatters around the world's biggest moments, such as breaking news, entertainment and sports.", "In February, Our Story coverage of the Oscars received over 250,000 submissions from Snapchatters. This allowed us to curate multi-perspective stories full of unique content that is exclusive to our platform. Over 21 million global unique viewers tuned in to watch our Oscars coverage, indicating to us that the power of these stories is resonating with our community.", "With publisher's Stories, Snapchatters engage with premium content curated by some of the most credible media companies in the world. We expanded our offerings in Q1 by launching nine new partners in the U.S. and one in Norway. This brings us to a total of 55 global partners as of Q1 2017.", "We work with Nielsen on custom analysis on Snapchat's unique daily reach in the U.S., when Nielsen found that 45% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are reached by Snapchat on any given day. This is nine times more than the average daily reach of the top 15 TV networks and nearly 5 times more than the top TV network.", "Additionally, 87% of our U.S. daily active users between the ages of 18 and 34 cannot be reached by any top 15 TV network. Our platform allows us to engage an audience that research shows is difficult to reach. We believe that the ability to deliver this type of reach and engagement is the cornerstone of a great advertising business.", "Now I would like to share some of the progress we have made to benefit advertisers in three key areas, one, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and, three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. We started our advertising business by servicing big brands. This strategy proved invaluable. These partners have high standards and provided great feedback that shaped our priorities. Universal Pictures was our first advertiser in the fall of 2014. Since then, they have challenged us to find unique and effective ways to reach the right audience for each campaign. We have been a go-to partner for nearly every single title, helping them across a variety of objectives. From 2015 to 2016, Universal more than doubled their spend with us which we feel is a testament to the returns they have seen on their early investment.", "And we continue to listen and develop new solutions to serve our advertisers. By listening to our partners, we learned that advertisers are hungry for more effective direct response advertising solutions. This meant enhancing our Snap Ad brand's experience with interactive capabilities which we call Snap Ads with Attachments. Attachments help advertisers accomplish specific goals by providing a way for users to engage with a Snap Ad.", "For example, a user who watches a Snap Ad for a new Hollywood movie can swipe up to view the full trailer or buy a ticket, all without leaving Snapchat. I would like to share a couple of examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments are driving value for our performance advertisers.", "Acorns, a micro investing app, partnered with us on an app install campaign to drive both brand awareness and app installs. With this campaign we delivered a 300% increase in app installs. Fullscreen also continues to partner with us on various direct response initiatives. They consistently see higher active viewing rates from users who come in via Snap Ads compared to other platforms. And each time we collaborate together, they continue to see lower costs per acquisition.", "We have designed our ad products to work well on their own or when used together in integrated campaigns. We have many advertisers that now leverage Snapchat with an always-on strategy.", "Throughout Q1, Snapchat was a strategic mobile partner to Anheuser-Busch's core brands, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra and Busch. Anheuser-Busch leveraged Snapchat as an always-on video partner, utilizing all of our ad products for a variety of initiatives. This included sports partnership like NFL, MLB and NASCAR, as well as holidays and tent-poles, like St. Patrick's Day.", "L'Oreal U.S.A is another great example. They have made us an always-on part of their strategy, augmenting Lens and Geofilter executions with Snap Ads. L'Oreal U.S.A has taken advantage of Snapchat's premium, contextually relevant publisher content in combination with advanced targeting in user Stories, to keep their brands top of mind with customers.", "The second area we have focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We want to make it easy and painless for both the largest brands and the smallest local businesses to advertise on Snapchat. This includes how advertisers buy, create and manage their ads. We're still in the early stages of building these tools and we're making good progress.", "In Q1 2016, we launched our on-demand Geofilters tool or ODG. To date we have tens of thousands of advertisers creating and managing their own geofiltered campaigns. This past quarter, we launched line of credit for ODG to make it even easier for all advertisers to buy ads.", "Our most significant step was with the launch of our API and auction in Q4 of last year. We have been working hard to scale our auction to make it something valuable to advertisers of all sizes. Today, our API is live in 24 countries and serving some of the world's largest brands in addition to small and medium-sized businesses.", "Last week we announced our first Snap Ads self-service product, called Snapchat Ad Manager. Our goal is to put the power of our ad products into the hands of every advertiser, regardless of their size. This tool supports all of our ad products, targeting capabilities; and goal-based auction solutions which allows advertisers to bid for swipes or bid for app installs.", "The third area of focus is proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Delivering metrics and proving ROI to advertisers has been a massive area of progress over the past 12 months. Today we have 13 different third-party measurement partners and this list will continue to grow. We also invested heavily in Snap to Store, our own first-of-its-kind measurement offering. Snap to Store allows advertisers to measure foot traffic and demographics for Snapchatters after they see ads on our platform. These kind of location-based online to off-line measurement is a strength for Snapchat and in many ways a Holy Grail of ad measurement.", "During the 2016 holiday season, Hollister ran a Snap Ads campaign. And within seven days of seeing the ad, Snap to Store found that over 63,000 incremental Snapchatters visited a Hollister store nationally.", "Overall, we're excited about the progress we have made as we scale our advertising business. We have a lot of work to do in the rest of 2017 and look for -- to what's ahead.", "Thanks, everyone, for the time. And now I will hand it over to Drew.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Growth in new users, engagement and year-over-year revenues highlighted our first quarter results. Revenues grew 286% year-over-year to $149.6 million, driven primarily by strong advertiser demand. Revenues in North America were $128.7 million in the first quarter, up 259% year-over-year. In Europe, revenues were $13.1 million, up 385% year-over-year. Rest of world revenues were $7.8 million, up from only a couple hundred thousand dollars, a year ago.", "Sequentially, first quarter revenues were down 10% compared to Q4 2016. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the expected seasonality from advertising which comprises the bulk of our revenues.", "Snap sold revenue was $129 million, approximately 86% of total revenues. Partner sold revenue was $12.3 million and other revenues were $8.3 million, primarily driven by Spectacles. Total revenues outside North America for Q1 were 14% of sales, up from 7% of sales, a year ago. Average revenue per user or ARPU, was $0.90 in the first quarter, up from $0.32 a year ago but sequentially lower than Q4.", "We believe North America remains a leading indicator for the scale potential of our business. North American ARPU was $1.81, more than double our global average which was up 170% versus last year. Both Snap Ads and Creative Tools were meaningful revenue drivers for the business. New products like the API were also key revenue drivers in Q1.", "Now turning to expenses, we have two primary cost components, cost of revenue and operating expenses. Please note that when I discuss these expense figures, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of hosting costs and revenue share expenses. Operating expenses are driven by headcount costs. We utilize third parties to provide our infrastructure. This strategy has allowed us to focus on product innovation while we leverage their expertise, their capital and their operating efficiencies. We estimate this capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures to date, while delivering competitive daily costs to serve our users.", "In the quarter, we made good progress against our hosting costs in two key areas. First, we started to migrate to a dual cloud environment using both Google and Amazon to host our infrastructure. And second, we signed new contracts with each provider which lowered costs for most of our key services. As such, hosting expenses fell 12% in the quarter sequentially, down from $113 million to $99 million. These savings more than offset the increases we incurred from growing engagement.", "Relatedly, total cost of revenue fell sequentially $10.3 million or 6%, driven by those hosting savings, partially offset by revenue share expenses which grew slightly. Revenue share expenses increased by shifting the structure of certain revenue share contracts from variable to fixed fee arrangements which raised costs in the quarter but could create leverage as the year progresses and as revenues expand.", "As mentioned, cost of revenue is closely linked to our capital expenditures. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $18 million and were primarily spent on the expansion of our global office footprint. Capital expenditures were $20.4 million in Q4 2016, so Q1 expenses were down 12% sequentially.", "Operating expenses increased 18% sequentially to $196.2 million in the first quarter. We continue to invest in acquiring engineering talent and scaling our global operations. Expenses related to headcount were over 75% of total operating expenses in the quarter. We ended the quarter with 2,360 employees, up from 1,859 at the end of 2016.", "Our financial strategies for operating expenses are threefold, first, to continue to invest in engineering and sales; second, to leverage G&A expenses; and, third, to moderate overall cost growth per head. In the quarter, we made progress against all three goals. 90% of our new hires were in engineering and sales. Additionally, G&A expenses fell from 39% to 32% of total operating expenses. And third, operating expenses per head declined 7% sequentially. Our overall business remains in investment mode.", "Scale operations related to recruiting and facilities are incurred upfront while monetization occurs more gradually. As such, nominal losses increased in the quarter.", "GAAP net loss was $2.2 billion for the quarter which included the expected stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $2 billion as a result of our IPO. Stock-based compensation expense was significantly higher than prior periods due to two factors. First, the recognition of expenses related to RSUs for which the performance condition was triggered by the completion of our IPO in March. And second, an award granted to our CEO which we expensed in its entirety during the quarter.", "Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2017 RSUs at the end of Q1 is $1.3 billion, expected to be recognized over a period of slightly more than three years, of which about half of that expense we expect to recognize during the remainder of 2017. RSUs granted during 2017 will be an additional expense.", "Adjusted EBITDA loss was $188.2 million in Q1 2017, compared to a loss of $152.3 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $93.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total shares outstanding at the end of Q1 was 1,179 million and 1,432 million on a fully diluted basis.", "We remain in a strong cash position. Cash and marketable securities increased sequentially from $987.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily from the proceeds of our IPO in early March. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Product innovation and execution remain top priorities for 2017.", "I'll now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.", "Mark Mahaney", "Two sets of questions. Drew, would you care to comment at all about how to think about DAU growth near term through the balance of the year? And any commentary on when we could see peak EBITDA losses?", "And then, Evan, if you think about the product roadmap, are there particular areas you think that we as investors should focus on? I know you mentioned a couple of improvements you made to the Android platform. Other -- on the Apple side, are there particular new features that have been rolled out recently or are about to be rolled out that you think could be meaningful in terms of user and engagement growth? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. I'd love to speak a little bit to the DAU question, because it's a question that we get all the time. And I think one of the reasons why it's such a popular question is because there's a lot of this thing in our industry called growth hacking, where you send a lot of push notifications to users or you try to get them to do things that might be unnatural or something like that.", "And I think while that's the easy way to grow daily actives quickly, we don't think that those sorts of techniques are very sustainable over the long term. And I think that can ultimately impact our relationship with the customer.", "And so I can give an example where if we had just in the beginning encouraged Snapchatters to add all their friends in the contact book instead of just a few of them, they might feel really uncomfortable creating Snaps and adding them to their Story, because they wouldn't know who was actually watching.", "So, ultimately, I think the way that we try to help people understand how we think about daily active user growth is really through the lens of creativity and creation, because we built our entire business on creation.", "So one of the things I think we've talked about a lot is this idea that anytime someone creates a Snap, they typically either send it to their friend which brings that friend into the Snapchat ecosystem; or they add it to their Story which obviously contributes to time spent as they provide that content to all their friends.", "And so, I think the most important thing to understand is that really we think of this daily active user growth as a function or a derivative of the growth in creation. And so we're really excited about the momentum there.", "And then I think we also talked about two things that are really important to the growth of our service. The first is affordable cell service, broadband cell service and decent to high-end smartphones. So historically we've really focused our efforts on markets where both of those are available because we can really deliver value through our products that way. So I think we think, over time, as connectivity grows, that more people will be able to use our products and really get value from them.", "So the last thing I will say is that the way we talk about DAU growth in our Company really as it pertains to creativity is about removing friction from the creative process. So we've talked about Lenses which I think are a great product. And the reason why I think that that prompted such an explosion in creativity is because it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service, because people enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that.", "So another example we gave recently was the improvements to our Android product. And so I think the more we're able to reduce friction from the creative process by improving the way our camera works in terms of Creative Tools and also just functionality, more people will feel empowered to express themselves. And I think we believe that that translates to DAU growth.", "Drew Vollero", "Mark, as it relates to your question on guidance, whether it's DAUs or peak EBITDA losses, we're going to run the Company here for the long term. We want the flexibility to make the right decision in the long term. So we're not going to be short sighted about profit decisions to make a quarter or whatever that would end up being. So at this point, there is not going to be any financial guidance coming from Snap.", "Mark Mahaney", "Thank you, Evan. Thank you, Drew.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Evan, just one follow-up on the DAU and then one for either Imran or Drew. So it sounded like the Android activations are picking up. So I guess the question is, why isn't the rest of world region keeping pace with maybe the historical trend that you've seen in that geo or what you're seeing right now in North America and Europe, with around 3 million added each quarter?", "And then do you expect that to pick up at some point in the future? And any color -- you guys just launched the World Lenses product about a month ago, so any initial read on how that uptake has been going. And that I have one follow-up.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So I think the connectivity issue is a real problem in the developing world, because it really changes the use case of our service and the behavior of people that use Snapchat.", "So, for example, in certain developing world markets, people tend to use their Wi-Fi at home or in an Internet Cafe because the broadband cell service is so expensive. And what that means is that you can't use Snap to communicate in the moment. You have to go use Snap at a wireless Cafe. And that turns Snap into much more of a broadcast, lean back kind of service.", "And so I think we can invest in growing those sorts of products in those markets. But the way that our service works, I think, is by empowering this sort of visual communication. And that is just really tough if you don't have cell service wherever you go.", "Ross Sandler", "Got it, okay. And then the question for Imran or Drew is just on the revenue breakdown. The $150 million, can you just -- Drew, you mentioned that both the Creative Tools and Snap Ads were growing rapidly. Can you just give us a little sense on how much of that came from those two buckets and where we're today on ad load for discover?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think -- look, we built the best mobile ad product. I fundamentally believe that. If you look at our Snap Ad product, they are full screen; they play with sound. And if you look at our sponsored Creative Tools -- those are the Lenses and Filters -- people are actually putting it on their pictures and videos and sharing with their friends. So they are -- that actually has very superior ROI that we have seen with many, many advertisers. And both of those sponsored Creative Tools and our Snap Ads are contributing meaningful revenue. We're not breaking those down at this point.", "With regards to ad load, look, we're very, very early days. If you look at -- as Evan mentioned, we now have more than 3 billion Snaps get created on our platform. I talked about how we have our average users are spending 30 minutes -- more than 30 minutes on our platform. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of ad load.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "I have one for Evan and one for Imran, if I can. Evan, when you think about the creative process behind product development, how much of this focus is really on products for your core audience versus products perhaps for a more mass audience, including older demographics? Maybe you can give us a sense of what you're seeing from those folks in terms of today and what products might be in the pipeline that appeal more to older audiences.", "And then, Imran, wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of adoption around the self-service platform and in particular around direct response versus brand advertisers. Do you see evidence that the mix is increasingly shifting more to the DR side? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of the way we develop product, the important thing to understand is that we're always trying to do our best to build products that are universally appealing. So things like talking with pictures or telling Stories, those are the things that we really believe are universally appealing.", "Although we do tend to market our products directly to younger people because, frankly, they are more interested in learning how to use new technology products. And that's sort of -- is partly inspired by trying to teach my grandma how to use email; and she'd really prefer to just talk on the phone. So I think now a lot of grandparents are using email, but 20 years ago it was a little different.", "And so I think, over time, that strategy has worked for us. This quarter, the 25-plus demo, time spent in sessions are up and it continues to be a larger portion of our audience. So I really do believe we've done a good job delivering products with universal appeal, even if they are initially adopted by people who are excited about new ways to use cameras and communicate.", "Imran Khan", "Yes and with regards to self-service, our journey for self-service started in October of last year when we launched our API. Now we have 24 API partners. And in Q1, 20% of our Snap Ad impressions were served through the API platform. So that is pretty -- we're very pleased with that adoption within six months of launching the product.", "And the self-service, we announced last week that we make it available. We're very excited about the initial reaction and excitement about this product. It will be broadly available first week of June, so I think it's too early to comment about it.", "With regards to DR versus brand, I think we took a deliberate approach to start our business with the brand advertising. And the reason is we've listened -- we heard from our advertisers that there was not enough good solutions for brand advertising on the mobile. And a lot of the brand advertisers are also the very large advertisers and they have very high standards. So I think by proving the ROI to the large brand advertisers, we have been able to create a very good, strong, mobile app product on the marketplace.", "We have been making great progress on the DR side. In the call, I talked about the example of Acorn where they saw a 300% increase; or Fullscreen were testing very healthy customer acquisition costs. We're seeing more and more DR customers adopting our platform and seeing great result.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.", "Eric Sheridan", "Maybe two, both around long term strategy and shorter term, as well, on the hardware side. Evan, would love to get your sense of how you think about hardware that needs to be made by Snap itself versus leveraging, especially areas like AR and VR that we might see from third parties, sort of a follow-up on Mark's question from earlier. And then one around the financials. With the step-down in revenue quarter over quarter, Q1 over Q4, is there any way you could call out the impact that Spectacles might have had in that step-down, quarter over quarter? Thanks, guys.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of our hardware strategy, our approach when we're exploring new technology is to usually work on it ourselves. So if you remember back even when we started building Publisher Stories, we really created a lot of our own content. And that's usually the best way for us to explore something really, really quickly and really learn from it. And so that's been our strategy.", "Today with Spectacles, I think it's been really exciting to see people capture memories from their perspective. There's obviously something really exciting about that. Over, I guess, 5 million Snaps have been created with Spectacles to date. And so I think we're going to keep experimenting there. And then at some point obviously, I think as we've shown with our other products, we like being a good partner and I think that's always an interesting avenue to explore.", "Drew Vollero", "So, financially, Eric, on the Spectacles side again, we launched the Spectacles.com website during the quarter. It's a modest program for us right now. We report that in other revenue. We don't break out Spectacles, per se, but it was a little more than $8 million for the quarter.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "I had two; first one for Imran. Can you just talk about what kind of content you're looking for on the Snap platform and how you ensure that you get the discoverability of that video or content in what's becoming a more crowded discover tab?", "And then second, drew, just understanding that there's seasonality, of course, in 1Q in brand spending. You're also just very early in your trajectory. But is there anything else to think about here as we go through 2017, in terms of seasonal or other kinds of comp issues through the year? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I'd actually love to take this opportunity to talk a little more broadly about our content strategy in general. The simple answer to the discoverability problem for our publishers to date has been really the application of machine learning which has really helped us show the right content to the right person in terms of the Publisher Stories content.", "But I think more broadly, we have really three great types of content on our service. The first obviously, the user Stories product that we initially created where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and they don't feel like they're part of a popularity contest. And I think that product has been really terrific.", "And I think after that, obviously, we developed Publisher Stories. And Publisher Stories I think are really interesting because we were able to really create an ecosystem that works where publishers have an incremental audience where they can monetize their content; but also build a relationship with the customers that are viewing that content that we've seen also impact their business outside of the Snap ecosystem. And that relationship is really, really important to us. And we have a loyalty metric that we share with those partners because I think they've really been able to build a relationship on Snap.", "And then I think the last one that's really fun for us and is really a new one, are the new Stories that are being created in our search product. And that's really exciting because people all over the world are experiencing really fun things. And just by contributing their Snap to Our Story, we do all the hard work on the back end to basically collect all these perspectives together, compile them into interesting Stories that everyone can enjoy. So I think this is yet another type of relationship that's being built on Snap where people around the world are seeing things from new perspectives.", "So, I think, broadly speaking, the content strategy is working well. And then I think we have some other things we're interested in, in building on in the future.", "Drew Vollero", "On the second part of your question, obviously the business is scaling quite rapidly. We were up 286% year-over-year, if you look at the revenues. As you look at the back half of the year, obviously we're building an international business. We have a salesforce now that's really starting to get traction.", "There were a couple of the events in the back half of 2016 from a seasonal perspective. We did have the Olympics in the third quarter of 2016. That was a nice bump for us. And then in the fourth quarter, we have good partnerships with college football and the NFL on the sporting side. And so you can think about that a little bit. There also was a little bit of election upside, as well, in 2016.", "But, overall, the business is just in a very different place in terms of the resources and the size of the reach that we have right now with the salesforce.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two; the first one to Evan. There is very strong engagement and time spent on the platform, but the ad deceleration was pretty steep. You talked about removing friction in engagement. I'd be curious to hear about what are the main points of friction that you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars onto the platform? What excites you most to fix that over the next couple years? And then on discover, can you just talk about the type of engagement or user adoption you're seeing on discover and what are the main ways you can drive faster discover adoption? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, sure. I think the big issue with advertising over the next decade or so, frankly, is going to be education. I think we have world-class ad units. They are delivering ROI. We've done a lot of work this year to build out the measurement side of the business. And so I think now really it's an education process and I think early adopters are seeing great results. And so we've just got to keep showing people how Snap can really work for them and drive ROI.", "And then -- sorry. As far as the discover content is concerned, I think one of the things we're really excited about is our new Shows product. I don't know if you had a chance to see it, but basically it is total -- it is content created just for Snap. So rather than a lot of the video content you're seeing I think on mobile right now which is repurposed from TV or repurposed from the Internet, we've worked with some really outstanding partners to create some awesome shows.", "And I think right now, we have about one show a day. I think that will grow through the end of the year. And these are episodes like -- Second Chance, I think what was on today; and these are the types of shows that are drawing audiences over 8 million. So we're excited about that.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Imran, it seems like you have around 11 office locations right now around the globe. It seems like the vast majority of those are in the U.S., as well as the English-speaking countries. So, when can we start to see you guys start to go more aggressively after the other large ad markets in Continental Europe and elsewhere, so that we will start seeing the monetization gap between North America and Europe close? It seems like the users are catching up, but the revenue in Europe still seems to be about 1/10th of what you're reporting in North America right now. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're very pleased with our international growth. I think if you look at in Q1, 14% of our revenue came from international market. That is up from 7% a year ago. I think we're still early on with many market, like for example in Germany, we're just getting started. We're just getting started in Nordic markets and Netherlands and things like that. So I think as we continue to expand more sellers in those markets and continue to invest, I think you will see international continue to grow as a percentage of revenue.", "Stephen Ju", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.", "Ron Josey", "I just wanted to drill a little bit more into self-service, with 20% of ads delivered through the API in the first quarter and then the pending launch of the ads manager, can you just talk about the roadmap for self-service? The tools appear to be there with support across the ad formats and want to know if Lenses is included. And then how do you manage the channel conflict between Snap's salesforce and an ad manager? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think the -- first of all, 20% of Snap, that is what flowed through the API, not Lenses and Filters. And I think what we're really committed to that it is make it very easy for any advertisers to buy a Snapchat ad. And I think a lot of the large advertisers also want to use our self-service platform because they want to try out different creatives; they want to get more real-time result. And as well as a lot of small businesses who doesn't necessarily have access to sellers or agencies -- they also want to try it out.", "And I think what you will see us that over the next year or two and on an ongoing basis, is a continued investment to make it as frictionless as possible for everybody to buy ad on our platform.", "And with regards to channel conflict, the way we manage our channel conflict is the sellers have their clienteles and we got list that clienteles what platform and how they buy ads on the platform; they get credited towards that. So we have a pretty good -- we feel very good about the channel conflict management on that.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.", "Scott Devitt", "I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about geographic mix in terms of user growth. North America and Europe continue to outperform rest of world in terms of absolute DAU adds and how to think about that throughout 2017 and future years. And then secondly, just a clarification on the Spectacles revenue that Eric asked about earlier. Could you give the number of -- for Spectacles in 4Q? And then also in 1Q just to make sure -- understood what that $8 million was -- which quarter that was in. Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Yes, on the Spectacles side, just as a quick clarification, other revenue in the fourth quarter was I think a little bit more than $4.5 million. And so the numbers I gave earlier to Eric were first quarter other revenues were a little bit more than $8 million. So that will give you a little context. And really the program began in the fourth quarter.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as far as DAU growth, we're going to continue to focus on North America and Europe where we think we can deliver the most value for customers, based on their devices and the network. And longer term, obviously, we really believe that Snapchat is for everyone. And it's just early days for us, so we're focused in North America and Europe first.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge", "Two questions. Evan, in terms of the upcoming product roadmap, could you maybe discuss what you're excited about and perhaps how you see the cadence of product innovations progressing throughout the course of the year?", "And then maybe for Imran, you mentioned Universal doubled ad spend, 2016 versus 2015. Just your thoughts on ad demand in the U.S. in 1Q -- were you pleased with it? And then how is ad demand trending, thus far in 2Q? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "So I think at this point, we're kind of famous for not giving guidance on the product pipeline. But we're obviously really excited about it and we love surprising our community; so should be a fun rest of the year.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to ad business in Q1, I was very pleased with our Q1 ad performance. And I think, as you know, that our business has more focus on brand advertisings. That's how we got started and the brand business is very seasonal. But if by that on a year-over-year basis our business grew 286% on a year-over-year basis.", "And we continue to invest in both DR and brand and continue to make the advertising business as frictionless as possible which will help us to onboard many, many advertisers on the platform which should bode well for our future advertising business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "On the DAU number, can you unpack for us a little bit? A DAU, daily active user, is obviously an incredibly high bar. Can you unpack for us a little bit how much of the growth came from adding additional users to the platform versus engaging -- increasing engagement on the platform? And then from an advertising perspective, was there any impact to the quarter from changes in the sales organization or any sort of disruption there that you felt like would have allowed the Company to potentially grow advertising faster, had you seen more stability in the quarter?", "Imran Khan", "Look, I'm not sure what sales organization change you are mentioning; but I think we continue to grow our sales organization and continue to add a lot more people in the organization. And that continues to do very well. I think we're very fortunate to hire a lot of great talent in the organization throughout the quarter. And I think the salesforce is -- remained really very focused. And I'm very pleased with the execution we're doing. Evan, do you want to take DAU?", "Evan Spiegel", "I think we talk a lot about DAU as an engagement metric. Obviously we provided a couple extra metrics this quarter, like time spent which is over 30 minutes. And obviously an overall increase in sessions on a per user basis, so those are things we're excited about. And as I mentioned, I think the more that we can remove friction from this creative process, the more people want to use our service. And that's our strategy.", "Heath Terry", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Mark Zuckerberg opened up F8 essentially saying that they are now a camera company with an augmented reality API designed to let the whole world in and innovate. And while he didn't ever say it directly, it really sounded like he wants to bury Snapchat. So, I think the question that's on every investor's mind is does Facebook scare you, why or why not? And then I have a follow-up for Imran.", "Evan Spiegel", "Look, I think if there's one thing that I'd want to communicate today, it's probably just the overall importance of creativity to our business. And I mean this from every perspective, from the team that we hire to how they work together; the creative culture that we have; the products that we have that inspire people to create. And I think our overall strategy, obviously which is to deliver value through creativity. And I think the bottom line is, like, if you want to be a creative company you've got to get comfortable with and basically enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your products if you make great stuff.", "And I think we've seen this happen a lot in technology. When Google came along, everyone really felt like they needed a search strategy. When Facebook came along, everyone felt they needed a social strategy. And now I think with Snap, with our company, we believe that everyone is going to develop a camera strategy. Because I think we really help people understand how valuable the camera is, because it's really the center of everything that we do. And I think, at the end of the day, just because Yahoo, for example, has a search box, it doesn't mean they are Google.", "Richard Greenfield", "So just to follow up on the advertising side, either for you, Evan or for Imran. Why should an advertiser, just given the magnitude of the scale of Facebook versus Snapchat -- not to mention the advertising tools -- why advertise on Snapchat versus just dumping more money into Facebook?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, I think a bunch of reasons. Number one, we have incremental audience that we talked about. Number two, we're created -- I would argue that probably the best mobile ad product on the marketplace which is what many, many, many of our advertisers are seeing, superior ROI.", "Third, I think, fundamentally, advertisers want to advertise in many different platforms so that they can reach the -- advertise at different context. And fourth, we also have a very difficult to reach audience and a very, very engaged audience, as we talked about in my prepared remarks. All advertising starts with a strong engagement and we provide incredibly strong engagements. An average user is spending more than 30 minutes on the platform. So all of those reasons I think is very, very attractive to advertisers to be on our platform.", "Richard Greenfield", "Thank you for the answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "Just a DAU question again. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on the month-to-month trends, how you exited the quarter and early Q2. And maybe just remind us a little bit of the seasonality of your user growth and user engagement.", "And then in terms of host costs per DAU, I was under the impression those were largely a function of engagement. But you said that that wasn't necessarily the case in Q1. You talked about some savings from what you're doing on the partner and side. Should we expect that those kind of savings to continue at least for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, in terms of guidance, we don't want to give intra quarter guidance. As you know that advertising business is a seasonally -- seasonal business, where Q1 is seasonally weaker. And so our business will continue to face seasonality that we see on the broader advertising market. With regards to -- I think one of the things I keep want to highlight that I have been feeling very strongly about our ad business. Again, I think in addition to the ROI we're driving for advertisers, we're also providing a lot of powerful location data. So people Snapchat as a messaging app and people open the app many times. You see a lot incredible amount of location data and that's also very, very valuable. That's also driving a very strong ROI for everything -- in addition to everything I just talked about.", "So we feel very good about our advertising business. And beyond that, I can't really comment specific to the quarter.", "Mark May", "I was talking about the DAU seasonality, how to think about that in Q2 and seasonality combined with how you exited the quarter DAU. Seasonality.", "Imran Khan", "Again, I think if you look at our business, our user growth was driven by innovation. And as we continue to improve the performance and quality, that also driving the DAU growth. And I think in terms of beyond that, I don't think we should think too much about seasonality on that.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to cost of revenue and your question, cost of revenue was $141 million in the quarter. $99 million of it is hosting costs. Another $23 million is revenue share, so those really are the two primary components of what drive it.", "Hosting costs are paid directly to our third-party infrastructure providers. We have primary business with Google and we've also brought Amazon over as well recently. There are a series of headwinds and tailwinds in that business. Growing engagement, to your point and new users cost us more because they are variable cost contracts. The more that consumers use our app -- the more that they open it, the more that they Snap on in, they more they download content, the more that we incur charges.", "So in terms of the prices that we pay for those services, because we signed two new contracts, we got lower prices with both of those providers. And so that provided a significant tailwind for us. And it really was the upside that you saw in sequential costs. Our costs went from $113 million last quarter to $99 million there. And that is in a quarter where we saw significant growth in engagement in some of the main attributes as well as we saw the user growth. You can see we added another 8 million users in the quarter.", "So it really was that offset in pricing that we got from the two contract providers that really drove hosting costs lower. And revenue share is a piece of that. Revenue share was up slightly in the quarter. We had restructured a couple of deals. They are now more fixed-fee deals as opposed to percentage of revenue deals. Those will give us leverage if we're able to grow sales in the back half of the year; but, in the short term, raised our expenses in the first quarter.", "Mark May", "And I guess my question is as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, are you -- is host costs going to more than closely align with DAU and engagement growth? Or some of these cost savings from the new contract is going to continue to be a tailwind for the next couple of quarters?", "Drew Vollero", "The contractual pricing is, going forward, we signed a five-year deal with each of the companies, so it's new pricing that goes forward from this point. As it relates to where it all comes out, as I said, there is a series of headwinds and tailwinds. It really is a function, first and foremost, about engagement and how much engagement happens on the site and how many users that we add. Those really are what drive the costs. In terms of the year-over-year changes in the contract, the contract does have lower prices for our key services as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "A couple questions. Get a lot of questions on competition, so wondering if you can comment at all on churn as you look at your user base in Q4 or Q1. Any notable changes there, either Android or Apple platforms, would help us understand if competition is having any impact.", "And then on advertisers, just any thoughts on -- we saw the sequential decline, but how did you do on adding new advertisers in the first quarter? Did your total number of advertisers grow sequentially in Q1? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Overall, especially in the last half of last year, we had a really tough time with Android. That's still showing up in the numbers, as we mentioned. We added -- roughly 20% of our net adds from Android in Q4 and 30% in Q1. So we're making progress. But it's taking time and we're definitely digging out of a performance hole on Android. The low-hanging fruit, I would say, has been tackled in this past quarter, but we're making some larger structural changes that I think will make a big difference on Android over time.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, with regards to advertising, as we're -- continue to educate the market, one thing to keep in mind there our ad business -- we really start monetizing our business. The first ad ran on Snapchat in Q4 of 2014 and our ad business is still very, very nascent. So as we continue to educate the market, expand the sales force, opening new market, we continue to see more and more advertisers coming to our platform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel.", "Brian White", "Evan, I wonder if you could comment a little bit about the smartphone market. More smartphones are going to come with 3D sensors. It's going to support more AR activities. So I'm wondering how we should think about this as either a threat or an opportunity for Snap. So that's one question. Second question is just long term thoughts on China and also on Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Obviously all these improvements and sensors, et cetera, are really exciting for us and obviously fun to play with. The tough thing with any of these sort of device-specific improvements is that they are really hard for all of our community to enjoy. So instead, we've really invested in building a lot of our own technology that works well with a single camera. So you see that technology in World Lenses; it looks simple, but that surface detection is tricky to do with single-camera devices. And so we invested a lot in making these next-generation AR products available to our user base. But, yes, obviously always excited about new technology.", "And then -- sorry, the second question?", "Brian White", "Just on China. The long term thoughts on China and Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, thanks. Sorry about that. In terms of China, we've learned so much from the Chinese market. In the very early days, Tencent invested in our business and we had the chance to spend a lot of time with them. We've always been in awe, frankly, of the innovation happening over there. And that's really as far as our relationship with China has progressed today. But we've invested in building out some engineering there and obviously it's really exciting for our business.", "And then Japan -- obviously a great market and we've been working more recently to develop content that specifically appeal -- Lenses and Creative Tools that appeal specifically to the Japanese market. So that's a market we're excited about over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Maybe a quick one on the infrastructure side of things. You mentioned the deals with Google and Amazon. Maybe thinking about how you feel about the interchangeability between the two services. When you think about how you engineer, do you build stuff in a modular fashion so you can quickly move it over from one cloud to another? And any color or comments around that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, the thing you're talking about, sort of like containerization, I think is definitely the long term goal with products like this. But the interesting thing about the state of the cloud market today is really how these different providers have entered the market.", "So you have AWS which was really created because Amazon was trying to meet the needs of their customers around Christmastime. They built all this excess capacity and then rented it out. And Google, obviously, who has entered the market and they have a totally different and very specific use case around search.", "And so what ends up happening is that both of these companies build different services. And so, for example, recently we've moved some of our operations to an Amazon data store that's a little bit less redundant than a Google data store, for example, but saves us a bunch of money. So right now, I think we're really picking and choosing the different products we want to use based on the offerings from the two providers.", "But I do think, yes, long term, obviously, the dream for the cloud is this idea of containerization. And that's something we continue to invest in, but that -- that's a sort of a step-by-step, not an overnight kind of thing.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ms. Sam Stewart, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Sam Stewart", "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagements and financial metrics for the second quarter of 2017 which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our second quarter 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement.

We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

This additional detail may be one-time in nature and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Good afternoon and welcome to our Q2 earnings call, we made a lot of great progress this quarter. Snapchaters now visit more frequently, spend more time and create more snaps than ever before, both in aggregate and on per user basis. Daily active user growth remains solid with 173 million people using Snapchat every day on average during the quarter an increase of 4.4% from Q1. ", "User growth was especially strong in North America with 4 million net additional users since last quarter. We also reached and important milestone in our core markets with over 25% of smartphone users in the U.S., UK and France now using Snapchat every day. Monetization is also progressing nicely although we are still in very early stages as we continue to build out our self-service and programmatic infrastructure. ", "Quarterly revenue increased 153% year-over-year to 181.7 million. Adoption of our ad platform is increasing with more than half of our all Snap ad impressions delivered through our self-service platform and our API this quarter. As our automated capabilities improve, we are running more campaigns from more advertisers resulting in a greater variety of ads on our platform. This enables us to build a robust auction and drive more relevant ads yielding better results for our advertisers and a better experience for our community. Additionally, this auction allows advertisers to optimize their campaigns across our inventory to achieve their specific objectives further increasing ROI. ", "At the heart of this growth and engagement daily active users and revenue is the creativity of our community which is one of the things that makes Snapchat so unique. Each one of our daily active users creates over 20 snaps per day on average to express themselves and communicate with their friends. The best part of working with Snap is leveraging the creativity of our communities to build new products like maps, search and memories where we empower Snapchaters to do more with what they create. ", "We found that the best way to grow our business is to build products that inspire our community to create snap like lenses and creative tools and provide new outlets like Custom Stories and Maps, so that our community can share their creations with their friends. When we're able to do both of these things well, we create a virtuous cycle where our community both creates and use more snaps. ", "This quarter, we continued to invest in empowering creativity with new lenses and creative tools. Today, we\u2019re focused primarily on front facing camera effects that augment selfies but this quarter we announced a product designed specifically for the outward facing camera on smartphones, we call this product World Lenses, and we worked hard to build the underlying technology to recognize the world and render interactive objects and experiences on top of it. Its early days but we have had so much fun watching our community interact with World Lenses. ", "Our dancing hot dog is most likely the world's first augmented reality super star, viewed over 1.5 billion times in snaps created by our community. We released several new creative tools this quarter for our community to express themselves and have fun. People can now create custom stickers, use the magic eraser to remove an object, add a playful backdrop or alter the background color of their snaps. Creative tools are particularly important on our platform because we want to empower people to express themselves and communicate visually instead of simply taking a photograph. ", "We have found that when we offer more creative tools, our community creates more snaps. With so many snaps created every day on our service, we want to make sure that our community has many different ways to share their snaps both directly with friends and more broadly with the public. We watched stories in 2013 and have constantly iterated on the product as engagement has grown over the years. ", "We created a new type of story this quarter, Custom Stories. Custom Stories are perfect for occasions like parties, vacations and wedding or really any other time you want to collaborate on a story with a specific group of friends or around a specific location. We've had so much fun watching stories created by our friends with their own special events. ", "This quarter saw more story snap views than ever before both in aggregate and per user, not only with regards to user generated content but also premium content provided by our partners. There are more people watching more publisher stories than ever before with publisher story views increasing 30% quarter-over-quarter. ", "We continue to evolve our celebrated stories format to serve the demand for different types of mobile content experiences. One example of this evolution is the growing popularity of shows on Snapchat. We are working with a number of partners that are embracing this mobile story selling format doubling the number of new shows premiering on our service this quarter and compared to Q1. The engagement around shows is particularly exciting.", "For example, Phone Swap, a new show created through our joint venture with Vertical Networks often sees over 10 million viewers for a single episode putting it on par with some of the most popular shows on television. The success of shows is already extending beyond our service. Phone Swap is getting picked up for television and the Voice on Snapchat was nominated for an Emmy Award. We can't wait to see how shows continue evolve. ", "This quarter we also launched Snap Map, a whole new way to see the world. Snap Map is a traditional map designed to get you where you are going it\u2019s a new site of map for figuring out where you want to go. Since the launch of Snap Map content submitted to our story has increased 30% demonstrating that providing new ways to distribution snaps further incentivizes our community to create more snaps and contribute their point of view.", "Memories is another great example of how we have been able to methodically expand upon a snap creation and consumption experience in Snapchat. Historically Snapchat was always known at least in part to the assembling [ph] nature of the content on our service. Recently however we have been pleased with the growth of our Memories product they allows our community to save their creations and share them at a later date. Now over 250 million snaps are saved to Memories every day creating a great foundation for products that make it easy to reminisce. It's always fun to look back on some of our favorite snaps and we believe that Memories will become an even more important part of the Snapchat experience in the future. ", "We've seen great traction with many of our new products. From lenses and creative tools and inspire snap creation to search maps and memories that provide new ways to view snaps. Although many of these products are in their infancy, we should be able to improve them quickly as our community adopts them and let us know how we can better serve their needs. We love that our community continues to experiment with and embrace new products and we are excited that these new behaviors are driving more engagement on Snapchat. ", "We continue to make progress on Android performance this quarter and we've been able to address most of the low hanging fruit that we believe has impacted the customer experience. The remaining performance improvements will come from larger structural changes to our service that will take some time. This quarter we focused on building systems and processes to ensure that we can maintain quality and performance over the long-term. We've defined key customer facing metrics that we believe directly impact use and engagement and we are working hard to improve them and at a minimum reach parity with our iOS application. ", "We are still on the early stages of making these improvements and I would estimate that we won't begin to see the meaningful results of these efforts until the second quarter of next year. This is an unfortunate side effective of the past pace of innovation that prioritizes product execution over the architectural integrity of our software. We've made some great additions to our team this quarter who can help us move as quickly as possible to improve the quality and performance of our service and we are looking forward to making more progress. We're committed to delivering a fantastic Android experience to our community.", "As a final note, given the amount of speculation around the lack of exploration I feel it is important to note that Bobby and I will not sell any of shares this year. The company will withhold the shares needed to satisfy our few tax of holding obligations. We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap. ", "Thanks again for joining us today. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We made great progress this quarter on the monetization side. Advertising revenue increased 146% year-over-year and 25% quarter-over-quarter. Our community grew to an average of 173 million daily active users. This growth was primarily driven by users in the U.S. and Canada with over 40% of our net ads in Q2 coming from these countries.", "Today we have over 69 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada which are two of the most monetizable markets in the world. Together these two countries represent half of all global mobile advertising spent, our traction in core markets like the U.S. and Canada puts us in a great position as we would scale our monetization by allowing our advertisers to leverage our platforms to reach. ", "For example, an advertiser wanting to reach 13 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. would access our publicly available ad manager tool and reach 75% of the total U.S. population in that age group over the course of a multi week campaign. As Evan mentioned we're seeing incredible engagement from our community, which is very exciting for our advertising business. ", "For example, story snap views are higher than they had ever been before. This is important because it generates more inventory and we know advertisers have demand for competing formats like our full screen video Snap ads. An average daily active user that plays with Lenses spends over three minutes doing so daily creating a unique opportunity for advertisers to get lots of engagement with a sponsor lens. This strong growth and engagement trends from our community will allow us to keep scaling our advertising business in the future.", "We remain focused on three key areas that I outlined last quarter. First, enhancing our ad offerings for both brands and direct response advertisers. Second, developing efficient tools for our advertisers. And third, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ", "First, enhancing our ad offerings; building ad products that solve a variety of advertisers' business objective is a key priority for us. Over 75% of the top 100 adage leading national advertisers spent on our platform last quarter. And what's more important our existing customers are spending more money with us. In fact, revenue from advertisers on a parent level that spent with us in the first half of 2016 grew 142% year-over-year during the first half of 2017.", "Despite significant investment growth by our existing partners we still have a lot more room to grow. The recent launch of our self-service platform will help us not only tap in to additional spend from our existing advertiser base but also on board long tail and mid tail advertisers. We expect this combination of increasing spend by existing advertisers and increasing our advertiser count will help us drive solid revenue growth in the future. ", "This quarter we also expanded our global capabilities with our ads now available in 10 additional countries including Hong Kong, India and Israel. With this expansion, our advertisers can reach users in 39 different countries. ", "I would like to share an example of how we have worked with one partner, Time Warner, to become a larger part of their strategy. Time Warner was an early adopter of our platform who went from experimenting on our platform to scaling that investment across all of our products and offerings. ", "On the advertising side, we've worked with their movie studio Warner Brothers on 48 movie releases since 2015. Most recently we've partnered with them on the release of Wonder Woman. We helped them reach Snapchatters in 26 countries globally. They used a multi-product approach to drive great results including Geofilters, Lenses and the Snap Ad web view Attachments with a custom-built game. On average Snapchatters spend nearly one-minute engaging with this ad. Overall, the campaign was highly effective with more than half of Snapchatters exposed to both the Snap Ads and lenses, said they were likely to see the film in theaters. ", "On the content side, two of Time Warner's companies, CNN and Bleacher Report were among our first publishers when we launched Discover in January of 2015. We worked closely with them to create engaging and effective content for our community. Both brands have seen great success to-date. On Snapchat alone, CNN and Bleacher Report have global monthly audiences of over 12 million and 16 million respectively. ", "It's also important that we offer ad formats to help solve direct response objectives. I want to talk about the progress we've made here which we are very pleased with. Here're two examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments, our direct response product continues to perform well. ", "First, The Economist used our Snap Ads with Attachments product to launch their first UK campaign in June. The campaign was a huge success. The average cost per lead on Snapchat was \u00a310.28 compared to \u00a362 on display and six time more efficient cost per lead than their other marketing channels. ", "Second, Active and audience fitness apps, also used our Snap Ads with Attachments product to drive both installed and high-quality users. With this campaign, we are able to deliver users at a 30% lower cost per install than their other channels. But Active wasn't just looking for the lowest price, they were also looking for strong engagement, that's why we are thrilled that the users they acquired were highly engaged with Active audio workout programs. ", "Another area we continue to invest in is to allow advertisers to reach exactly the audience they want to reach. For example, a simple [ph] looking to advertise to both parents and young adults can leverage several of our targeting capabilities to ensure they reach the most relevant audience. They can use a combination of our native targeting capabilities called Snap Lifestyle category to reach family travelers, as well as our third-party data to reach family vacationers. This allows them to reach more than 8 million Snapchatters in the U.S. They can also narrow in on married moms over the age of 35 who control household budgets, and audience segments that we call money minders and reach over 4 million Snapchatters with real buying power. We're very excited that we can offer lower prices combined with high engagement, a winning combination that continues to drive our advertising business. ", "The second area that we remain focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers; in order to scale our advertising business, we need to make it easy for any and all advertisers to buy on our platform. 60% of Snap Ads impressions are now being delivered programmatically, more than doubled from last quarter. Because we're still in early stages of monetization we're focused on onboarding as many advertisers as possible. Advertisers can bid for desired business objectives like apps installs or video views and our platform will optimize that delivery in real time. Increasing automation on our apps platform is driving better ROI for our advertisers. In fact, for our app install advertisers, the average cost per app install has decreased 80% since the launch of our auction. Over time though, we expect the auction dynamic and increased demand to drive up pricing levels. Our focus in coming months will be making it even easier for advertisers to find exactly what they are looking for on our self-service platform. ", "And finally, the third area of focus is further proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Over 90% of retail transactions still happen in physical stores. Advertisers are very egger to measure the effectiveness of their digital spending in the real world. That\u2019s why in June we announced the acquisition of location based analytics and ad measurement company called Placed. With Placed we will be able to measure activities such as store visits and offline purchases that prove digital ads are driving real value for advertisers. Placed is one of many measurement partners that we work with including Nelson, Oracle Data Cloud, Newster, [indiscernible] Moat and several others. We're committed to working with the best third-party measurement companies to provide transparency to our advertisers. ", "Our investments in creating an offline sales measurement ecosystem are paying off. I would like to share measurement results from three different industry categories that show our advertising is driving profit for our customers. ", "First, in the retail apparel category Snapchat drove a ROAS or return on app spend that was 2.7 times the average ROAS across all online and offline media spend for best category as measured by Newster market share. ", "Second, in the movie theatrical release category, Snapchat drove a ROAS that was 5.1 times the average ROAS for all media spend as measured by Newster market share.", "And third, Snapchat drove an average ROAS of $3.53 at gross 16 consumer packaged goods campaign. This outperformed the average ROAS of $2.58 for mobile advertising campaigns for Q4 of 2016 as measured by Nielsen Catalina Solutions. ", "We\u2019re very pleased with what we've accomplished in the first half of the year, looking ahead we're going to stay focused on scaling our adverting business and investing in the right areas to succeed in the long-term. ", "Thank you everyone for the time and now I will hand it over to Drew. ", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results featured growing revenues and expanding gross margins with continued investments in people and acquisitions. ", "In the quarter, we made strong progress against our three financial goals which are designed to pave our path to profitable growth and prioritize strategic investments along the way. As a quick reminder, we\u2019re focused on executing these financial strategies. ", "First, driving both revenue and ARPU growth while expanding gross margins; second, moderating capital intensity to ensure strong EBITDA to free cash flow conversion and third, investing in front house resources and M&A to build rapid scale in innovation and monetization. ", "Let me build on incremental revenues and growing gross margins. In the quarter, revenues grew 153% year-over-year to $181.7 million and grew 21% sequentially. Looking regionally, revenues in North America were $147.6 million up 126% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Revenue outside North America showed nice progress. Total international revenues were $34.1 million or 19% of sales up from 9% a year ago and 14% sequentially. ", "Looking across the product line revenue from both Creative Tools and Snap Ads increased year-over-year and sequentially. In the quarter revenue increases were driven by substantial gains in ad impressions partially offset by lower Snap Ad pricing. Impression gains were higher for both Creative Tools and Snap Ads. As Imran noted more than half of Snap Ads were served by auction more than double from last quarter. The mixed shift fueled solid growth in Snap Ad impressions but this mix shift also resulted in lower Snap Ad blended pricing as we moved from selling reserved inventory at set prices to selling unreserved inventory at auction rates. ", "Our goal overtime would be to try Snap Ad pricing higher through strong auction participation and improved targeting. Across the company Snap sold revenue was a $164.8 million, partner sold revenue was $11.5 million and other revenues were $5.4 million substantially all of which was driven by spectacles. ", "Average revenue per user or ARPU was a $1.05 in the second quarter up from $0.50 a year ago and up from $0.90 in Q1. North America remains a leading indicator for the potential of the business and North American ARPU was a $1.97 up 85% versus last year and up 9% sequentially.", "Consistent with our first strategy, gross margins grew nicely in the second quarter. Please note that when I discuss expense figures and gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Gross margins grew to 19% in Q2 up 5,100 basis points from the year ago and 1,400 basis points sequentially. Gross margins benefitted from three key drivers. First, strong profit flow through from incremental ad dollars; second, stable hosting cost per user and third, cost leverage on revenue share expenses. ", "In the quarter user engagement, time spend, snaps created and other metrics grew nicely. But our engineering saving initiatives nearly offset all of those cost increases. Sequentially user hosting cost rose only slightly from $0.60 per user in Q1 to $0.61 in Q2. ", "Additionally, revenue share expenses fell sequentially from 16% of sales to 13% of sales due to the expanded monetization of products without revenue shares such as My Story. Overall the scale potential of our financial model is starting to take shape. Measuring year-over-year we've seen over 50% flow through in our incremental sales to gross margin dollars. But sequentially we saw an 83% flow through in the quarter at a $32.0 million increase in sales drove $26.7 million in incremental gross profit dollars. ", "We made strong progress against our second financial strategy which is to moderate the capital intensity of our business. Our primary lever remains our cloud hosting strategy where we rely on partner expertise, their scale and capital to serve our customers. ", "We continue to see both competitive cost to serve at $0.61 in the second quarter and a competitive advantage on our capital spending. Capital expenses in the quarter were modest and consistent at $19.4 million primarily driven by facility expansion to support our growing organization. For the last 12 months, our CapEx was $75 million which is less than $0.50 per current user, well below what other company spend. ", "We made good progress on our third financial strategy which is to make investments in the front of house resources in M&A to rapidly scale innovation and monetization. In the quarter headcount grew from 2,360 to approximately 2,600 including acquisitions. 90% of the new hires were in engineering and sales similar to Q1.", "Overall, operating expenses increased 17% sequentially to $228.7 million due to higher personnel cost. Annualized cost per employee were pretty consistent but up slightly versus prior periods at $351,000 per employee. We made additional investments in M&A which the company will do selectively. ", "During the quarter, we spent slightly more than $200 million in cash with some other performance considerations. In it remarks Imran spoke to the strategic benefits of our recent acquisitions have placed. Please note the company was acquired in July so we reflect that acquisition in our Q3 financials.", "Overall, net loss was $443.1 million for the quarter which included expected stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $242.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $194.0 million compared to a loss of $188.2 million in Q1 and a loss of $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. ", "We remain in a strong cash position, cash and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter was $2.8 billion. As of June 30, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1.181 billion and 1.446 billion on a fully diluted basis. ", "Recently with the expiration of the lockup, RSUs [ph] were settled for employees between March 2, 2017 and July 29, 2017. As a result, we withheld from employees approximately 7.8 million shares or around 105 million based on the July 28, 2017 closing price. The tax payments were funded from cash on hand. The shares are no longer considered outstanding for accounting purposes. As future employee shares vest, we will periodically evaluate this net settled share strategy. ", "As we move forward we wanted to share some thoughts on the balance of 2017. With respect to the seasonal trajectory of the advertising revenue in the prior year, our Q3 2016 results benefited from demand related to the summer Olympics and elections. Normalizing for those increases our revenue grew $39 million from Q2 2016 to Q3 2016.", "For hosting expenses, we experienced a substantial increase in time spent in Q2 coinciding with the Maps product launch. Increased time is a strategic benefit for our business, but we pay more for additional usage. Late in Q2 hosting cost per user increased around 10% or so versus the Q2 run rate. ", "Finally, our Q2 hiring pace was slow in the recent quarters, in the short term we plan to apply a similar approach in pace as we focus organic hiring from early on engineering in sales, but keep in mind hiring can be lumpy from quarter-over-quarter. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to the current pace. ", "With that I would now like to turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I can, one on Ad product and one on engagement, first on Ad product, wondering what you're seeing from the ramp in API buying the roll out of self service and just better measurement and targeting. Are you seeing a real tangible response from these tools such that you think you can kind of scale meaningfully in the second half from your largest advertisers? ", "And then second one maybe for Evan, with the new product rolling out across search and maps, wondering if you can elaborate on what kind of uptake you're seeing here whether this is driving really more engagement or DAU growth, you just indicated engagement really picked up recently, maybe you can elaborate on that? Thanks.", "Drew Vollero", "I'll take the first question and Evan will take the second, so we're very excited about the traction we saw from our self-service and API, just to remind everyone that we launched our API in October and self-service was launched in Q2 and we've already seen in Q2 60% of all Snap Ad buying -- Snap Ad impressions were delivered to our self-service and API platform, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment for such a really since such a short period of time. ", "And we're also seeing that our direct response advertisers are seeing good traction, so are all brand advertisers. In my prepared remarks, I talked about how cost per install have decreased 80% since the launch of our app install business; so, we're very-very excited and we think there's a great opportunity to scale the business as we brought in more-and-more advertisers on the platform.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, to your product question, we're obviously super excited about maps, it's early days. I don't have any additional metrics to share beyond what I mentioned earlier, but I think the most important thing for us as it pertains to maps, is introducing the concept that maps can be used for discovery and not just for directions and so really excited that people are using our map to learn about the world. ", "I think the other thing that\u2019s important to note is that maps is a great example of how we can use all the different unique pieces of Snapchat to make a totally new product. So, for example, maps combines our intimate front graph, emojis and also our story, as all the story submissions from all over the world to create a product that's obviously very complex, but yet really simple to use. So, I think maps is a great example of the innovation that really leverages the product foundation we've built over the years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Andrew [indiscernible] on for Ron. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you guys help us understand engagement with Search on Snapchat, now that we're six months into the product? ", "And then with the Snap certified partners program that you guys announced in June, how are you guys balancing that with the sales force, can you just help us understand the [indiscernible] how you're dealing with that? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, so again I think early days on search as people are learning that they can search for stories and not just their friends, the pre-type experience that we've when you tap into search is a really important part of that learning process and I think we're getting better at showing really interesting content depending on who you are, so for instance baseball -- you see a bunch of baseball stories and also teaches, concepts that there's a story for everything, so, early days there but I think it's a great opportunity.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to the channel conflict we view our sales force as a consultant for our partners, so their job is to educate the market, how to buy ad and how to leverage our platform to deliver the ROI for them, and we want to make it incredibly easier for them to buy ad on our platform however they want to, so they can buy directly through insertion order or they can use our certified partners or they can come to our self-service platform and buy through that. So, I think our self-service gets credit regardless how the client buys on our platform but their job is to educate the market and solving the clients' business problem and which they are doing a great job. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Brian Nowak ", "The first one on the ad monetization, I know it's very early in the monetization but can you just talk about some of the main points of friction, you still you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars on the platform and specifically around the API and the self-service, just talk to what you have to change to really drive faster growth there. ", "And then the second one, could you talk about some of the structural change that you had to make to improve the Android product over the next year? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "I think first of all I think it's important to recognize that we launched the self-service in Q2 and so I think we're still early days, but I think few things we have to work on, number one, onboard more advertisers, make it even easier for people to buy on our platform, now people can buy static image ad on our platform and other kind of things, the third thing is we need to train people how to leverage our platform, every platform is different and what works in one platform, not necessarily work in other platform, so working on the education process. So those are the few things that we're working through it. As you saw we've onboarded quite a significant amount of static ad partners on our platform and we continue to do so. But we\u2019re pretty happy with what we\u2019ve seen so far on our self-service platform. ", "Drew Vollero", "I'm hesitant to get for a deepened with the technical stuff but I can give sort of simple example, we started testing its migration last week, migrating our Android application from a text view to a surface view, [indiscernible] so make a huge difference in performance, swiping, camera start, the frame rate of the camera and that\u2019s an example of just a larger structural change. There are a number of changes we're making around threading [ph] any application, it should make a difference but [indiscernible] across the entire platform and so it will necessarily take longer. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Devitt with Stifel. ", "Scott Devitt ", "Imran one for you and Evan one for you, first one as the ad platform continues to be build out, it does seem like the business potentially reaches these points where it can have monetization and selection and ARPU expands very quickly in a short period of time. So, I was wondering Imran if you can explain whether there is any validity that assertion on my behalf and if so, what are the sign post we should be watching for in terms of products that you discussed on the call or otherwise in the ad business to look forward in seeing that over the next six to 12 months. ", "And then secondly for Evan, would just be interested in how content density of location based pictures or the Discovery feature ramping in maps, how that is changing the way that users are posting content to make content more publicly available into Discovery features like that. ", "And then finally without giving away specifics, Evan how do you feel about the product pipeline for the rest of the year? Thank you. ", "Imran Khan", "So, Scott on your first question you're absolutely right and we feel the same way. I think if you look at our business there are multiple drivers, we started our business focusing on large advertisers and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we are seeing. I've talked about how on parent levels things are advertisers are spending on our platform grew 142% year-over-year during the first half of 2017 compared to first half of 2016. ", "One of the big friction point for many advertisers to buy ad on our platform was they wanted a self-service platform access and we launched the self-service platform and we are transitioning our Snap ad buying to our self-service platform and we talked about how 60% of all Snapchat impression buying happened through self-service and API. But as we're bringing more and more advertisers on our auction platform that would be a significant driver for our growth on our platform. So, there is a lot of small business and medium sized business that we need to onboard and that will drive the significant growth for that. So, I think what I'm really-really excited about, what you should think about that continued progress in the self-service and our progress on bringing these S&P businesses on our platform. ", "Evan Spiegel", "As it pertains to maps, obviously I mentioned the increase in submissions to our story which is the publicly available content following the release of maps and I think that's just an example of this virtuous cycle where people when they submit their snaps and they see that\u2019s being viewed by folks all over the world and then they see that you can't grow up in our release products like maps, I think it's sort of self-fulfilling. So very excited about that and sort of excited to continue to expand on these different outlets for creativity for folks on our service. You mentioned sort of the broader product pipeline, very excited about that and this is what we will love to do over here, so we're having a great having time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler ", "I had two questions on ad seasonality and on Discover. Drew, just to follow up you said that last year in 3Q we had the Olympics and the election, currently the street expects about 50% quarter-on-quarter growth in the third quarter and you just did 21% in the second quarter, so given that we won't have seasonality or we won't have the Olympics and election, can you speak to that 50% how comfortably you feel about that.", "And then based on our math, Discover revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter at around $60 million, so just talk about where the ad load is in Discover and if that map is correct, where the acceleration is happening between stories and then the lenses left inside of the app? Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Look at couple of levels here, we don\u2019t get into the sales forecasting business so what we try to do is give you visibility to the comp from last year. Equal [ph] last year revenues from 71 million in second quarter last year to 128 million in the third quarter of last year. We did have a nice benefit from the two things that I called out with the summer Olympics and then also we had a little bit of an election bump as well. If you normalize to that, that gain was more like $39 million gains so you can get a sense on sort of the size of that bump in the quarter so we thought that would help provide some perspective as you think about sales in the back half of the year. ", "As it relates to where the advertising is being placed it's hard for me to comment on a particular product line. I will say though that we certainly had a lot of success with Snap-ads broadening them across the platform, you can see that in our revenue share expenses, our revenue share expenses fell 300 basis points and that really was just advertisements being placed more on places where we don\u2019t have revenue share agreements like custom stories. So anyway, that was really the way you can put those pieces together but overall, we saw a good breath of Snap ads across both the Discover platform and the My Story platforms.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thank I'm following up just it's interesting, following up Ross' questions. What for Imran seasonality on Drew on the same question of revenue share expense. So, Imran you said in May [indiscernible] conference had which you considered the company more likely look at an agency or salvation company and seasonality your 3Q, 2Q, 1Q, given your mix is changing in 2Q does is comment still valid or do you think that we're going to see seasonality, it looks more akin to some of your digital peers.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're still early. I think if you look at our big brand business is 2-years-old and our self-service business it was just launched in Q2 and while we are very excited about the traction we're seeing and the growth we're seeing but it will take some time to get the equilibrium. And so, it will take some time, so over the years yes seasonality will be more and more muted in the business but it will take some time.", "Michael Nathanson", "And then for Drew, on Ross' last question, what was the last 3 quarters on page 6 on the revenue share cost, its been flat so I know you've done a good job of finding other places to monetize but what can we learn more broadly about the flatness there, what's going on in underline may be usage trends or just selling against whatever there is Discovery I guess past three quarters.", "Drew Vollero", "The big thing to remember about Discover at a high level is it\u2019s a good partnership between the company and the publishers, that business works because both sides of the equation make money. I think we continue to slide an awful lot of ads within the Discover platform. I think the difference over time has really been broadening other avenues for distribution outside of the Discover platform. And so really what you\u2019re seeing is that the revenue gains are being flat at some times on different platforms. ", "There is a little bit that I talked about in the first quarter call as well where we restructured a couple of agreements to these sort of more fixed key arrangements so there is a little bit of something in that well but for the most part really the ability to leverage that expense has being our ability to put advertisements outside of the Discover partnerships as we grow, but first and foremost Discover partnerships we believe our long term partnership and it's important that both sides, both the publishers and the company make money doing that and that\u2019s really what we're focused on first and foremost.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "First, you talked about more than 50% of the impression has been coming from the auction and just that it seems lower price Snap ads or is auction is dragging the account. So now that you have more market based price discoveries, is there further risk just Snap ads pricing in the near term and how does that change or alter your direct sales efforts if it does. ", "And then secondly Drew, is there anything that you can talk about just on 4Q, certainly seems like the NFL and holiday should return so I don't think there is anything that normal there but anything to call out as we look deeper into the year. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, Imran mentioned over 60% of Snap ads were purchased through our auction, which is more than double last quarter and we believe overall that the transition to a bided auction is the best way to grow our business over the long term but you're right, even though pricing is lower in the short term as we're on board more advertisers. I think lower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage, especially in the short term because it provides an incentive for advertisers to get over the hurdle of having to learn how to use Snap, and given the dynamics that we're seeing in the industry in the marketplace, where mobile ad pricing seems to be increasing pretty quickly due to limited impressions, we think that this offering of lower prices and high engagement is really attractive to advertisers and hopefully as we're seeing we'll incentivize them onboard quickly and take advantage of this.", "Drew Vollero", "As it relates to your second question I think you're thinking about the right key drivers seasonally in the fourth quarter of 2016, revenues went from a 128 million to 166 million, our drivers really were at that point that holiday bump that you get. We do have a as you mentioned strong partnerships both the NFL and college football, those really -- their strongest parts are really in that fall season as well, so those are really the two big drivers. We did have a little bump from an election standpoint but not enough to call out, but those are really the two key drivers, we do think there'll be a Christmas in our deals with both the NFL and college football are even deeper partnerships this year. So, I think we should -- I think we'll look forward to the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Another one along the lines of the auction dynamics and how it impacts pricing, just given how quickly the self-service platform has ramped, would you say that the bulk of the pricing pressure that you'll see on the overall business will be largely behind us by the end of the year or is this something that will likely continue to be a headwind for bit longer than that? ", "And then another question, your monetization relative to your public peers is significantly lower, one of the questions that we get is out of the significant daily usage that you have on the platform how much of that is spent doing things that might be more difficult to directly monetize versus activities where you have a real opportunity to monetize?", "Imran Khan", "I think on your second question I think if you go to our self-service platform you can see that a significant portion of our DAU is actually you can reach them through our self-service platform, so these are fairly monetizable audience base. And one of the fact that we don't do growth hacking like notification and things like that, our users actually come to our platform on their own, and they spend a lot of time on it, and that makes a great opportunity to monetize them. ", "And with regards to pricing, look we don't want to get into the guidance but one of the thing is that we are super excited, the kind of ROI that some of our advertisers are seeing on our platform. We're only two years into monetization and we want to onboard as many advertisers as possible on our platform and deliver incredible ROI for them, primarily in an environment when there's not enough mobile video inventory on the marketplace; so we're [indiscernible] with it, where we are with that. Drew, I don't know if you have anything to add. ", "Mark May", "Imran, just to clarify your first answer I wasn't talking about the total users that can be monetized, I was talking about the time that they spend of that 30 minutes plus, how much of that time is spent in activities where you can naturally monetize that activity -- their time...", "Evan Spiegel", "I think yes, this is an important thing to understand about our business obviously we monetize creation with our creation tools, and then that fans out into communication and into our stories products and so in that sense the communication products and the stories product create the audience for their creative tools and obviously we monetize stories with Snap Ads. So, I think you\u2019re seeing the behavior across the platform being monetized, again as Imran's mentioned very early stages. But we're monetizing engagement across the service. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Eric Sheridan ", "May be two, one going back to the auction dynamics, is there any sense you can give us about the pace of growth of breadth in the advertiser base over the last 12 months and how you see that trending over the next 12 months so we can get a bit sense of some of the tail winds around the base of advertisers that are coming into the platform.", "And second, one of the big areas of hiring in the ad sales force, Imran wanted to know if you can give us an update on efficiency in the ad sales team, how that ramps and what that might mean for tailwinds in the business over the next six to 18 months as people get up to productivity. Thanks. ", "Imran Khan", "On your first question, I think we're seeing more and more direct response advertisers are coming to our platform and now that we have self-service, that was one of that biggest ask when you talk to them what they wanted to see from us. And they are coming to our platform and they are seeing great results and we\u2019re pretty pleased with it and we continue to optimize it.", "And I think we launched self-service again in Q2 and we're seeing good start and I think and I'm very excited what possible in terms of number of advertisers on board on our platform. ", "With regards to self-efficiencies, I think as Drew pointed out that in Q2 our head count growth rate moderated significantly, a big reason is moderation in sales and marketing organization and I think what you will see that we expect continue to see improved productivity out of our sales organization as we rolled out all of this efficient buying tools for our advertisers, so I think that should will be a going trend going forward. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ", "Jason Helfstein ", "I just want to dig into scale versus measurement. How much of the friction on the advertiser side is because advertisers want to run more of a display ads that they are running in other platforms as opposed to more engaging video ads that you guys tend to prefer. And then what are those video ads that need to be custom created as opposed to the advertisers are just looking for more and different measurement that you don\u2019t offer. Thanks. ", "Imran Khan", "On the measurement side, I think we made quite a bit of progress. I think vast majority of advertising -- significant portion of advertising that happens on a platform and the big dollar that people spend, there is a measurement attached to it. So, I think advertisers are seeing good ROI from that. I gave quite a few examples that Nelson Catalina or [Newster], the kind of ROI that advertisers are seeing from our platform. ", "We now have more than 15 different third-party partners that we\u2019re partnering with on our platform to providing transparency to our advertisers, we're incredibly committed to provide transparency and I think the kind of results that advertisers seeing on our platform, we want to celebrate them and we want to share that with other advertisers. Can you repeat your first question please?", "Evan Spiegel", "I can take that as it pertains to the creative, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a barrier at all for big brands, I think people are seeing the value of full screen vertical video, it's pretty obvious across the industry. I think the barrier is definitely more of an issue for small businesses and direct response which is why we created the Snap publisher tool that we just released. It's pretty fun to play with, if you want to check it out but you can see how easy it is to create vertical video from all of your existing assets. So, I think that will be really important part of on-boarding more advertisers. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield ", "I've got two questions for Evan. Evan on your first investor call and actually Imran have just mentioned it earlier as well. You have both spoken about how others use growth hacking to inflate DAUs and how it really hurts the platform's relationship with users yet we definitely over the past quarter began to see push notifications from Snapchat essentially alerting us to one of our friends or one of our connections has published a story would you like to go and see it. Wondering despite Imran\u2019s comments earlier, has your philosophy on growth hacking begun to change? ", "And then two, time spent on Snapchat and Instagram based on the recent comments from Instagram it seems like it's fairly similar, but there is a very -- and my sense is there is very little direct messaging that happens on Instagram implying that most of their time spent is actually content consumption. When you think about Snapchat's 30 minutes of usage per day how much of that is actually stories including Discover versus basically communications? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, on the first question we've been sending notification like that for stories for friends since 2014 so I'm not sure why you are just seeing that now. ", "On the time spent I think time spent is definitely an interesting metric because unlike daily active time spent is zero sum. So for us in Q2 we saw over 40 minutes spent per day for users under 25 and over 20 minutes per day per user over 25 so I think that\u2019s some strong growth for us on the time spent side. ", "We don\u2019t breakout stories versus communications but I think the important thing is we've done a very good job innovating around monetizing communication I think historically that's been challenging for folks so we're really excited about the way we've monetized communication with our creative tools.", "Richard Greenfield", "So maybe just to be clear what exactly is the growth hacking that others do? If you send me push notifications, it's not growth hacking. What are others doing that you consider to be growth hacking and not real DAU growth?", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, I think there are plenty of examples online if you want to go for a Google, but I think the most important thing for us is that when we are telling you about content on a service that is really highly relevant to you and from your very close friends and I think if people as they become more reliant on push notifications to sort of relax the standards there and I think it's important for our business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. ", "Mark Mahaney ", "I\u2019ll still limit myself to one question. Evan you talked about probably not seeing a meaningful impact from these Android innovations changes until the second quarter of next year.", "What is the meaningful impact mean. I think for investors they love to see some sort of inflection up in the rest of world DAUs and maybe that was handicapped by the Android problems over the last year. So is that what we should see? Was that what you meant by a meaningful impact or just describe what you meant? Thanks a lot. ", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, so I think for us meaningful impact -- we definitely look at engagement, we would really like Android users more engage. I think a lot of that is focused on the camera functionality, it's really tough across all the different camera hardware and all these different phones and the different camera APIs, so we really like to see that improve and that's takes a lot of work, obviously because our service is still focused on creation that's something that's really important.", "And I think just because you mentioned the rest of the world DAU I want to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about that because I do think that the market continues to focus on daily active users as a proxy metric for revenue opportunity which is why we always encourage folks to look at the ARPU numbers in our industry across different geos. ", "So just for some examples, looking at other folks in the industry mobile and advertising business as a comp. We have to add more than 10 million daily active users in the rest of world for everyone 1 million daily active users in U.S. and Canada in order to make the same amount of money. So obviously with 10 times of number of users we also incur 10 times the cost, the hosting cost to make the same amount of money. So that would impact the cash flow profile of our business. ", "I think in a way that\u2019s just not a feeling this stage of our business, so I think we look down the road a little bit over the next five to 10 years many of the market but today with those challenges the structure of our business will become more appealing as the more wide markets develop, mobile devices improve and reach parity and faster connectivity becomes cheap and hopefully ubiquitous. So, at that point we'll necessarily focus our growth efforts outside of the core market. ", "I believe that Snapchat is one of our six platforms with over 150 million daily actives outside of China and the other five or so platforms grown by two companies with an aggregate market cap in excess of $1 trillion. So, the reason I say this is to illustrate that we've always been last to market competing against giant companies and we've historically been able to grow our business in markets that are highly competitive and saturated by our competitors because we're so focused on innovation. ", "And so, I think that explains why we are willing take this wait and see approach in markets like the rest of the world that don\u2019t make financial sense for our business at this point, but may make sense in the future. And so, we will continue to reevaluate our opportunities there and keep you posted. ", "Operator", "This concludes our question and answer session as well as today's conference. We thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect. "]}

Thank you very much.", "Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and we make no obligation to update our disclosures.", "For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks described in our prospectus dated March 1, 2017, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. This information can also be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for Investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends.", "These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com. At times in our prepared comments, or in response to questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly and annual results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hello everyone and welcome to the call. Our business really came together towards the end of last year and I am very proud of our team for working hard to deliver these results. We executed well on our 2017 plan to improve quality, performance, and automation, which removed friction from our advertising business and improved our application for the Snapchat community. This translated into annual revenues that grew 104% from the prior year, and 8.9 million Daily Active Users added in the fourth quarter, the highest number of quarterly net adds since the third quarter of 2016.", "All this growth came at a lower cost than the previous quarter. Cash burn decreased 49% from the prior quarter, and gross margin increased 1,400 points sequentially to 36%. These are big improvements that show how quickly Snap can scale when our products and our ad business are working well together. In 2017, we focused on removing friction from our products, our advertising business, and our team. Last year, we talked a lot about our investments in Android and the importance of improving our Android application. Our community has benefited significantly from the changes we have made throughout 2017, and we\u2019re excited to see the impact of this hard work reflected in our Daily Active User growth.", "The retention rate of new Android users increased by nearly 20% when compared to last year, meaning that the people who try Snapchat on Android are much more likely to stick around and become Daily Active Users. Additionally, the fourth quarter saw significantly more new Android users as a percentage of net additional users than any other quarter in our history. It wasn\u2019t just Android that grew because of our efforts. Our growth on iOS continues, and we were honored and excited to end the year with Bitmoji and Snapchat as the number one and number two most popular apps of 2017 in the Apple App Store. Our advertising business changed profoundly over the past year as we migrated the sale of our Snap Ads to an automated auction. Over 90% of Snap Ads were bought programmatically during Q4, which means that the auction transition for Snap Ads is largely behind us. We are learning a lot while operating our automated advertising platform and we are constantly improving the way we sell and serve advertising.", "In Q4, our effective price per impression decreased by 25% while our total advertising revenue grew 38% sequentially. More importantly, we increased advertising impressions by over four times year-over-year while continuing to grow per-user engagement. This demonstrates that our platform can deliver value and efficiency at scale for our advertisers. Over the past two years, we hired over 2,400 people, roughly 100 new team members every month. While it was critical to build our team to keep pace with the growth of our business, it has become clear that we can now unlock substantially more productivity simply by changing the way that we work and by continuing to build an inclusive and creative culture.", "As such, we plan to moderate the growth of our team over the next year and focus on making sure that we have the right team, leadership, and organizational practices in place to support our culture and our mission. We are determined to have a close-knit, hardworking team that is brimming with positive energy and we will continue to make the necessary changes to ensure that everyone at our company is aligned with our values. We ended 2017 confident that we can grow our Snapchat community and monetize our products more efficiently than ever before. With our plans for user growth, augmented reality, and content in 2018, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. We\u2019re going to keep up the hard work and stay focused on the big opportunities ahead.", "Improving application performance is just the beginning when it comes to removing friction so that our community can grow and enjoy Snapchat. We have recently launched partnerships with wireless carriers in over a dozen markets to begin reducing cellular bandwidth costs for Snapchatters around the world. We have seen that when data is less expensive, more people are willing to use our data-intensive products. This is important because Snapchat can be more fun to use out in the world rather than at home on WiFi. We feel strongly that Snapchat should not be confined to our mobile application, the amazing Snaps created by our community deserve wider distribution so they can be enjoyed by everyone.", "We recently rolled out Stories Everywhere, so that the whole world can easily view Stories on the web. We\u2019ve also started bringing Snaps to bigger screens like stadium jumbotrons at this year\u2019s Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl. Removing friction from the way people use Snapchat and view Snaps will help us continue to grow our community over the coming year. One of the things that makes Snapchat so unique is our Camera and how frequently it is used by our community. This is different from many other services where content is uploaded from other sources rather than created in-app.", "Today, 97% of all the Snaps sent on Snapchat are created using our Camera. With billions of Snaps created every day, we have a unique opportunity to engage our community with augmented reality experiences overlaid on our Camera. Every week, on average, more than half of the entire 13 to 34-year-old population of the United States plays with augmented reality Lenses in Snapchat. We recently expanded our Lenses product with the release of Lens Studio, a set of desktop creative tools that make it easy for anyone to create their own augmented reality experiences and distribute them using Snapchat.", "In just six weeks from launch, over 30,000 Lenses were created by our community and viewed over one billion times. We are blown away by the ingenuity of our community and we can\u2019t wait to see what they create next. We\u2019ll be working hard to expand Lens Studio for years to come. Our content partners continue to shine on Snapchat, and we\u2019re seeing great traction around our new Shows format. In the fourth quarter, more 13 to 34-year-old U.S. viewers watched an average episode of Face Forward by E! on Snapchat than many of the most popular television shows during the same period. Our sports coverage continues to expand, and this season we entertained more than 30 million football fans in the United States with over 400 NFL Stories.", "We\u2019ve built our content business on the belief that sustainable partnerships benefit everyone involved: our partners, our community, and our company. This year we generated over $100 million in revenue for our content partners and we\u2019re excited to deepen these relationships over the coming years. In addition to our ongoing efforts in user growth, augmented reality, and content, we believe that the redesign of our application that we announced on our last call will provide a strong foundation for the evolution of our business.", "That\u2019s because our redesign separates social from media, solving many of the problems that arise when friends are commingled with professional content creators. While we are still very early in the rollout, we are optimistic about the potential to unlock additional growth with the redesign of our application. As expected, it will take time for our community to get used to the changes, but overall, we are pleased with the initial results and will be making the redesign available to our entire community in Q1. There is a lot of work ahead as we optimize the updated application, but our early observations support the thesis behind the new architecture and the many growth opportunities that it provides.", "For example, in one of our first test markets, we saw that the number of Daily Active Users watching Publisher Stories on Discover grew by over 40% when compared to the old design of the application. We also saw gains in ad performance, both in terms of view time and engagement, as well as an overall increase in our Average Revenue Per User when compared to the prior design.", "Additionally, we believe that the redesign has also made our application simpler and easier to use, especially for older users. Compared to the old design, core metrics around content consumption and time spent in the redesigned application are disproportionately higher for users over the age of 35, which bodes well for increasing engagement among older users as we continue to grow our business.", "Our design and engineering teams are constantly monitoring the rollout of the redesign and making improvements based on what we learn from our community and their usage of Snapchat. These adjustments to our products will continue over the next few quarters as we continue to optimize the application.", "Our work during 2017 is proof that we aren\u2019t afraid to make big changes for the long-term success of our business. We redesigned the Snapchat application, transitioned our Snap Ad business to an auction model, and made changes to our team to improve productivity and collaboration. We enter 2018 energized by the opportunities in front of us and excited to deliver against our plan for user growth, augmented reality, and content.", "I\u2019ll now hand over the call to Imran for a discussion of our business results.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi everyone. We had a great fourth quarter. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and 38% quarter-over-quarter. The investments we have made across our advertising business are starting to pay off, and we are pleased with the results we have seen so far. We remained focused on three key areas throughout the year, and I would like to provide an update on each area.", "One, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. First, enhancing our ad product suite. We want to offer ad products that are valuable to all advertisers. This means developing and refining solutions that solve a wide variety of business objectives. Not only does this allow us to serve more advertisers, it also helps us become a one-stop shop for those that continue to invest in our platform.", "Our strategy is paying off. For example, of the Top 100 Ad Age Advertisers that started advertising with us in Q1 of 2016 or earlier, each one of them, at a parent level, also spent with us in 2017 and over 90% of them spent in every quarter of 2017. In Q4, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Story. Our advertising partners have told us that they want a way to spend more time with their audiences. Promoted Story allows brands to take advantage of the familiar stories format that we invented four years ago. It\u2019s been just over a month since launch, and we have seen some amazing Stories from advertisers such as State Farm, Dominos, T-Mobile, and American Express. More importantly, our community is embracing our new format. On average, users that chose to watch Promoted Stories viewed them for over 10 seconds. In the coming weeks, we plan to make this format available in our self-service tools, making it the first Story Ad unit buyable within the Snap Ads auction platform.", "We have also seen strong growth in our direct-response business. In April of last year, we launched the ability to bid for installs in our self-service tools. This allowed advertisers to optimize campaigns for users most likely to install their app. Our ongoing investment in machine learning and our commitment to improving efficiency for advertisers is paying off. We drove 15 times more app installs in December compared to April, while continuing to drive increased return on investment. As we doubled our total revenue from app-install campaigns since the beginning of Q4, we also significantly decreased Cost per Installs for our advertisers.", "One great example of our progress on the direct-response front is Etermax, the creators of the mobile trivia game, Trivia Crack. Using our app-install ads, they were able to acquire high-value, highly engaged users at scale. They saw that Snapchat users were 25% more likely to still play the game after a week, compared to users from other platforms. And overall Snapchat users played the game for twice as long as users acquired anywhere else. Importantly, they were able to achieve these results at a Cost Per Signup and Cost Per Install that was 20% lower than other channels.", "The second area of focus is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We know that in order to truly scale our business, advertising on Snapchat has to be really easy. As Evan mentioned, in Q4, over 90% of Snap Ad impressions were delivered programmatically. In Q4 of 2016, this number was under 10%, so we\u2019re really happy about how quickly our advertisers have embraced this transition and continue to do so. In fact, the number of advertisers spending in the auction doubled quarter-over-quarter.", "We\u2019re also really excited that these self-service tools have allowed us to reach different types of advertisers, not just big brands. Revenue from small and medium-sized businesses more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. For the first time, revenue in Q4 from advertisers outside of Ad Age\u2019s Top 100 exceeded revenue from the Top 100 Advertisers.", "The Penny Hoarder is a great example of an SMB that is growing their business on Snapchat. The Penny Hoarder is a website dedicated to personal finance tips. They came to Snapchat with the goal of finding a new audience that couldn't be reached on other platforms. In just a few months\u2019 time, their Snap Ads campaigns generated 40% higher returns than other platforms and drove a 51% increase in their revenue. We're thrilled by the results they have seen.", "Our self-service tools have also enabled us to quickly scale in international markets. For example, in the Middle East, we made the strategic decision to rely exclusively on our selfserve tools for Snap Ads. Starting on October 1, Snap Ads could only be purchased through Ad Manager, and this decision quickly paid off. In three months, we more than tripled the number of advertisers spending in our auction, and out of all our international offices, this region was our top contributor to overall revenue growth in Q4.", "Still, we have a lot of opportunity to make it even easier for advertisers. Snap Publisher, a web tool for vertical video creation, was a great milestone on the Snap Ads front, and most recently, we took a big step in helping brands with augmented reality. As Evan mentioned, we launched Lens Studio less than two months ago to make it easier for our community and our advertisers to create Lenses. Foot Locker was our first advertiser to leverage Lens Studio to create a Sponsored Lens. They worked with our Lens Studio partner, North Kingdom, on a Lens that was incredibly successful and highly engaging. On average, users played with their Lens for 45 seconds!", "Lastly, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. In Q4, we made a lot of good progress with Snap Pixel. We focused on scaling its usage as well as building out its capabilities. In just two months since its launch, some of the most visited websites have installed the Pixel across thousands of domains. Many of these advertisers were previously not spending with us until we had stronger first-party measurement solutions. One out of every three advertisers that participated in the Q4 Pixel beta spent their first dollar on Snap after they got access to the Pixel.", "The Pixel is helping us to unlock dollars, especially from performance budgets. We think this will continue as we build out additional capabilities, such as dynamic custom audiences, conversion optimization, and secondary objective optimization. We also rolled out Pixel Custom Audiences in December, which allows advertisers to reach audiences based on actions such as visiting their site. It is very early but we\u2019re seeing good results. We still have a lot of work to do here but we\u2019re excited about what this can do, mostly for our midmarket and SMB customers.", "Our focus on online to offline measurement throughout the year helped us capitalize on the holiday season. We know Q4 is a critical time for many of our advertisers, especially retailers, and they want their campaigns to drive store visits and sales. Target partnered with us, using Snap Ads and Filters, to drive action intent and in-store visitation for holiday shopping. We drove a 16 percentage-point lift in action intent to shop at Target for the holidays as measured by Nielsen, as well as over 660,000 incremental visitors to their stores as measured by Snap to Store, which is our proprietary solution that measures foot traffic in stores.", "We continue to invest in our measurement ecosystem and now have 19 third-party measurement partners. In Q4, we partnered with the National Research Group, a leading data provider in the movie industry, to understand the impact that our ad campaigns have on opening weekend box office. Our ongoing partnership demonstrates that Snapchatters represent 36% of moviegoers and 50% of ticket sales.", "Additionally, movies that advertise on Snapchat are 22% more likely to be moviegoers\u2019 first choice in theaters on the opening weekend, a metric that is highly correlated to opening weekend box office. We\u2019re really happy with the progress we made in 2017. We still have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re excited to keep the momentum going.", "Thank you for the time today, and here\u2019s Drew to discuss our financial results.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon everyone. Simply put, our fourth quarter results represented a major step forward for Snap, both financially and operationally. Overall, we saw improvements across our business, but I will comment on four specific areas of interest for Q4.", "First, revenues increased 72% year-over-year and 37% sequentially, anchored by growing auction traction and holiday brand sales. Revenues for the year more than doubled, up 104%. Second, gross margin expanded substantially, which continues to validate that our business model can scale profitably. As Evan noted, gross margins were 36%, improving over 2,700 basis points year-over-year and up 1,400 basis points in just one quarter.", "Third, headcount growth continues to moderate, thanks to productivity gains from our team. Net additions in the quarter were slightly more than 100, one-third of the rate of recent quarters. And fourth, cash burn declined 49% sequentially, driven by more focused capital deployment priorities and thoughtful cash management.", "I will now expand on each. First, global revenues grew to $286 million in the fourth quarter. We saw growth in every region, and international markets now represent 23% of our total revenue, up from 12% a year ago and 20% last quarter.", "As expected, the fastest growing product in Q4 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold through the auction. Many of the auction dynamics were consistent with prior quarters, although ad volumes were much higher in Q4. It was very encouraging to see some substantial daily sales volumes flowing through the auction during the quarter.", "As expected, revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing, which fell sequentially due to the mix shift from managed to programmatic and reserved to bidded ads.", "Let me share some numbers with you on impressions and pricing. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Promoted Stories, were up 90% sequentially and up over 575% year-over-year. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Promoted Stories, was down more than 15% sequentially, and nearly 70% year-over-year.", "Third, we ended the quarter with over 90% of our ads served programmatically, up from 80% in the prior quarter. Over the medium term, we believe that increasing our advertiser count will have a positive impact on our pricing. In the quarter, we saw the percentage of contested auctions increase versus the prior quarter, and auctions that were contested continued to have higher prices than single-bidded auctions.", "Now, looking at our key cost drivers, we are excited to continue to see our economic model gaining traction: growing revenues coupled with banded user expenses fueled gross margin expansion again in Q4.", "Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures including gross margins, they will exclude stock based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "The cost leverage we are seeing is particularly apparent on a per user basis. In Q4, our ARPU increased 46% year-over-year to $1.53, while our costs per user, or CoRPU, only increased 2%, to $0.98. We\u2019ve been able to moderate user cost growth through the successful execution of our multi cloud strategy. Specifically, hosting costs per user dropped from $0.72 a year ago to $0.70 in the quarter. That's great progress in a year when our sales have more than doubled and engagement metrics have grown substantially.", "As a result, worldwide gross margins expanded to 36%. Internal analyses continue to suggest our economic model can scale well as North American gross margins are well above the worldwide average, driven by their higher ARPU, which was $2.75 in the quarter.", "Now moving down the income statement, the primary driver for operating expenses remains people cost. In the quarter, our hiring pace slowed substantially. Specifically, net adds were slightly more than 100, as we started to lever our significant early investments in people.", "Hiring mix remains a priority, and the absolute number of back-office employees declined in Q4. Overall operating expenses were up 17% sequentially, driven by modest hiring, increased sales commissions, legal costs, and year-end expenses.", "Lastly, we focused on capital deployment priorities and thoughtfully managed our cash position this quarter. CapEx remained modest at $21 million and less than $85 million for the year, driven by our capital light infrastructure strategy. Our CapEx per user for the year was less than $0.50, which we believe leads the industry.", "M&A was modest in the quarter, and we adopted a sell-to-cover approach for vested restricted stock units for employees during the quarter, which substantially reduced our cash spend. As a result, we were able to reduce our cash burn by 49% sequentially. We ended 2017 with $2 billion in cash and marketable securities.", "As of December 31, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1,222 million and 1,420 million on a fully diluted basis. Q4 represented a significant step forward for Snap on the key financial metrics. As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to manage our business for the long term. In 2018, there is much to do and we are focused to deliver on our key priorities.", "I want to share some financial thoughts with you for the early part of the year. First, as we think about revenue growth in Q1 2018, we start with the current momentum in the business. Specifically, we saw strong growth in Q4, and our year-over-year advertising revenue growth rate accelerated to 74%. In Q1, we are planning for our year-over-year revenue growth rate to moderate from the Q4 pace. The majority of our revenue is generated through brand advertising, which seasonally peaks in the fourth quarter.", "Additionally, we are planning for the transition of the creative tools business to the programmatic platform, which we believe will drive additional impressions at lower prices and result in more modest growth in the first half of 2018. Also note that in Q1 2017, we had $8 million of Spectacles revenue which we are planning to be substantially down year-over-year and sequentially.", "On hosting expenses, we exited the fourth quarter with a slightly higher cost per DAU than the quarterly average of $0.70. The cost impact of our application redesign has yet to be fully determined. That said, we are focused on executing additional cost saving initiatives in 2018 to continue to offset future cost increases.", "With respect to operating expenses, we are planning for continued gains in team productivity and modest hiring. We are planning for operating-expense growth to moderate in the first half of 2018 and be up low double digits versus the second half of 2017, primarily driven by more focused hiring in front-of-house functions.", "Please note that this does not include any potential acquisitions. Capital expenditures were less than $85 million in 2017, and we are planning for a slight increase in 2018. We are moving many of our headquarter teams to a series of leased facilities in Santa Monica during the first half of the year, although we do expect additional moves to occur later in the year and into 2019 as well.", "With that, I will now turn the line back to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, after your initial question is asked your line will be muted. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.", "And our first question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler", "Great, thanks. Just two questions. One for Evan and one for Imran. Evan you mentioned that Android retention is up 20% quarter-on-quarter. Can you just give us some color on what\u2019s driving that? And then you also said that engagement in the older cohorts and with \u2013 and with discover is up pretty big following the redesign. So how does the engagement Snaps compare with younger cohorts versus the older cohorts?", "And then second question for Imran, we saw some news in the upfront that you guys have secured as much as $70 million in ad revenue for the winter Olympics. So can you just talk about how much of that of flow through Snap and how that kind of triangulates with the comments about the first quarter? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Ross. Yeah, I think in my comments earlier I talked about a year-over-year increase in retention. We have been working very hard to provide more value to our users when they sign-up and one of the key ways that we do this is try to make sure that they have a lot of great friends ready for them. So we rolled out quick out over this year, and that\u2019s made a huge difference on making sure that folks who sign up, get the friends they need quickly. I can\u2019t provide any detail on cohorts but we\u2019re excited with the progress we have been making on Android.", "Imran Khan", "So on the Olympic side, Ross, let me jump on that one. So we are very excited to have a special event like the winter Olympics. And we believe Snap, the community will really enjoy what we have there. We\u2019re excited to be the biggest mobile partner there. Obviously, it\u2019s an extension of a success or strong overall partnership we have with NBCUniversal and it builds on the success that we had with the summer Olympics back in 2016.", "So as our business is growing, we look to these tentpole events as engagement drivers and when we do financial drivers. And so our core business today is much bigger than it was back in the summer of 2016. Now we have been working with advertisers and our ad packages have sold well, so we do expect modest revenue tailwind in Q1. But overall percentage revenue boost to our sales base we expect to be less than what it was a couple of years ago when we had a smaller business.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.", "Stephen Ju", "Okay, thanks. Imran, I recall you were saying, I think it was two quarters ago that you\u2019re looking to evangelize the platform and lowering advertisers or cheaper price inventory. You have touched on this to some degree on the prepared remarks, but \u2013 around the Pixel, but how are the conversations going now? Do you still feel like you have to sell the benefits of advertising of Snap especially for the DR guys? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think, the conversation is going really well as evident by our Q4 result. And I think a couple of things happening. Number one, we are really offering very attractive value to our advertisers on our platform given our size and scale and you are seeing that more and more advertisers are coming to our platform and number of advertisers and auction doubled in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. The second thing is on a direct response side, we are seeing great success on app install and lead generation and we are aggressively moving into e-commerce customers with the launch of Pixel and early trend looks really good and we are really excited about that.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Justin Post", "Great, nice revenue quarter. A couple of questions for you. Maybe Imran, the ad impressions were up 575%. Is that all just demand generated or did the company make a decision to open up more ad impressions this year? And how much \u2013 do you just feel like you have tremendous rooms still to grow there? And then maybe a question for Drew, you have on that a little bit. But was there any just unusual item in the fourth quarter as far as revenues that we should be thinking about that that might not sustained into next year? Thank you.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah, with 170 million \u2013 187 million daily active users who are incredibly engaged. We have a lot of inventory on our platform and we think there are still a lot of room for us to grow.", "Drew Vollero", "So, and Justin \u2013 hey, it\u2019s Drew. On the revenue side of the world, we did try to call out a couple of those in my comments. We are a brand business and we do believe that the brand business seasonally peaks in the fourth quarter. So that was something we wanted to highlight as you think about the early part of the year. Also as you think about the early part of the year, our spectacles business was $8 million last year in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect that business to annualize or even sequentially comp to where it has been.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark Mahaney", "I want to try to get at the question of the sustainability of two trends, the DAU trends and the revenue growth trends. And I guess I would like to ask it in \u2013 in the first in the DAU trends in terms of the how far you think you are along in terms of kind of \u201cfixing the Android of problems\u201d or the crash where are the crash levels were versus where you have had them before? I know in the past you talked about having that all finalized by Q2 of this you. Do you think you are already there? So is there any more you need to do with Android in order to get that experience like you wanted?", "And then on the revenue side, I guess the one thing I\u2019d add there is it sounds like you\u2019re already through all of the auctions \u2013 the transition to the auction process. So I would think that this kind of growth rates that we\u2019re seeing leaving aside seasonality is relatively sustainable. But anything else you would want to do to caution us on extrapolating the growth from here other than the seasonality and the spectacles?", "Evan Spiegel", "So on the DAU side; obviously we talked a lot in 2017 about Android and how much we have focused on it. And today we have some of the lowest ever crash rates that we have seen, but we\u2019re still going to be doing a lot of work to rebuild the Android application. There are components of that in the updated discover functionality and it\u2019s rolling out in the redesign and so that\u2019s great to see. The frame dropping has gone away. The scroll performance is awesome and streaming is making huge difference for people who are watching content of our service. So I think that\u2019s a great step in the right direction, especially with the resign, but you will see a lot more this year and we have been chopping a lot of word on that for a long-time as you know.", "Drew Vollero", "It\u2019s Drew here. Hey a couple of thoughts for you on the overall business, Mark. So in terms of the revenue growth drivers, we didn\u2019t talk about the seasonality, we talked about the spectacles, spectacle as a smaller piece. Overall, the way that you should think about the business is really that the engine that drove the growth in the fourth quarter will continue to drive our growth really is the option platform that\u2019s really where things are heading. There is a smaller piece of our business on the creative tools side. We will be transitioning that in the first half of the year as we transition that we do expect to see gains and impression offset by declines in prices, but really sort of as you are thinking about big picture ideas and where our business is going, what\u2019s the business drivers are, it really is going to be Snap Ads and the auction for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Heath Terry", "Great, thanks. Evan, how do you experienced with the redesign impact in a way that you\u2019re planning product development? Where and how has it impacted your priorities? And then Drew just a quick one. Given the progress on cash burn, how should we be thinking about your trajectory there going forward?", "Evan Spiegel", "We decoupled the redesign from a lot of the feature development that we have been working on, so that\u2019s continued and I am very excited about the product pipeline for this year. The redesign is really focused on three things. We want to make the app easier to use. We want to bring your friends together and we want to elevate a lot of the great content that we have and discover. And so far I think we have accomplished all three and we have tried to be very deliberate. In the rollout, we have learned a lot as we have rolled it out. It's out now about 40 million folks and we\u2019re excited on the progress there. So we will be working on a lot of that throughout the year and for the years to come, but that\u2019s decoupled from the feature development process internally.", "Drew Vollero", "And Heath on the working capital or just general of the cash burn of the business, obviously big picture cash is very important to us, liquidity is something that we look at all the time. If you think about sort of the uses of cash for the business, we\u2019re EBITDA negative and investments in business operations continue to be our number one capital deployment priority. Our second capital deployment priorities, M&A, it\u2019s opportunistic as you know. So sometimes we do stuffs, sometimes we don\u2019t. I do think we can do a better job of thinking about cash versus stock mix as we do that. But I think we\u2019re still in the M&A game and we will be periodically looking at deals. I do think the big change we made between the third and fourth quarter was really we stopped buying back employee shares here in the fourth quarter and that was a big piece of what the change in cash burn was.", "I also think we did a better job of managing our working capital within the balance sheet and that\u2019s just the maturing business getting better than what it does. So, overall, it\u2019s really going to be the investment in the business and the M&A our capital deployments and those are the primary uses of cash.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Hey, guys. Congrats on the solid results. This is actually Matt chiming in on Lloyd\u2019s behalf. The question, two questions, really, one with the Android developments, could you talk about where you saw the engagement increase? Was it pretty uniform across your geographies or are there any differences to call out there? And two for any advertisers, who might have been with you that have been since left?", "What were the key challenges that they faced? And have those challenges been addressed whether that\u2019s targeting ROIs like a measurability, maybe not finding the right demographic, any color there would be helpful.", "Evan Spiegel", "So with the advertiser strike I think we've made tremendous progress in delivering things that advertisers are looking for. We made tremendous progress on app install side, tremendous problem \u2013 progress on lead generation side and we also launched Pixel. And I think a lot of the advertisers, primary who were on the e-commerce segment are looking for Pixel to really understand how we are driving growth. And I think that's the one big area that we continue to invest.", "The other area is that we have continued to remain really focused to buying add on Snapchat absolutely easy. And we did make a lot of progress with Snap publishers and we are going to continue to do so and that will also continue to drive growth. But overall, we are very happy with the progress we made and going to continue to do so. And in terms of Android geography, we saw improvement across the geographies. So there\u2019s no one specific geographic to point that out.", "Operator", "The next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on the advertising. The way you guys break up the business in talking about it between managed, versus programmatic, to reserved, versus bided, is there any chance you can give us color about the skew in terms of percentage of revenue that tilts one way or the other? And also the differences in price between the two so we could get a better sense of where we are in the transition on the revenue base and on the pricing mix in the business? Thanks so much.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes with regards to breaking down revenue by channel, we don't do that. But I think one thing I believe Drew pointed out that programmatic was the fastest growing segment of the business as evident by the number of impression that is flowing through the programmatic business.", "With regards to pricing, I think, we really focus here to drive return on investment for advertisers. If we drive more return on investment for advertisers that means more advertisers will come to our platform. We're just getting started, there are 26 million small businesses out there, we want to capture a big chunk of that. So we are less focused on price, more focused on driving value and driving growth.", "But in general right even an advertiser wants to reserve a date that always have high price than bided pricing. So that's how usually it works.", "Operator", "And our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "John Blackledge", "Great, thank you. So the user growth was better than expected. I'm just wondering if you have any color on engagement, time spent on the platform, and how you think about kind of the key engagement drivers in 2018? And then just a quick one on the total number of advertisers on the platform. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't have any material updates for you on engagement, but I did see I yesterday Verizon releasing numbers about their customers\u2019 usage during the Super Bowl. And I guess last year we were number three in terms of overall usage during the Super Bowl and this year we were number one. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that directionally, but no specific updates for you today.", "Imran Khan", "In terms of the total number of advertisers on the platform, obviously it's a key accelerator for our business. We know when we get more competition on the auction we take it. So we\u2019re aware that we can drive pricing over the medium turn. We did double the number of advertisers on the platform, we're still a young business with a lot of room to grow, but we're excited by the progress in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Thanks for taking the question. I have two first for Drew or Imran, can you just help us understand how your longstanding kind of existing advertisers are behaving in a reserved media world versus auction just how their behavior is shifting And then secondly, Evan you talked a couple times about removing friction, what are the opportunities that you're thinking about in 2018 to continue doing that? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Hi, thanks Doug. I think if you look at the large advertisers, they have different buckets of budgets, right. So they have always on budget, they have activation budget surrounding some events like Super Bowl, they have new initiative budgets. And what we're trying to do is play into all of those buckets and trying to capture dollar. So with regards to always on budget that's the money we are getting on to our auction platform, to our self-service platform. But then we also have this incredible ad unit tools like lenses and filters that\u2019s really unique and no other platform has that at scale like us. And you can see that large advertisers take advantage of those products or take advantage of our premium products like for shows and discover to surrounding some events or deliver some message. They want to do that to as part of their premium content strategy. Like Super Bowl, I think, I don't know if you saw that, we had a couple of great lenses and that did really, really well. And we are really, really excited about that.", "Drew Vollero", "On the removing friction mandate over here, I think, one of the key things is all of the new processes we have around quality and performance that will continue to make a big difference for us and were obviously a big focus of last year. But also we have some major architectural changes coming to both IOS and android, coming throughout the year and we're excited about the opportunities there.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Thanks. I have two. I think the first for Drew and then the next one Evan. Getting back to the question a lot of people have asked around the outlook for Q1 revenue we can obviously kind of back out spectacle impact. And brand I guess is seasonal like you said, so it should be \u2013 the seasonality should have reflected in the year ago. So I guess I'm just trying to understand coming off of a strong Q4 with accelerating trends the auction dynamics, et cetera that are benefiting you. Why would you \u2013 what is sort of driver of the \u201cmoderating growth\u201d in Q1? It seems like you've got some nice tailwinds on a year-on-year basis, ex Spectacles, going into Q1.", "And then for Evan there have been some other players, some other social apps in the space that have kind of admitted that some of the ways that their users are using their apps may not always be deemed good uses of time, right more around focusing going for more on quality versus quantity. I wonder if that's something that you think is in any parts of SnapChat an issue and anything that you're sort of addressing from that perspective? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So let me comment on the first question. So we did comment on the underlying drivers for the spike up that we did see in the fourth quarter. And we did share we\u2019re thinking internally about the Q1 dynamics. The largest piece of our revenue for our business in Q4 remains brand sales. And we believe brand revenue seasonally peaks in Q4. And so as the business now has more scale, we believe year-over-year growth rates are probably the most relevant way to think about our business. We think it neutralizes the brand seasonality and it's frankly our team thinks about managing its business.", "So we're thinking about that a year-over-year growth rate and that's why I try to target that 74%, so you get a sense on that. But what we did try to do was point out some of that underlying drivers, the seasonality, the change in some of the creative that we moved to self-serve and then a little bit which is a smaller piece of the business on the spectacle side. So we try to give you some thoughts. Those are the big movers if you think about our business in the first quarter.", "And on the product side from the beginning we've been really thoughtful about how we approach these issues, it's one of the reasons why we've never had public facing metrics around followers or likes and why we've always tried to control the distributes content very widely on our platform.", "And I think if you look at the redesign the evolution with the redesign, what we're trying to say is that there's a really big difference between talking to your friends on the telephone and broadcasting on a TV channel. And I think our society has noticed that difference for a really long time and that's why there's different regulations and rules around communicating with your friends and broadcasting media. And so for us, as we evolve the product, I think this allows us to really reinforce the great things about our communications product, bring friends closer together and at the same time provide more distribution to really high quality content.", "So I think we're trying to stay way ahead of the curve on this stuff and it\u2019s the thing we care a lot about.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Jason Helfstein", "Thanks, two questions. So you did share a good amount of learnings on the app redesign. Are you getting input from advertisers and agencies? So kind of how deep is the learnings going? And then it does seem like brand will be a lower percent of the mix going forward between brand, DR and then large versus small advertisers. So if any thoughts about how to think about the mix of advertisers going forward and kind of the benefits of greater diversification, thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, we are taking a feedback from advertisers and advertisers and agencies, a perfect example of Promoted Stories. Agencies and advertisers always told us that they wanted a new way to tell their stories, and that's why we launched Promoted Stories and we're thrilled with the success we are seeing and really, really excited about the opportunity.", "The second question was around mix shift between brand and DR. I think for the first time in Company\u2019s history more than 50% of our revenue came from advertisers who were outside the Ad Age Top 100. As we said there are 26 million or so large and small businesses out there and there's a tremendous opportunity to help those advertisers to be successful and they are looking for ways to reach new users and we can help them. And so we really dedicated to focus \u2013 as we do that, you will see that the mix will change and that will also muted seasonality in the business hopefully in the long term.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Youssef Squali", "All right. Two questions, please. Starting with Drew, on the cost side, can you shed some more light into the strength in the gross margin, components of that and more importantly, as we look into 2018, it looks like 2017 had a lot of noise to it from a gross margin side. How should we be thinking about the seasonality on that line? And then Evan, GDPR requires changes to the consent recommendation is around kids 16 and under, I know, international is a relatively small percentage of the overall business. But how do you envision this effect in Snap\u2019s on boarding process and just any other potential fallout from GDPR or not? Thanks.", "Drew Vollero", "So let me speak to some of the wins that are happening on gross margin, you\u2019re right. Gross margins have been expanding here and been expanding for a while, we did have a terrific quarter, gross margins went from 21% sequentially up to 36% and a similar expansion on a year-over-year basis. Really it\u2019s \u2013 we have a powerful model when we can get incremental sales here. And so if you think about the marginal cost to serve here, it\u2019s not high. And so simply put, sales have been growing a lot faster than within our costs on a variable side, which has been terrific.", "Our cost structure really on the variable side as infrastructure costs and rev share both of which were been heading in the right direction. Our infrastructure costs are down $0.72 last year to $0.70, we\u2019re just doing an excellent job of executing on a multi-cloud strategy, we\u2019re winning there. And obviously, we\u2019re taking the capital out of the business as we deal with so that\u2019s really two wins that we\u2019ve been executing on the infrastructure side.", "On the rev share side, as we continue to open up more owned inventory that those incremental sales dollars come without a rev share. So that\u2019s really been helping manage down the revenue share percentages, it was 14% of sales last year, now it\u2019s 10% and we\u2019ve seen good leverage on that all along. So really it\u2019s a powerful combination of growing revenues and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of flattening the costs in marginal cost. And so you\u2019ve seen the expansion of the gross margin over the last six quarters, it\u2019s been nice progress.", "Evan Spiegel", "On the GDPR front something that we are ready for and we\u2019ve been very thoughtful about how we approach privacy in our product. Obviously, things like the right to be forgotten are close to our heart. It's something that we have a very serious focus on.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one for Evan. Evan, you were talking about kind of the trying to stay a step ahead of everyone else, when you think about the product. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of questions from investors about the kind of the rational for the redesign and how much of it was something you saw that you didn\u2019t like and use your behavior or was it trying to meet advertiser demand? And it seems like you\u2019re trying to portray as, this was more of nothing was wrong, we just believe we can be better. I just want to \u2013 could you maybe just set the record straight to confirm that the rational driving the redesign.", "And then just a question for Imran and Drew. You obviously exceeded Wall Street expectations for Q4, but as you think forward for a full year 2018, I think, if you look back to the IPO expectations were for roughly $2 billion of revenue in 2018. That\u2019s now down to call it a $3 billion at least before today\u2019s call and while I know you don\u2019t give guidance. Wondering how you feel about the level of consensus out there in terms of ability for the company to meet or exceed the way you did in Q4?", "Evan Spiegel", "Hey, Rich. We\u2019re always trying to improve the product and we\u2019re pretty relentless about it. We see here huge amount of opportunity both in the redesign, but also all the other stuff. That we are working on and obviously, it\u2019s what we want to do. So we\u2019re really excited about our work there.", "Drew Vollero", "In terms of the overall thoughts for the year, Rich, and look the Snap Ad sold through the auction that are going to continue to be our main revenue driver in 2018. The auction continues to be new for us, where there\u2019s lots of optimizing going behind the scenes, every single day on pricing, on targeting et cetera. But there are a series of new technologies, enablers, accelerators like the Pixel by targeting improvements, new products. But they should be accelerated for our business, but it\u2019s difficult to predict when they\u2019re going to be ready. And so as a result, our revenue visibility is really more in the near-term. And so that\u2019s why we shared some thoughts with you as it relates to the first quarter on the underlying drivers of the business. And so that\u2019s the visibility that we have comfort with at this point. So that\u2019s why we share those thoughts.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Thanks. I think you guys got assist before maybe a couple quarters ago. I would think I\u2019ll add with the strength that you\u2019re seeing in self-serve and we thought about opening up the auction to third-party DSPs to increase the number of advertisers to get it\u2019s more pricing point be there platform. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think when you open it up to third-party DSP providers that are always a risk that some of the user ideas will leak our platform, and I think we have really, really focused on user privacy. And ultimately that\u2019s a very, very important part of it. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re interested in doing that. I think what\u2019s really makes great that \u2013 effort anybody can logon to our platform and buy advertisement. And there are a lot of advertisers, who are looking to acquire new customers and we do our strength in the millennials market, right, 70% of 13 to 34 in U.S., UK, France on those markets are on our platform. And so we\u2019re really excited that what we can offer and I think that\u2019s a great way to grow our business without compromising potential privacy issues.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Egbert with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "John Egbert", "Thanks. I had a couple questions on maps. I was wondering how maps fit into the redesign. Are you seeing increased used of maps and/or stories you didn\u2019t maps for the test users. That you\u2019re tracking. Is it a priority to make maps usage more friction less and redesign. And then on monetization on \u2013 it seems likes stories of reviewed from maps on the interface are still on monetize. There at least a very under monetized. Should we expect to see that change anytime soon or what type of criteria are you evaluating there? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "We\u2019re really excited about maps and we have over 100 million monthly active users from Maps. And we'll be working on improving the frequency with which people use that product, mostly by trying to provide more value around using the maps experience. Today, it\u2019s hard to know where to go, it\u2019s hard to navigate interesting things that are happening. And so as we improve the product, we will make it easier for you to find the most interesting things that happened on your map. So I think a lot of work to do there, of course, and we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re bubbling it up higher, obviously in the redesign. On monetization, we\u2019re not currently monetizing maps and nothing to share on that front.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask about international expansion, I think Imran and Evan you mentioned about working with carrier partners internationally, and then also selling ads through Snap Ads through Ad manager in newer markets like the Middle East. So just wanted understand, if there\u2019s maybe a little bit of change in strategy, in terms of focusing on the top ad markets globally or just looking at launching everywhere? And then in terms of moderating headcount, just really quick, if you could provide any sort of insight on reducing the friction or improving I think productivity gains \u2013 you mentioned back office employees declined, but is there any change in sales structure given the strength in the auction. Thank you.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think with as our business becoming more and more programmatic ourselves forces becoming a consultant to our clients. And I think that is very important, because I think, we have a still lot of work to do to educate the market. And really teach the market, how to create vertical video, audio that really works on mobile environment. Many of our advertising partners are really waiting by creating great ad content and really understanding how to take advantage of our platform. And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest on that and I think that\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for us to capture market share by doing so.", "With regards to international market, look I think international is a great opportunity more and more advertisers in the international market wants to use Snapchat to reach their audience and we continue to be aggressive drilling out of the market that we think we can generate profitable revenue growth.", "Evan Spiegel", "As I going to say Ron as we\u2019ve been building up to the 3,000 here, the north star really has been add to the front of house and leverage the back of the house as much as we can. To your point, we saw that in the back of the house for the fourth quarter, but we have been able to move the mix front of house with engineering in sales, it\u2019s now over 80% of the people at the company that\u2019s by design. And so really those remain our strategic priorities. We are going to be focusing hiring to your point as we move forward. But those remain high priorities for us.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call.

Welcome to Snap Inc.'s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2018, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We began 2018 with several major Snapchat updates, and we continue to make progress in growing our advertising business and building tools for advertisers.", "This quarter, we rolled out the redesign of our application. This new design is driven by our fundamental belief that separating friends from professional content creators is important to both our mission and the long-term growth of our business.", "For example, we have known for a long time that creating public-facing content is a very different behavior from interacting with close friends, which makes it challenging for both to exist successfully in the same ecosystem. Before the redesign, Stories were sorted by recency, meaning that people who post most frequently were usually at the top of the list. Naturally, the most frequently-posting users tended to be people who create content as part of their job, compared to users who are just sharing their day with friends. As our community continued to grow, keeping friends and creators in the same feed made Snapchat feel less personal, because close friends were constantly buried below creators.", "We addressed these issues by separating friends from creators and by making it easier to find Stories from the people closest to you. Now personal friends no longer have to compete with creators, and people can find Stories based on the depth of their relationships rather than who is posting most often. We also built a new home for creators in a newly expanded Discover section. This enables us to properly invest in products, discovery, and monetization for our creators, while also supporting a larger variety of content on Snapchat. The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both.", "As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption, especially given the high frequency of daily engagement of our community. While we had an average of 191 million daily active users in Q1, our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average. We are already starting to see early signs of stabilization among our iOS users as people get used to the changes, but still have a lot of work to do to optimize the new design, especially for our Android users. Our time spent remained more than 30 minutes per day on average following the redesign, and we have also started to realize some of the positive benefits, including increased new user retention for older users.", "We are now focused on optimizing the redesign based on our ongoing experimentation and learning. For example, when we separated friends\u2019 Stories from creator Stories, we also moved them to the left side of the camera and merged them into the Chat feed. We learned that combining watching Stories and communicating with friends into the same place made it harder to optimize for both competing behaviors. We are currently rolling out an update to address this by sorting communication by recency and moving Stories from friends to the right side of the application, while maintaining the structural changes we have made around separating friends from creators and sorting friends\u2019 Stories by relationships. The redesign created a lot of new opportunities, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to refine and improve Snapchat.", "This overall process is indicative of how we approach product development at Snap. We start with a core belief that builds on our mission of empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. In this case, it is our long-standing belief that separating social interactions from media content encourages people to create and share Snaps with each other, while also providing better opportunities and incentives for media partners. We then build and optimize our products around these underlying values, prioritizing them over short-term growth. ", "While doing so can often lead our company to take bigger risks and endure the accompanying volatility, we do this for two reasons. First, we firmly believe that it\u2019s the right thing to do for our community, because it ensures that our various products maintain a cohesive vision and stay true to our mission. Second, starting from first principles often leads us to create novel and unexpected experiences, which naturally tend to be longer-term opportunities that are difficult to optimize based on short-term results. ", "For example, our focus on self-expression and living in the moment from the very beginning took a long time for people to understand and get used to, but over the years has helped Snapchat become one of the most-used cameras in the world, with more than 60% of our daily active users creating Snaps with our camera, even as we doubled our user base over the past 2.5 years. Furthermore, one of the great things about our software products is that we can modify and update them any time. This makes it easier for us to take these risks, knowing that we are constantly learning and optimizing our products to better achieve our mission over the long term.", "Android performance is still a weakness for us, but we are making significant progress. Given the volume of changes we made with the redesign, a number of performance regressions contributed to a disproportionately negative impact among Android users, and we are currently working on addressing them. While the investments we made in our performance automation systems have significantly improved the speed and scale at which we are able to identify and fix these kinds of issues, our legacy codebase remains a problem. ", "I\u2019m really excited about the new version of the Android application that I talked about last year, which has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be lightweight, performant, and modular, which we hope will alleviate many of the performance-related issues we see with new product launches and updates. We have been testing the rebuilt application internally and we have quite a bit more work to do before our expected launch in Q3 of this year. In the meantime, we are incorporating some of the new modular components like Discover and the Friend Feed into the existing application, which we hope will improve performance in the near term.", "We continue to lead in mobile content and augmented reality, with a lot of progress in both this quarter. During the Winter Olympics, more than 81 million people watched our coverage on Discover in nine different languages, quickly surpassing the reach of our Rio Summer Olympics coverage. In the United States alone, over 10 million people on average tuned in every day at the Games. The redesign also enabled us to experiment with our first live streaming experience so that our users could watch key moments of the Olympics in real time wherever they were.", "Additionally, our content is starting to find its way outside of our application and into the world. During March Madness, Snaps submitted to Our Story appeared on stadium jumbotrons at each of the 67 games, as well as on local and national broadcast television coverage of the tournament. Over 200 media organizations have featured Snaps or embedded the Snap Map in their online, social, and broadcast television channels since we enabled the functionality just a few months ago. We believe that broadening the distribution of the unique Snaps created by our community will inspire more people to download Snapchat and create Snaps using our camera.", "We expanded our augmented reality platform and offerings significantly this quarter. Lens Studio has seen incredible adoption. Over 200 of the Lenses created by our community were viewed over 1 million times in the few months since launch. Our community has used these tools in ways we would have never imagined, and they have inspired us to invest more in empowering their creativity. We recently upgraded Lens Studio to now support the creation of new experiences like soundboards, interactive paths, and face Lenses. We\u2019re also expanding the underlying architecture of Lenses with Snappables, our latest Lens format that helps our community collaborate and interact with their friends through augmented reality experiences.", "Despite some headwinds from our redesign, our advertising business has continued to grow. While our decision to migrate our Snap Ads business to our programmatic auction led to a short-term slowdown in our revenue growth last year, we made the transition quickly and the company is far better for it. We are now better able to manage and optimize our overall advertising business and auction dynamics, which has accelerated the pace with which we can improve ROI for our advertisers. In Q1, both the average cost per app install and the average cost per swipe in the United States were well under half of what they were the year before, and we are continuing to make improvements.", "Our self-serve products helped us increase the number of advertisers actively spending on our platform by 20 times over the past year, and we still have a lot of opportunity to expand from here. With a growing advertiser base, we are now also introducing both paid and organic tools and experiences for companies of all sizes. Snapcodes unlock experiences like creative tools and sticker packs, and we are seeing brands experimenting with Lens Studio to create unique campaigns. Additionally, our product roadmap for empowering creators will also benefit small and large businesses alike and give them a better organic presence on our service.", "Our total revenue for the quarter was $230.7 million, up 54% from last year. Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners. We believe that our current path forward will address both issues, and that our advertising business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from the tough decisions we make in order to create and maintain a positive and healthy environment for our community over the long term.", "Thanks again for joining the call, and I will now turn it over to Imran to talk about our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi, everyone. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $229 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year. Evan talked about the philosophy behind the redesign, which is ongoing and a learning process. In Q1, we learned a lot based on how our users reacted to the redesign. But because of that, we also experienced some short-term disruptions to the business. The rapid pace at which we changed the core product introduced increased volatility into our ads marketplace. While we did not grow as quickly as we wanted, our Snap Ad revenue grew 102% year-over-year, and was down only 6% sequentially in a seasonally tough quarter.", "Additionally, during the quarter, we had many conversations with our advertisers about the redesign. These have been challenging conversations, as we made the proactive and deliberate decision to prioritize our long-term consumer product goals over our short-term monetization goals. The impact was primarily felt in our Sponsored Creative Tools business. On top of the expected seasonally weaker demand, our Lens and Filter products, which generally have a higher average selling price, were challenged by a negative market narrative.", "We\u2019re also in the middle of transitioning these products to a programmatic, audience-based buy model, which has negatively impacted the average order value, or AOV, for the products. For example, in Q1, the total number of Lenses sold was up 16% year-over-year, but AOV was down 37%. This is similar to what we experienced during our Snap Ad transition. As we transition all products to our self-service tool, we believe we can drive broader advertiser adoption and ultimately, a long-term, sustainable business.", "While we anticipate that some of these factors may continue to impact our business in Q2, I\u2019m very excited about the second half of this year. This is because of the progress we are making in our three focus areas: number one, enhancing our ad product suite, two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers, and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. In December, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Stories, which allows advertisers to leverage the familiar Stories format that our community knows and loves. But, to better reflect the storytelling capabilities of this format, we\u2019re now calling them Story Ads. We recently brought Story Ads to our self-service tool so that advertisers can use the same advanced targeting that they use for Snap Ads. Since launching this format in the auction, users that chose to watch Story Ads viewed them for an average of over 20 seconds. We believe this is a strong indication that our community is continuing to embrace this format.", "On the direct response side, we continue to make great progress. We believe that when we show the right ad to the right user, it creates a win-win situation. Swipe rates are one indication of whether or not we are creating this win-win situation. Quarter-over-quarter, for campaigns optimized for swipes, we increased our swipe rates by 8 percentage points, while also increasing total swipes by nearly 14 percentage points. This is a testament to the great work that our ad ranking team is doing to show the right ad to the right person.", "We\u2019re also continuing to evolve our formats, and I\u2019m really excited about our recent launch of shoppable Augmented Reality. Since bringing Lenses to market in 2015, we have seen this product drive tons of engagement and even create pop culture moments. But we wanted to bring the power of creative tools to our direct response advertisers. While users are playing with a Lens in the camera, advertisers can now include a button that will redirect them to a long-form video, website, or the app store. The first brands to try this new format include sports company Adidas, maker of the Candy Crush video games King, and make-up brand Clairol. As we scale adoption of this product, we are confident that it will help accelerate the growth of our Lens business as well.", "Our second area of focus is developing efficient tools for advertisers. As we have outlined before, one of our key priorities is to grow our SMB, or Online Sales, business. The vast majority of businesses are SMBs, and they are increasingly adopting digital marketing platforms to grow their businesses. In order to onboard these advertisers, we have been rolling out our self-serve tools and investing to create a frictionless ad buying experience. We made good progress this quarter as evidenced by 30% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for our SMB business.", "We are also launching sophisticated tools for our large advertisers. For example, we recently launched our Reach and Frequency tool for Snap Ads to a handful of select advertisers in the US and UK. This has been a key request from advertisers looking to plan and buy in advance on Snapchat. Only a few other scaled platforms have brought this tool to market, and it offers predictable delivery and pricing, something that is very valuable for larger brand-focused campaigns. ", "We launched Reach and Frequency within our self-service platform and are partnering closely with Unilever UK, P&G US, Google US and UK, and Microsoft UK. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do to fully bring this tool to market, but we're excited that this new buying method will empower advertisers to efficiently share their stories on our platform.", "One of the products I\u2019m most excited about is Snap Pro for Business and Creators. This product will be made for public entities, from public figures to local businesses to charitable causes, that want to use our platform to organically reach an audience beyond friends and family. With Snap Pro, it will be easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us. We\u2019re still extremely early in our roll-out plan and just recently onboarded a select group of brands and creators.", "For our third area of focus, we remain strongly committed to proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ROI is the best incentive that we can offer our advertisers, and we have been working tirelessly to show it across multiple products and verticals.", "This quarter, we made great progress scaling adoption and usage of Snap Pixel. We nearly tripled the number of advertisers using the pixel quarter-over-quarter. We\u2019re seeing that this capability drives strong results, primarily for our SMB and commerce advertisers.", "One great example is the Ridge, a wallet brand that used Snap Pixel to create both custom and lookalike audiences based on people who made a purchase on their eCommerce site. This strategy delivered. They drove a 4.1 times Return on Ad Spend. It also delivered a 55% decrease in Cost per Action, or CPA, allowing the company to achieve an overall CPA that was more than 20% lower than on other ad platforms.", "We are excited for the future of Snap Pixel as we continue investing in improvements such as the ability to optimize delivery based on lower-funnel events.", "We also understand how important it is for advertisers to measure impact across platforms. From television to social platforms, we want to demonstrate that advertising on Snapchat increases value to an advertiser\u2019s overall strategy. We recently collaborated with Nielsen, using their Total Ad Ratings, which allow advertisers to measure the incremental reach of their Snapchat campaigns relative to TV campaigns. Despite being outspent 25:1 by television, Snapchat campaigns were able to deliver 8% incremental reach on top of TV campaigns for the same set of brands.", "Finally, we are continuing to work with our third-party ecosystem to demonstrate ROI for all verticals. We conducted a series of custom marketing mix model studies with Nielsen to measure the effectiveness of Snapchat advertising within the beer category. The studies showed that Snapchat was more efficient than both traditional channels and other forms of digital media. Snap Ads outperformed the category media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.7 times, while Lenses and Filters outperformed the media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.3 times.", "Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and I\u2019m optimistic about the future of our business.", "Thank you for your time. I will now hand it off to Drew for a financial update.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. In the quarter, we made continued progress against our three financial goals: first, grow users and sales; second, leverage our cost structure; and third, soundly manage cash. As Imran mentioned, sales grew meaningfully year-over-year. Equally important, sales growth continues to well outpace our cost growth year-over-year.", "Over the past few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to make the right long-term decisions for our business. One of our core financial strategies was to invest early ahead of the sales curve to build the right cost structure that we could both scale with our growth and leverage over time.", "In the first quarter, we successfully leveraged our cost structure. Year-over-year sales growth was over 1.5 times our cost growth, and sequential costs were up only 1% in the quarter. On a per-user basis, ARPU increased 34% year-over-year, twice as fast as our CoRPU growth. Cost of revenue grew modestly, and operating expenses were sequentially down for the second time in three quarters, excluding restructuring charges.", "An efficient cost structure is a central part of our financial roadmap. We will continue to invest in strategic areas like innovation, new products, and people to fuel future growth. That said, we believe many of these opportunities can be funded by running our business more effectively, in areas like the back of house and hosting infrastructure. As we continue to successfully manage our cost structure, it should continue to yield two key benefits. First, we see strong incremental flow-through on revenue growth. And second, we can continue to moderate our cash burn, which we did again in Q1, as cash burn was less than half the rate from a few quarters ago.", "Let me now expand on the results for the quarter. First, global revenues were 231 million in the first quarter, and we saw growth in every region. International markets now represent 26% of our total revenue, up from 14% a year ago and 23% in Q4. Consistent with prior quarters, the fastest growing product in Q1 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold programmatically. Strength in Snap Ads more than offset softness in Creative Tools sales, which were down in the quarter.", "As expected, auction revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing. Let me share some numbers with you. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, were up over 450% year-over-year and over 15% sequentially. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Story Ads, was down nearly 65% year-over-year and nearly 20% sequentially. Third, we ended the quarter with 95% of our Snaps Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, served programmatically, up from 90% in the prior quarter.", "In the quarter, we added many new programs to the Discover page. In February, we partnered with NBC to bring the Winter Olympics to Snapchat users. We offered a series of creative ad products and packages to our advertisers, which drove incremental revenues for the business. Financially, the Olympics were a nice revenue boost, but comprised less than 10% of total revenues for the quarter.", "Now, let me talk about expenses. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures, including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Cost of revenue expenses grew $7 million in the quarter, driven by three factors. First, higher revenue share on Olympic content; second, incremental infrastructure costs related to the launch of the app redesign; and third, the addition of 4.2 million new DAUs. Hosting costs per user increased from $0.70 in Q4 to $0.73 in Q1, but hosting cost increases moderated during the quarter as our engineering team continued to optimize new code to reduce infrastructure expenses.", "On operating expenses, the primary driver remains people cost. Over the last few years, we have consistently invested to build an organization with the scale to compete. We hired over 2,400 people in the last two years and we\u2019re now digesting that rapid growth in an evolving world. As a result, during Q1 we had a 7% reduction in force, in order to better align resources around our top strategic priorities and reflect structural changes in our business.", "Consistent with earlier disclosures, the company recorded a charge of $9.9 million in the first quarter, but those charges have been adjusted out of EBITDA. We expect to realize $7 million to $8 million in ongoing savings per quarter. In the first quarter, OpEx costs were $257 million, down 1% sequentially, and overall headcount declined 3% for the period.", "Let me briefly touch on our capital-deployment priorities, which remain reinvesting in strategic areas of our business like product, content, AR, automation, and international expansion as well as opportunistic M&A. Q1 CapEx remained modest at $36 million and we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. As of March 31, 2018, total shares outstanding were 1.254 billion and 1.457 billion on a fully diluted basis.", "Let me now share some near-term observations on our business. First, as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels, with growth in auction impressions, partially offset by pricing for both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. We are planning for infrastructure costs to increase modestly in the short-term as we continue to test and rollout further changes to the application, partially offset by hosting cost efficiency programs. Revenue share expenses should moderate without Olympic content.", "We continue to plan for modest operating expense growth in the near term. Consistent with last quarter, we are planning for the first half of 2018 to grow by low double-digits versus the back half of 2017, excluding one-time charges. Please note operating expenses exclude cost of revenue, stock-based compensation, and our move to Santa Monica.", "Consistent with prior disclosures on the Venice exit, we expect to incur $25 million to $45 million in charges throughout 2018, primarily in the second and third quarters, to reflect the exit cost of these Venice buildings. The majority of these charges are cash payments due on remaining lease terms. We are planning for CapEx to be slightly elevated in the near term, as we continue our buildout of leased Santa Monica facilities and execute our move throughout 2018.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q1 expense was $143.2 million. Please note that this number included a one-time benefit of $32 million, as a result of the reduction in force plan we implemented during the quarter. We believe that the stock-based compensation rate in the second half of 2017 is a good proxy for the short-term. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Two questions, guys. One for Evan and then one for Drew. Evan, on the DAUs, it seems like anytime you guys are making changes to the Android app, you're running into some performance issues and DAUs tend to drop off. So I guess what gives you the confidence as you ship this new Android code in the second half of this year that we'll see a stabilization and when do you expect Android to use to start kind of consistently picking up.", "And then Drew, you mentioned the 2Q revenue growth will be substantially lower, so would that just be Olympics impact coming out or can you talk a little bit more specifically about the deceleration in ad revenue versus the 61% in the first quarter. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi, Ross. We should have made a lot of changes faster in our engineering organization and really put Android first. Now, and I'm starting -- last year, we started re-architecting the entire application and rebuilding it from scratch and we now have a bunch of those components and we're testing some already in the application, but ultimately it\u2019s the re-architecture that will make a big difference and I think beyond just the performance improvements that we're going to see, it will also enable our entire team to move a lot faster as we build new features. Right now, if we build a new feature, the codebase is so complex, we tend to break other things and I think reducing the complexity through modularization will make a huge difference in our ability to execute quickly on the product roadmap.", "Drew Vollero", "So Ross, as it relates to the second quarter, we were really focused on the strategic activities in business, not necessarily the near term financial targets. We're really focused on improving the redesign, improving Android, driving users to platform, driving our advertiser ROI. If you look at the platform itself at the product level, we have strength in Span Ads that direct response business is doing quite well internationally, has been a growing force as well. But look, at the end of the day, we are transitioning right now to the creative tool business Imran talked about in his opening remarks and we really are focused on being the value leader in the advertising platform and so what we're not doing is playing the pricing game to maximize short term revenues. We're really more focused on bringing advertisers to the platform and making sure advertisers have solid ROIs. There was a modest boost in the quarter as you mentioned, to Olympic revenue, which we don't expect to continue in Q2, but that's not a big piece of the story here.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mark Mahaney", "In the past, I think you've talked about crash levels on the Android app, any sort of update there as to how they're trending? And then you talked about this disruption to users. What have you seen in the quarter so far in terms of those disruptions to users, any impact on engagement? Does it seem to you like you're back to normal with your users\u2019 use of the app? Is there still a lot of experimentation just how would you address the volatility of the overall user base in response to the redesigns?", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. No specific updates on the crash levels. I do want to talk about one of the big changes that we're making to Snap, which I think will make a big difference. When we redesign the application, we combine the stories and chats from your friends onto the same page. And we like having all the stuff from your friends in one place, because it was a lot easier to find, but we didn't realize how hard it would be to optimize for those two different behaviors, talking with friends and watching their stories and it turns out it's really hard to optimize for both at the same time. So one of the biggest changes that we're making is moving stories from your friends over to the Discover page and putting it at the top of the page. So they'll still be separate from all the other content on our service, but that way your friends come first, no matter where you are in the application, but we can still optimize for watching content on one side of service and communicating with friends on the other. So that's a big change coming and we think it will make a difference.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "Great. Two things. I think in your prepared remarks, you said users were stabilizing in April, maybe you could revisit that a little bit? And then Imran, how much of the 2Q deceleration is related to the redesign and how are you thinking, you mentioned you expected a big back half, how would you think about an improvement in the back half on advertising?", "Imran Khan", "Yes. Hi. So let's take the second question first. So I think one of the things that we have done, we listen to our advertisers very closely and what are the products that they want and I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about how we will have launched reach and frequency with two advertisers. We also launching SNAP Pro, which will let people to create content and then ultimately promote those content. We are also launching lower funnel optimization for our performance advertising products. All of those things, I think, will significantly help our advertisers to take leverage of our platform. And then on top of that, what we're doing in terms of on ad ranking side by improving swipe rate and showing the right ad to the right users. And as our mission gets better and better, I think there's a lot of opportunities on that. So I'm really optimistic that I think we're doing the right thing and building the right thing.", "In terms of Evan\u2019s comment on, I think we said we are seeing early sign of stabilization on iOS.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Evan, I think at the time of the IPO one of the concerns was the need for your ad ops teams to essentially vet the creative, so that if fits in with the surrounding content and does not work against a consumer experience, but now that you are going more self-service, you have certain instances, which I guess result in the negative market creative, you touched on earlier. So it seems like there's a need to police the add creators as well, so is there a technology base or some other type of solution that can look for that type of ad content to take down? And Imran, a question on the story is the need to reformat the ad content to vertical presentations still a headwind for you? And if so, what are you doing to help advertisers either from a technology or proper perspective?", "Evan Spiegel", "Stephen. Yeah, we have a lot of empathy for the ad reviewers who work on our business. It's a tough job. We really consider them digital first responders in a sense and so we're definitely building out a lot of programs to try and help them do their jobs more effectively and we always feel terrible when mistakes are made, but we're making progress there and really we want to do our best to support the team and doing their job.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to story ad, I think what we're seeing that market is more and more embracing our format. I think 3.5 years ago, when you started the ad business, I think this full screen vertical video was very foreign to many advertisers and we heard a lot of pushback, but I think over the years, we have seen that advertisers are seeing the value of the full screen ad and the storytelling ad and we're seeing that other advertisers, other publishers also embracing these formats. So I think it is -- the headwind is getting better and I think we're also building a lot of creatives and I think one of our mission is creating friction less application experience and I think we're making a lot of progress there and we continue to invest on that technology.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "We\u2019ve seen some of the changes that you're talking about in terms of separating out stories and from Snaps and sort of the next evolution of this redesign, realize, it's extremely early, but any sort of indication in terms of how users are reacting to that. I know you're not going to go into specific metrics, but just even qualitatively what you're hearing from them? And then to the extent that we're sort of seeing pricing fluctuation, the way we are in the early innings of your moves into the programmatic, any sense sort of where pricing on any sort of like for like basis is shaking out between where Snap and other major digital platforms would be? I know it's not always easy to compare apples and oranges, but whether it's a ROI metric or price per engagement, would be curious in any benchmarking you might be able to share insight into.", "Evan Spiegel", "When we build products, we\u2019re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away, we're thinking a lot about how our products that we've built will help us accomplish our mission. So, we build things that we believe that will help us empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And so I think it's really important to understand that people think about self-expression on Snapchat in different ways. So some people would rather create content with just a small audience of their friends and other people want to create content if they have a much bigger audience because they want to reach more people. ", "And so our job is to make Snap work well for all different types of people so that we can empower people to express themselves. And with the redesign in particular, we try to make Snapchat feel more personal for people who want to use it exclusively with their friends and also more valuable for people who want to use at large audience, because we want to do both really well. So we believe the redesign brings us closer to accomplishing our mission. And we're continuing to iterate very quickly on the things that we don't like.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to pricing, we are really focused on driving advertisers ROI and bringing more and more advertisers on our platform, because when you have a lot more users, we have more choices to show to the right users. And I think we're also a new platform, so we want advertisers to learn our platform and how to win on our platform. And so fundamentally, we're not really focused on pricing right now, we are really more focused on bringing more advertisers on the platform and helping them understand our platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "I think you mentioned earlier that pricing is down 65% year-on-year and then when talking about the substantial de-sell [ph] in Q2, I think you noted that pricing is a primary driver there. I guess the question is where are we in that adjustment period and at what point do you expect that pricing will begin to stabilize? And then in terms of the redesign we\u2019re putting friends\u2019 stories above discover content, what impact do you think that that will have on engagement with commercial content and ultimately with some of the ad revenues that flow through that part of the channel.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to pricing, the 65% decline year-over-year really represents the change in selling method, we used to have a direct sales force that sold of the ads top of funnel. Now, we\u2019ve gone to programmatic, and so that's really led to the year-over-year decline. I'll echo Imran\u2019s sentiments, right now, the key activities that we're focused on are really bringing advertisers to the platform. We need a broader base of advertisers using our product and then see if really we're very focused on ROI. We do think that will be the number one metric for us in the long term success. So that's what we're focused on far more than sort of where pricing bottoms out. We don't have the near term plan for that.", "Evan Spiegel", "In terms of the Discover product, we believe that making Snapchat is the best place to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. We will build a larger audience for creators and ultimately benefit them and we\u2019re also introducing a lot of new tools this year for creators, which we believe will inspire them to continue creating great content for Snap. So ultimately, we're taking a long view here and we believe that as users experience our products, we will be able to build our audience and that will benefit creators.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Two if I can. First Imran, I think you said March average DAU is lower than 1Q average, but still up in the 4Q average, which seems to imply that maybe March ended lower than where you were in December kind of on a period end basis. Can you kind of talk about if April is down from March and then do you think the early results from moving friends\u2019 stories back to the right side of the camera does suggest that allowing help stabilize DAU?", "And then secondly, can you give us a sense for what percent of ad revenue now is coming from performance advertisers and maybe a sense of how the more sophisticated performance advertisers who have adopted the best most sophisticated tools, how they\u2019re scaling budgets plus those adoption rates. Can you maybe give us an update on the percent of at Ad Age 100 that are still spending if you will from the kind of 1Q \u201916 period, so can you give us that would be great.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I'll take from the like last question first. Look. I think we're seeing great success with a lot of the large advertisers. We strengthen our relationship with several brands like take McDonald's as an excellent example, they have pushed a multiproduct approach for nearly every campaign, always looking to test, optimize and learn with us. In fact, they were one of the first advertisers to test audience filters in action, creating seven different filters and targeting each one to a niche audience. ", "But most importantly, over the years, Snapchat has gone from being a platform that McDonald's would leverage periodically to an always on long term partners. Year over year, McDonald's grew their investment triple digit with us. So we're really pleased, we had a lot of success stories like that. We're becoming true business partner for a lot of large advertisers but at the same time we're seeing healthy growth in our performance advertising campaign. And I think we\u2019ve got great feedback from them and based on that, we're trying to bring creative tools also to the DR customers and that business is going at a very healthy rate and we're very, very excited about it.", "With regards to DAU, I think we gave you the average for the quarter was 191 million. Q4 average was 187. I believe what Evan talked about in his prepared remarks that March was lower than our Q1 average of 191, but higher than the Q4 average of 187. So that should give you a pretty good guidance where that numbers were in March.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.", "Jason Helfstein", "I wanted to dig a bit more. So for all the examples of McDonald's of triple digits, I guess how much of the weakness or relative to what we're all expecting was from advertisers who pulled back because of call it misunderstanding or questions or publicity and so the point is like what did it take to get those advertisers back. And is that -- the point being you expect those advertisers to be back in the third quarter, just go a little bit deeper into that, what caused the advertisers toward spending to pull back and what makes you -- and what gives you confidence they come back.", "Imran Khan", "Look, I think -- thanks for asking the question. At the end of the day, advertisers are rational. They want to advertise and they want to drive return on their ad spend. But at the same time, they're human. When there's a lot of negative news on the press every day, it does give people pause, it does influence people buying decisions, know it's very hard to handicap how what percentage, but that does come out on the conversation and become a disruption on the selling process. But I think the way to win is by proving otherwise, right. The examples like McDonald's or some of the examples that I shared on the call, when we go and prove that, but I just had the money that this spent and we drive value for them. ", "It's really, really important. I think one of the things that is really important to understand that the Snapchat\u2019s position in the millennial audience, right, there are over 90 million millennials in the US today and they represent the single largest generation ever defined. Millennials are expected to become a huge economic force in the coming years that already dominating lot of buying decisions. And we have a very strong position in that demographic and some of the investment that our product team and engineering team did to swing the right ad to the right audience. I think that we -- and we just need to prove those ROIs and educate the market and that's ultimately drive value for everybody.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge ", "So ad impressive growth has been significant the past several quarters, just wondering how you feel about ad loads and ability to raise ad loads and then just any update on engagement. I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it, time spent on the platform, anything there would be helpful?", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think again -- I think about the problem is ad is a piece of content and when it's a piece of content, you have to show the most relevant content to the most relevant person and that really drives the engagement, right. If I show you one content that you don't care about it, if I show you one piece of content, you will be annoyed. If I show you three great pieces of content that you really, really like and you want to engage with it, that you will like it. So I think rather than thinking about the ad load, what we have been challenging our product team and our engineering team, are we doing the best job showing the most relevant content to our users. When you do that, everybody wins. And I think one of the thing I talked about in the call that how we saw 8 percentage point increase in swipe rate. And I think that's really, really exciting and that's something I think there's a lot more work to be done and we continue to push out teams to do that. ", "In terms of time spent, I think Evan mentioned in the call that more than over 30 minutes people are due to spend on our platform, over 30 minutes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Just first you talk about self-serve helping increase the advertiser number 20x over the past year. Just curious if you\u2019ve quantified that number? And then, Imran, can you just talk more about the concept, the moving to always on spending and how much that's actually happening across the platforms at this point? And then just quickly, do you think you're seeing any impact in users from competitive entertainment like Fortnite and PUBG?", "Imran Khan", "So with regards to -- look I think in terms of number of advertisers, we launch our self-serve platform in Q2 of last year. So it's a very new platform. So we have a lot of room to grow our number of advertisers on our platform, and I think so we have a lot of work to do and we're very pleased with the growth, but we want to grow faster and there's a lot of room to grow.", "With regards to competitive pressure from other games like Fortnite, my son who is 8 years old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend, but I think it's really hard for me to sit here and predict how that's spending impacting time on our platform at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two. The first one, appreciate the color on the Snap ad versus the creative tools, the lender\u2019s growth in the quarter. Wondering, could you talk us through how we should think about the growth trajectory of those two businesses over the course of the year, maybe the relative size and just to think about the puts and takes on revenue growth between those two buckets this year?", "And the second one, you talked a lot about a focus to bring more advertisers on to the platform. Maybe talk through philosophically how has your advertiser onboarding process changed between large advertisers and SMBs. What are the keys to success going forward?", "Drew Vollero", "Good. As it relates to the product mix, we never really quantify the difference between the Snap ads and the creative tools. We gave some sense maybe a couple of years ago about the size of a business we described in a sort of a good one two combination and both very meaningful to our business. I would say with the move to programmatic over the last six to twelve months, the Snap Ads business has become a much bigger piece of our business than the creative tools. And so the Snap Ads business continues to grow. We have good traction internationally. We have good traction on the DR side of the world. So we are definitely seeing that being the engine that\u2019s fueling our growth right now. I think the creative business will continue \u2013 the creative tool business will continue to transition that as we commented on in the second quarter here, those are -- that's what we're seeing in the near term. So right now, the bulk of the revenue is being driven by the Snap ads business and that's really the engine that's going to fuel our growth in the near term.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think to add on Drew\u2019s color, I think our creative tool business also have a lot of opportunities like more recently we launched Lens Studios for example. It really democratize who can create lenses. I think one of the big challenge for a lot of the small businesses to create creative tools is that they have to work with us directly, but as the Lens Studios and those things proliferated, they have the opportunities for a lot of advertisers to embrace this creative tools business, that's also opened up new revenue opportunity for us. So I think we feel very excited about that, how we are monetizing camera and at the same time, we\u2019re monetizing content on our platform and how there are a lot more opportunities to do that. ", "With regards to your second question, how you\u2019re addressing the market, we break up ourselves in two different groups. One is DSO, direct sales organization who focus on the large advertisers and they are really a sales consultant for those. The second bucket is our global online sales team, so that has combination of inside sales and our channel partners. So we partner with other channels who actually sell on behalf of us as well. So that's how we were trying to cover across the market and educate them about the platform and to help onboard more and more advertisers on the platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Rich Greenfield", "Hi. A few questions. First just housekeeping. I wanted to follow up on the question before regarding Evan's commentary on DAUs If you look at kind of March 2018 quarter end, should we infer basically, is the inference essentially that March quarter end for \u201918 was actually below December 2017 quarter end? And then two, on product, Evan, you mentioned shifting friends\u2019 content over to the right, which I certainly understand, but part of the new right side redesign not only was it algorithmic, but it was also kind of everything. ", "So it was like one solid flowing experience where it almost felt like you got lost and you were just clicking, you have this kind of infinite array of content. Now, as you start to separate out friends from everything else, discover, kind of brand/implementers, how does that impact time spent in the discover/influencer content on the right side relative to friends? And then just a part of that, could that actually cause a disruption as you kind of shift the stories back to the right, are we looking at another potential disruption in user behavior, as people get used to that type of a change back. That would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So overall, as we look at the redesign, the thing that we're most excited about is creating this infinite scroll content. As you mentioned, in the past, the right side of the application really only had your friends\u2019 stories and a very small select group of publishers without a lot of personalization. And so I think one of the really great things that we've been able to accomplish with the redesign is putting your friends at the top, making them most important, but also still opening up into this world of personalized content below. So I think, we're going to get the best of both worlds in that sense and still create an environment where people feel empowered to express themselves.", "And I don't think we can give you any specifics on the earlier DAU question, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore.", "Anthony DiClemente", "I just wanted to follow up on that question about content. In terms of \u2013 it just sounds based on what you\u2019ve said Evan that there could be a transition and emphasis to user generated content, given the changes in the Discover tab and I guess if not, maybe just what is your forward strategy with respect to licensed professional content from here?", "And then a question for Drew, you stated in your prepared remarks that future acquisitions will likely be additive to stock-based compensation. So I'm curious what areas is Snap actively pursuing in terms of M&A and how do you think about balancing the potential M&A with your priorities around cash management from here?", "Drew Vollero", "Let me take the second one first and then I'll turn it over to Evan. Look, we've had a lot of success managing our cash burn rate over the last couple of quarters. We've reduced it by over 50%. How we've done that is we\u2019ve really focused the strategic capital deployment priorities here at the company. We're really focused on investing in our business. The M&A here will be very opportunistic. If we see the right thing at the right time at the right price, we\u2019ll go ahead and make that happen, but right now, we're focused on really the key strategic activities of growing our business around the design, around the Android, new advertisers\u2019 ROI, those are the strategic priorities in the business. If we have a chance to be opportunistic, with an acquisition, we will go ahead and do that. Historically, the acquisitions have been pretty tuck-in in nature. They've been focused more on technologies and talent than they have been sort of robust acquisitions, big companies, big business models, et cetera. So that's where we've been focused to date. And I'd look for again our strategic priorities for cash really to be the investment in the business.", "Evan Spiegel", "Ultimately, users\u2019 content has obviously been a strong suit for us for a very long time, because we're so focused on powering creativity, opening to the camera and building all these creative tools that inspire people to create. I think as we look at the redesign and the opportunity for publishers and creators, we're definitely excited about the progress we\u2019ll be able to make for both last year, we delivered $100 million in revenue to our partners and we're excited to build on that. So I think publishers will play a very important role in the future and also create more opportunities for creators and influencers to be successful on Snap.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust.", "Youssef Squali", "Two quick questions for me. First, maybe Evan, you referenced changes in market narrative as a reason for the softness. Just trying to understand kind of the other side of that is for the market narrative to change again, I'm assuming this is on the advertiser side, there is really no control necessarily in terms of timing. So you talked about how Q3 is going to be an inflection point for that, just trying to get a sense of, if advertisers have now, so to speak, put you guys in the penalty box, what kind of gives you the confidence that you can get out of it within a quarter? ", "And then on the profitability side, there were some news reports talking about how maybe you gave directives internally to accelerate dramatically accelerate the profitability of the business. First, is there any truth to that? And second, how do you look at and maybe this is a question for Drew partly as well, balance out the profitability versus the doubling down of the investments as you suggest in your prepared remarks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So in terms of profitability, obviously, building a sustainable business is what's going to allow us to pursue our mission for a really long time. So it's something we think about and I think we've made great progress over the last few years towards being able to fund our own growth. I think if we look at the big transition we made last year to our programmatic advertising business, I think the really great benefit of that is we've gotten a lot better at showing advertisers ROI, so the market narrative I think will matter less over time, as we continue to improve our measurement capabilities and to really deliver that for advertisers. So excited about the progress that we're making there. And you're right that it's important to focus on the performance business.", "Drew Vollero", "So, I will -- just to build on Evan's comments, I mean, it makes sense for us to build toward a breakeven. It's a logical next step for our business, but let's be clear, we really don't manage against that. There is no timeline to take that of the certain date. The key thing to remember is that, that's going to for us begin with growth. We need to continue to grow our user base. We need to grow our revenues. We\u2019re going to keep investing in areas like product innovation, AR and content to name a few. That said, Snap for breakeven also is going to revolve around carrying water in both shoulders for us, you have to be sensible about our cost structure. We have a moderate cost growth where it makes sense. We have a large infrastructure for a company our size. We\u2019re built for growth and you saw that in Q1 that we were able to leverage the cost structure, our cost growth was only up 1% sequentially. So there are opportunities for us to do things better and that should allow us to continue to make investments that will fuel our growth.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today's session and you may now disconnect."]}

[Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ms. Sam Stewart, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Sam Stewart", "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Snap Inc.'s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagements and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2017 which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement.

During the first quarter, we focused our efforts primarily on the performance and quality of our Snapchat application and automation across our content products and advertising business. We're pleased with the early results from these performance and quality improvements, particularly on Android devices. These improvements helped drive a significant increase in engagement, with now over 3 billion Snaps created every day with our cameras, generating an increase in overall sessions and time spent.", "We were also able to more than double the number of net additional users coming from Android devices compared to last quarter. And Android users accounted for over 30% of net additional users this quarter, up from 20% last quarter. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're excited by the amount of progress we've made in such a short time.", "We averaged 166 million daily active users for the quarter. Worldwide net additional users in Q1 increased by 54% compared to Q4 as we continued to expand our community in North America and Europe. We also managed to make some headway in the rest of world, largely due to improvements on Android.", "Towards the end of the first quarter, we began to roll out our search product. Search is exciting for us because it begins to expose the so-called long tail of content on our service. With so many Snaps created every day, there really is a story for everything on Snapchat. Search surfaces interesting Stories created by machine learning and allows our community to find Stories for anything they might be interested in.", "We made significant progress in automating our advertising business this quarter, with more than 20% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically through our API. Automating our ads platform means that advertisers get better pricing, our community sees better ads and we're able to make more money per impression.", "Overall, I feel we have executed well on our priorities for this quarter, performance, quality and automation. Our progress this quarter should provide a strong foundation as we continue to build our business.", "With that, I will turn it over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We're very pleased with our Q1 achievements. We're really excited about the progress we have made increasing engagement across Snapchat. We believe that great advertising starts with strong user engagement. As Evan mentioned, time spent for our users continues to grow. On average, in Q1 our users spent over 30 minutes per day on Snapchat. This increase is largely because of the unique content on our platform.", "Snapchat offers exclusive content from several perspectives, friends and family, our global community and premium publishers. With user Stories, Snapchatters see the world through the eyes of their friends and family. Our community creates and sends billions of Snaps every day as a fun and easy way to communicate and stay up to date with their closest friends.", "With our Stories, Snapchatters stay informed and connected to the world around them. This past quarter, we told over 450 Our Stories in over eight languages to our global community. Our expert teams curate Snaps submitted by Snapchatters around the world's biggest moments, such as breaking news, entertainment and sports.", "In February, Our Story coverage of the Oscars received over 250,000 submissions from Snapchatters. This allowed us to curate multi-perspective stories full of unique content that is exclusive to our platform. Over 21 million global unique viewers tuned in to watch our Oscars coverage, indicating to us that the power of these stories is resonating with our community.", "With publisher's Stories, Snapchatters engage with premium content curated by some of the most credible media companies in the world. We expanded our offerings in Q1 by launching nine new partners in the U.S. and one in Norway. This brings us to a total of 55 global partners as of Q1 2017.", "We work with Nielsen on custom analysis on Snapchat's unique daily reach in the U.S., when Nielsen found that 45% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are reached by Snapchat on any given day. This is nine times more than the average daily reach of the top 15 TV networks and nearly 5 times more than the top TV network.", "Additionally, 87% of our U.S. daily active users between the ages of 18 and 34 cannot be reached by any top 15 TV network. Our platform allows us to engage an audience that research shows is difficult to reach. We believe that the ability to deliver this type of reach and engagement is the cornerstone of a great advertising business.", "Now I would like to share some of the progress we have made to benefit advertisers in three key areas, one, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and, three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. We started our advertising business by servicing big brands. This strategy proved invaluable. These partners have high standards and provided great feedback that shaped our priorities. Universal Pictures was our first advertiser in the fall of 2014. Since then, they have challenged us to find unique and effective ways to reach the right audience for each campaign. We have been a go-to partner for nearly every single title, helping them across a variety of objectives. From 2015 to 2016, Universal more than doubled their spend with us which we feel is a testament to the returns they have seen on their early investment.", "And we continue to listen and develop new solutions to serve our advertisers. By listening to our partners, we learned that advertisers are hungry for more effective direct response advertising solutions. This meant enhancing our Snap Ad brand's experience with interactive capabilities which we call Snap Ads with Attachments. Attachments help advertisers accomplish specific goals by providing a way for users to engage with a Snap Ad.", "For example, a user who watches a Snap Ad for a new Hollywood movie can swipe up to view the full trailer or buy a ticket, all without leaving Snapchat. I would like to share a couple of examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments are driving value for our performance advertisers.", "Acorns, a micro investing app, partnered with us on an app install campaign to drive both brand awareness and app installs. With this campaign we delivered a 300% increase in app installs. Fullscreen also continues to partner with us on various direct response initiatives. They consistently see higher active viewing rates from users who come in via Snap Ads compared to other platforms. And each time we collaborate together, they continue to see lower costs per acquisition.", "We have designed our ad products to work well on their own or when used together in integrated campaigns. We have many advertisers that now leverage Snapchat with an always-on strategy.", "Throughout Q1, Snapchat was a strategic mobile partner to Anheuser-Busch's core brands, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra and Busch. Anheuser-Busch leveraged Snapchat as an always-on video partner, utilizing all of our ad products for a variety of initiatives. This included sports partnership like NFL, MLB and NASCAR, as well as holidays and tent-poles, like St. Patrick's Day.", "L'Oreal U.S.A is another great example. They have made us an always-on part of their strategy, augmenting Lens and Geofilter executions with Snap Ads. L'Oreal U.S.A has taken advantage of Snapchat's premium, contextually relevant publisher content in combination with advanced targeting in user Stories, to keep their brands top of mind with customers.", "The second area we have focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We want to make it easy and painless for both the largest brands and the smallest local businesses to advertise on Snapchat. This includes how advertisers buy, create and manage their ads. We're still in the early stages of building these tools and we're making good progress.", "In Q1 2016, we launched our on-demand Geofilters tool or ODG. To date we have tens of thousands of advertisers creating and managing their own geofiltered campaigns. This past quarter, we launched line of credit for ODG to make it even easier for all advertisers to buy ads.", "Our most significant step was with the launch of our API and auction in Q4 of last year. We have been working hard to scale our auction to make it something valuable to advertisers of all sizes. Today, our API is live in 24 countries and serving some of the world's largest brands in addition to small and medium-sized businesses.", "Last week we announced our first Snap Ads self-service product, called Snapchat Ad Manager. Our goal is to put the power of our ad products into the hands of every advertiser, regardless of their size. This tool supports all of our ad products, targeting capabilities; and goal-based auction solutions which allows advertisers to bid for swipes or bid for app installs.", "The third area of focus is proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Delivering metrics and proving ROI to advertisers has been a massive area of progress over the past 12 months. Today we have 13 different third-party measurement partners and this list will continue to grow. We also invested heavily in Snap to Store, our own first-of-its-kind measurement offering. Snap to Store allows advertisers to measure foot traffic and demographics for Snapchatters after they see ads on our platform. These kind of location-based online to off-line measurement is a strength for Snapchat and in many ways a Holy Grail of ad measurement.", "During the 2016 holiday season, Hollister ran a Snap Ads campaign. And within seven days of seeing the ad, Snap to Store found that over 63,000 incremental Snapchatters visited a Hollister store nationally.", "Overall, we're excited about the progress we have made as we scale our advertising business. We have a lot of work to do in the rest of 2017 and look for -- to what's ahead.", "Thanks, everyone, for the time. And now I will hand it over to Drew.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Growth in new users, engagement and year-over-year revenues highlighted our first quarter results. Revenues grew 286% year-over-year to $149.6 million, driven primarily by strong advertiser demand. Revenues in North America were $128.7 million in the first quarter, up 259% year-over-year. In Europe, revenues were $13.1 million, up 385% year-over-year. Rest of world revenues were $7.8 million, up from only a couple hundred thousand dollars, a year ago.", "Sequentially, first quarter revenues were down 10% compared to Q4 2016. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the expected seasonality from advertising which comprises the bulk of our revenues.", "Snap sold revenue was $129 million, approximately 86% of total revenues. Partner sold revenue was $12.3 million and other revenues were $8.3 million, primarily driven by Spectacles. Total revenues outside North America for Q1 were 14% of sales, up from 7% of sales, a year ago. Average revenue per user or ARPU, was $0.90 in the first quarter, up from $0.32 a year ago but sequentially lower than Q4.", "We believe North America remains a leading indicator for the scale potential of our business. North American ARPU was $1.81, more than double our global average which was up 170% versus last year. Both Snap Ads and Creative Tools were meaningful revenue drivers for the business. New products like the API were also key revenue drivers in Q1.", "Now turning to expenses, we have two primary cost components, cost of revenue and operating expenses. Please note that when I discuss these expense figures, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of hosting costs and revenue share expenses. Operating expenses are driven by headcount costs. We utilize third parties to provide our infrastructure. This strategy has allowed us to focus on product innovation while we leverage their expertise, their capital and their operating efficiencies. We estimate this capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures to date, while delivering competitive daily costs to serve our users.", "In the quarter, we made good progress against our hosting costs in two key areas. First, we started to migrate to a dual cloud environment using both Google and Amazon to host our infrastructure. And second, we signed new contracts with each provider which lowered costs for most of our key services. As such, hosting expenses fell 12% in the quarter sequentially, down from $113 million to $99 million. These savings more than offset the increases we incurred from growing engagement.", "Relatedly, total cost of revenue fell sequentially $10.3 million or 6%, driven by those hosting savings, partially offset by revenue share expenses which grew slightly. Revenue share expenses increased by shifting the structure of certain revenue share contracts from variable to fixed fee arrangements which raised costs in the quarter but could create leverage as the year progresses and as revenues expand.", "As mentioned, cost of revenue is closely linked to our capital expenditures. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $18 million and were primarily spent on the expansion of our global office footprint. Capital expenditures were $20.4 million in Q4 2016, so Q1 expenses were down 12% sequentially.", "Operating expenses increased 18% sequentially to $196.2 million in the first quarter. We continue to invest in acquiring engineering talent and scaling our global operations. Expenses related to headcount were over 75% of total operating expenses in the quarter. We ended the quarter with 2,360 employees, up from 1,859 at the end of 2016.", "Our financial strategies for operating expenses are threefold, first, to continue to invest in engineering and sales; second, to leverage G&A expenses; and, third, to moderate overall cost growth per head. In the quarter, we made progress against all three goals. 90% of our new hires were in engineering and sales. Additionally, G&A expenses fell from 39% to 32% of total operating expenses. And third, operating expenses per head declined 7% sequentially. Our overall business remains in investment mode.", "Scale operations related to recruiting and facilities are incurred upfront while monetization occurs more gradually. As such, nominal losses increased in the quarter.", "GAAP net loss was $2.2 billion for the quarter which included the expected stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $2 billion as a result of our IPO. Stock-based compensation expense was significantly higher than prior periods due to two factors. First, the recognition of expenses related to RSUs for which the performance condition was triggered by the completion of our IPO in March. And second, an award granted to our CEO which we expensed in its entirety during the quarter.", "Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2017 RSUs at the end of Q1 is $1.3 billion, expected to be recognized over a period of slightly more than three years, of which about half of that expense we expect to recognize during the remainder of 2017. RSUs granted during 2017 will be an additional expense.", "Adjusted EBITDA loss was $188.2 million in Q1 2017, compared to a loss of $152.3 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $93.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total shares outstanding at the end of Q1 was 1,179 million and 1,432 million on a fully diluted basis.", "We remain in a strong cash position. Cash and marketable securities increased sequentially from $987.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily from the proceeds of our IPO in early March. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Product innovation and execution remain top priorities for 2017.", "I'll now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.", "Mark Mahaney", "Two sets of questions. Drew, would you care to comment at all about how to think about DAU growth near term through the balance of the year? And any commentary on when we could see peak EBITDA losses?", "And then, Evan, if you think about the product roadmap, are there particular areas you think that we as investors should focus on? I know you mentioned a couple of improvements you made to the Android platform. Other -- on the Apple side, are there particular new features that have been rolled out recently or are about to be rolled out that you think could be meaningful in terms of user and engagement growth? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. I'd love to speak a little bit to the DAU question, because it's a question that we get all the time. And I think one of the reasons why it's such a popular question is because there's a lot of this thing in our industry called growth hacking, where you send a lot of push notifications to users or you try to get them to do things that might be unnatural or something like that.", "And I think while that's the easy way to grow daily actives quickly, we don't think that those sorts of techniques are very sustainable over the long term. And I think that can ultimately impact our relationship with the customer.", "And so I can give an example where if we had just in the beginning encouraged Snapchatters to add all their friends in the contact book instead of just a few of them, they might feel really uncomfortable creating Snaps and adding them to their Story, because they wouldn't know who was actually watching.", "So, ultimately, I think the way that we try to help people understand how we think about daily active user growth is really through the lens of creativity and creation, because we built our entire business on creation.", "So one of the things I think we've talked about a lot is this idea that anytime someone creates a Snap, they typically either send it to their friend which brings that friend into the Snapchat ecosystem; or they add it to their Story which obviously contributes to time spent as they provide that content to all their friends.", "And so, I think the most important thing to understand is that really we think of this daily active user growth as a function or a derivative of the growth in creation. And so we're really excited about the momentum there.", "And then I think we also talked about two things that are really important to the growth of our service. The first is affordable cell service, broadband cell service and decent to high-end smartphones. So historically we've really focused our efforts on markets where both of those are available because we can really deliver value through our products that way. So I think we think, over time, as connectivity grows, that more people will be able to use our products and really get value from them.", "So the last thing I will say is that the way we talk about DAU growth in our Company really as it pertains to creativity is about removing friction from the creative process. So we've talked about Lenses which I think are a great product. And the reason why I think that that prompted such an explosion in creativity is because it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service, because people enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that.", "So another example we gave recently was the improvements to our Android product. And so I think the more we're able to reduce friction from the creative process by improving the way our camera works in terms of Creative Tools and also just functionality, more people will feel empowered to express themselves. And I think we believe that that translates to DAU growth.", "Drew Vollero", "Mark, as it relates to your question on guidance, whether it's DAUs or peak EBITDA losses, we're going to run the Company here for the long term. We want the flexibility to make the right decision in the long term. So we're not going to be short sighted about profit decisions to make a quarter or whatever that would end up being. So at this point, there is not going to be any financial guidance coming from Snap.", "Mark Mahaney", "Thank you, Evan. Thank you, Drew.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Evan, just one follow-up on the DAU and then one for either Imran or Drew. So it sounded like the Android activations are picking up. So I guess the question is, why isn't the rest of world region keeping pace with maybe the historical trend that you've seen in that geo or what you're seeing right now in North America and Europe, with around 3 million added each quarter?", "And then do you expect that to pick up at some point in the future? And any color -- you guys just launched the World Lenses product about a month ago, so any initial read on how that uptake has been going. And that I have one follow-up.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So I think the connectivity issue is a real problem in the developing world, because it really changes the use case of our service and the behavior of people that use Snapchat.", "So, for example, in certain developing world markets, people tend to use their Wi-Fi at home or in an Internet Cafe because the broadband cell service is so expensive. And what that means is that you can't use Snap to communicate in the moment. You have to go use Snap at a wireless Cafe. And that turns Snap into much more of a broadcast, lean back kind of service.", "And so I think we can invest in growing those sorts of products in those markets. But the way that our service works, I think, is by empowering this sort of visual communication. And that is just really tough if you don't have cell service wherever you go.", "Ross Sandler", "Got it, okay. And then the question for Imran or Drew is just on the revenue breakdown. The $150 million, can you just -- Drew, you mentioned that both the Creative Tools and Snap Ads were growing rapidly. Can you just give us a little sense on how much of that came from those two buckets and where we're today on ad load for discover?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think -- look, we built the best mobile ad product. I fundamentally believe that. If you look at our Snap Ad product, they are full screen; they play with sound. And if you look at our sponsored Creative Tools -- those are the Lenses and Filters -- people are actually putting it on their pictures and videos and sharing with their friends. So they are -- that actually has very superior ROI that we have seen with many, many advertisers. And both of those sponsored Creative Tools and our Snap Ads are contributing meaningful revenue. We're not breaking those down at this point.", "With regards to ad load, look, we're very, very early days. If you look at -- as Evan mentioned, we now have more than 3 billion Snaps get created on our platform. I talked about how we have our average users are spending 30 minutes -- more than 30 minutes on our platform. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of ad load.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "I have one for Evan and one for Imran, if I can. Evan, when you think about the creative process behind product development, how much of this focus is really on products for your core audience versus products perhaps for a more mass audience, including older demographics? Maybe you can give us a sense of what you're seeing from those folks in terms of today and what products might be in the pipeline that appeal more to older audiences.", "And then, Imran, wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of adoption around the self-service platform and in particular around direct response versus brand advertisers. Do you see evidence that the mix is increasingly shifting more to the DR side? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of the way we develop product, the important thing to understand is that we're always trying to do our best to build products that are universally appealing. So things like talking with pictures or telling Stories, those are the things that we really believe are universally appealing.", "Although we do tend to market our products directly to younger people because, frankly, they are more interested in learning how to use new technology products. And that's sort of -- is partly inspired by trying to teach my grandma how to use email; and she'd really prefer to just talk on the phone. So I think now a lot of grandparents are using email, but 20 years ago it was a little different.", "And so I think, over time, that strategy has worked for us. This quarter, the 25-plus demo, time spent in sessions are up and it continues to be a larger portion of our audience. So I really do believe we've done a good job delivering products with universal appeal, even if they are initially adopted by people who are excited about new ways to use cameras and communicate.", "Imran Khan", "Yes and with regards to self-service, our journey for self-service started in October of last year when we launched our API. Now we have 24 API partners. And in Q1, 20% of our Snap Ad impressions were served through the API platform. So that is pretty -- we're very pleased with that adoption within six months of launching the product.", "And the self-service, we announced last week that we make it available. We're very excited about the initial reaction and excitement about this product. It will be broadly available first week of June, so I think it's too early to comment about it.", "With regards to DR versus brand, I think we took a deliberate approach to start our business with the brand advertising. And the reason is we've listened -- we heard from our advertisers that there was not enough good solutions for brand advertising on the mobile. And a lot of the brand advertisers are also the very large advertisers and they have very high standards. So I think by proving the ROI to the large brand advertisers, we have been able to create a very good, strong, mobile app product on the marketplace.", "We have been making great progress on the DR side. In the call, I talked about the example of Acorn where they saw a 300% increase; or Fullscreen were testing very healthy customer acquisition costs. We're seeing more and more DR customers adopting our platform and seeing great result.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.", "Eric Sheridan", "Maybe two, both around long term strategy and shorter term, as well, on the hardware side. Evan, would love to get your sense of how you think about hardware that needs to be made by Snap itself versus leveraging, especially areas like AR and VR that we might see from third parties, sort of a follow-up on Mark's question from earlier. And then one around the financials. With the step-down in revenue quarter over quarter, Q1 over Q4, is there any way you could call out the impact that Spectacles might have had in that step-down, quarter over quarter? Thanks, guys.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of our hardware strategy, our approach when we're exploring new technology is to usually work on it ourselves. So if you remember back even when we started building Publisher Stories, we really created a lot of our own content. And that's usually the best way for us to explore something really, really quickly and really learn from it. And so that's been our strategy.", "Today with Spectacles, I think it's been really exciting to see people capture memories from their perspective. There's obviously something really exciting about that. Over, I guess, 5 million Snaps have been created with Spectacles to date. And so I think we're going to keep experimenting there. And then at some point obviously, I think as we've shown with our other products, we like being a good partner and I think that's always an interesting avenue to explore.", "Drew Vollero", "So, financially, Eric, on the Spectacles side again, we launched the Spectacles.com website during the quarter. It's a modest program for us right now. We report that in other revenue. We don't break out Spectacles, per se, but it was a little more than $8 million for the quarter.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "I had two; first one for Imran. Can you just talk about what kind of content you're looking for on the Snap platform and how you ensure that you get the discoverability of that video or content in what's becoming a more crowded discover tab?", "And then second, drew, just understanding that there's seasonality, of course, in 1Q in brand spending. You're also just very early in your trajectory. But is there anything else to think about here as we go through 2017, in terms of seasonal or other kinds of comp issues through the year? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I'd actually love to take this opportunity to talk a little more broadly about our content strategy in general. The simple answer to the discoverability problem for our publishers to date has been really the application of machine learning which has really helped us show the right content to the right person in terms of the Publisher Stories content.", "But I think more broadly, we have really three great types of content on our service. The first obviously, the user Stories product that we initially created where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and they don't feel like they're part of a popularity contest. And I think that product has been really terrific.", "And I think after that, obviously, we developed Publisher Stories. And Publisher Stories I think are really interesting because we were able to really create an ecosystem that works where publishers have an incremental audience where they can monetize their content; but also build a relationship with the customers that are viewing that content that we've seen also impact their business outside of the Snap ecosystem. And that relationship is really, really important to us. And we have a loyalty metric that we share with those partners because I think they've really been able to build a relationship on Snap.", "And then I think the last one that's really fun for us and is really a new one, are the new Stories that are being created in our search product. And that's really exciting because people all over the world are experiencing really fun things. And just by contributing their Snap to Our Story, we do all the hard work on the back end to basically collect all these perspectives together, compile them into interesting Stories that everyone can enjoy. So I think this is yet another type of relationship that's being built on Snap where people around the world are seeing things from new perspectives.", "So, I think, broadly speaking, the content strategy is working well. And then I think we have some other things we're interested in, in building on in the future.", "Drew Vollero", "On the second part of your question, obviously the business is scaling quite rapidly. We were up 286% year-over-year, if you look at the revenues. As you look at the back half of the year, obviously we're building an international business. We have a salesforce now that's really starting to get traction.", "There were a couple of the events in the back half of 2016 from a seasonal perspective. We did have the Olympics in the third quarter of 2016. That was a nice bump for us. And then in the fourth quarter, we have good partnerships with college football and the NFL on the sporting side. And so you can think about that a little bit. There also was a little bit of election upside, as well, in 2016.", "But, overall, the business is just in a very different place in terms of the resources and the size of the reach that we have right now with the salesforce.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two; the first one to Evan. There is very strong engagement and time spent on the platform, but the ad deceleration was pretty steep. You talked about removing friction in engagement. I'd be curious to hear about what are the main points of friction that you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars onto the platform? What excites you most to fix that over the next couple years? And then on discover, can you just talk about the type of engagement or user adoption you're seeing on discover and what are the main ways you can drive faster discover adoption? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, sure. I think the big issue with advertising over the next decade or so, frankly, is going to be education. I think we have world-class ad units. They are delivering ROI. We've done a lot of work this year to build out the measurement side of the business. And so I think now really it's an education process and I think early adopters are seeing great results. And so we've just got to keep showing people how Snap can really work for them and drive ROI.", "And then -- sorry. As far as the discover content is concerned, I think one of the things we're really excited about is our new Shows product. I don't know if you had a chance to see it, but basically it is total -- it is content created just for Snap. So rather than a lot of the video content you're seeing I think on mobile right now which is repurposed from TV or repurposed from the Internet, we've worked with some really outstanding partners to create some awesome shows.", "And I think right now, we have about one show a day. I think that will grow through the end of the year. And these are episodes like -- Second Chance, I think what was on today; and these are the types of shows that are drawing audiences over 8 million. So we're excited about that.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Imran, it seems like you have around 11 office locations right now around the globe. It seems like the vast majority of those are in the U.S., as well as the English-speaking countries. So, when can we start to see you guys start to go more aggressively after the other large ad markets in Continental Europe and elsewhere, so that we will start seeing the monetization gap between North America and Europe close? It seems like the users are catching up, but the revenue in Europe still seems to be about 1/10th of what you're reporting in North America right now. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're very pleased with our international growth. I think if you look at in Q1, 14% of our revenue came from international market. That is up from 7% a year ago. I think we're still early on with many market, like for example in Germany, we're just getting started. We're just getting started in Nordic markets and Netherlands and things like that. So I think as we continue to expand more sellers in those markets and continue to invest, I think you will see international continue to grow as a percentage of revenue.", "Stephen Ju", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.", "Ron Josey", "I just wanted to drill a little bit more into self-service, with 20% of ads delivered through the API in the first quarter and then the pending launch of the ads manager, can you just talk about the roadmap for self-service? The tools appear to be there with support across the ad formats and want to know if Lenses is included. And then how do you manage the channel conflict between Snap's salesforce and an ad manager? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think the -- first of all, 20% of Snap, that is what flowed through the API, not Lenses and Filters. And I think what we're really committed to that it is make it very easy for any advertisers to buy a Snapchat ad. And I think a lot of the large advertisers also want to use our self-service platform because they want to try out different creatives; they want to get more real-time result. And as well as a lot of small businesses who doesn't necessarily have access to sellers or agencies -- they also want to try it out.", "And I think what you will see us that over the next year or two and on an ongoing basis, is a continued investment to make it as frictionless as possible for everybody to buy ad on our platform.", "And with regards to channel conflict, the way we manage our channel conflict is the sellers have their clienteles and we got list that clienteles what platform and how they buy ads on the platform; they get credited towards that. So we have a pretty good -- we feel very good about the channel conflict management on that.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.", "Scott Devitt", "I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about geographic mix in terms of user growth. North America and Europe continue to outperform rest of world in terms of absolute DAU adds and how to think about that throughout 2017 and future years. And then secondly, just a clarification on the Spectacles revenue that Eric asked about earlier. Could you give the number of -- for Spectacles in 4Q? And then also in 1Q just to make sure -- understood what that $8 million was -- which quarter that was in. Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Yes, on the Spectacles side, just as a quick clarification, other revenue in the fourth quarter was I think a little bit more than $4.5 million. And so the numbers I gave earlier to Eric were first quarter other revenues were a little bit more than $8 million. So that will give you a little context. And really the program began in the fourth quarter.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as far as DAU growth, we're going to continue to focus on North America and Europe where we think we can deliver the most value for customers, based on their devices and the network. And longer term, obviously, we really believe that Snapchat is for everyone. And it's just early days for us, so we're focused in North America and Europe first.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge", "Two questions. Evan, in terms of the upcoming product roadmap, could you maybe discuss what you're excited about and perhaps how you see the cadence of product innovations progressing throughout the course of the year?", "And then maybe for Imran, you mentioned Universal doubled ad spend, 2016 versus 2015. Just your thoughts on ad demand in the U.S. in 1Q -- were you pleased with it? And then how is ad demand trending, thus far in 2Q? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "So I think at this point, we're kind of famous for not giving guidance on the product pipeline. But we're obviously really excited about it and we love surprising our community; so should be a fun rest of the year.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to ad business in Q1, I was very pleased with our Q1 ad performance. And I think, as you know, that our business has more focus on brand advertisings. That's how we got started and the brand business is very seasonal. But if by that on a year-over-year basis our business grew 286% on a year-over-year basis.", "And we continue to invest in both DR and brand and continue to make the advertising business as frictionless as possible which will help us to onboard many, many advertisers on the platform which should bode well for our future advertising business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "On the DAU number, can you unpack for us a little bit? A DAU, daily active user, is obviously an incredibly high bar. Can you unpack for us a little bit how much of the growth came from adding additional users to the platform versus engaging -- increasing engagement on the platform? And then from an advertising perspective, was there any impact to the quarter from changes in the sales organization or any sort of disruption there that you felt like would have allowed the Company to potentially grow advertising faster, had you seen more stability in the quarter?", "Imran Khan", "Look, I'm not sure what sales organization change you are mentioning; but I think we continue to grow our sales organization and continue to add a lot more people in the organization. And that continues to do very well. I think we're very fortunate to hire a lot of great talent in the organization throughout the quarter. And I think the salesforce is -- remained really very focused. And I'm very pleased with the execution we're doing. Evan, do you want to take DAU?", "Evan Spiegel", "I think we talk a lot about DAU as an engagement metric. Obviously we provided a couple extra metrics this quarter, like time spent which is over 30 minutes. And obviously an overall increase in sessions on a per user basis, so those are things we're excited about. And as I mentioned, I think the more that we can remove friction from this creative process, the more people want to use our service. And that's our strategy.", "Heath Terry", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Mark Zuckerberg opened up F8 essentially saying that they are now a camera company with an augmented reality API designed to let the whole world in and innovate. And while he didn't ever say it directly, it really sounded like he wants to bury Snapchat. So, I think the question that's on every investor's mind is does Facebook scare you, why or why not? And then I have a follow-up for Imran.", "Evan Spiegel", "Look, I think if there's one thing that I'd want to communicate today, it's probably just the overall importance of creativity to our business. And I mean this from every perspective, from the team that we hire to how they work together; the creative culture that we have; the products that we have that inspire people to create. And I think our overall strategy, obviously which is to deliver value through creativity. And I think the bottom line is, like, if you want to be a creative company you've got to get comfortable with and basically enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your products if you make great stuff.", "And I think we've seen this happen a lot in technology. When Google came along, everyone really felt like they needed a search strategy. When Facebook came along, everyone felt they needed a social strategy. And now I think with Snap, with our company, we believe that everyone is going to develop a camera strategy. Because I think we really help people understand how valuable the camera is, because it's really the center of everything that we do. And I think, at the end of the day, just because Yahoo, for example, has a search box, it doesn't mean they are Google.", "Richard Greenfield", "So just to follow up on the advertising side, either for you, Evan or for Imran. Why should an advertiser, just given the magnitude of the scale of Facebook versus Snapchat -- not to mention the advertising tools -- why advertise on Snapchat versus just dumping more money into Facebook?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, I think a bunch of reasons. Number one, we have incremental audience that we talked about. Number two, we're created -- I would argue that probably the best mobile ad product on the marketplace which is what many, many, many of our advertisers are seeing, superior ROI.", "Third, I think, fundamentally, advertisers want to advertise in many different platforms so that they can reach the -- advertise at different context. And fourth, we also have a very difficult to reach audience and a very, very engaged audience, as we talked about in my prepared remarks. All advertising starts with a strong engagement and we provide incredibly strong engagements. An average user is spending more than 30 minutes on the platform. So all of those reasons I think is very, very attractive to advertisers to be on our platform.", "Richard Greenfield", "Thank you for the answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "Just a DAU question again. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on the month-to-month trends, how you exited the quarter and early Q2. And maybe just remind us a little bit of the seasonality of your user growth and user engagement.", "And then in terms of host costs per DAU, I was under the impression those were largely a function of engagement. But you said that that wasn't necessarily the case in Q1. You talked about some savings from what you're doing on the partner and side. Should we expect that those kind of savings to continue at least for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, in terms of guidance, we don't want to give intra quarter guidance. As you know that advertising business is a seasonally -- seasonal business, where Q1 is seasonally weaker. And so our business will continue to face seasonality that we see on the broader advertising market. With regards to -- I think one of the things I keep want to highlight that I have been feeling very strongly about our ad business. Again, I think in addition to the ROI we're driving for advertisers, we're also providing a lot of powerful location data. So people Snapchat as a messaging app and people open the app many times. You see a lot incredible amount of location data and that's also very, very valuable. That's also driving a very strong ROI for everything -- in addition to everything I just talked about.", "So we feel very good about our advertising business. And beyond that, I can't really comment specific to the quarter.", "Mark May", "I was talking about the DAU seasonality, how to think about that in Q2 and seasonality combined with how you exited the quarter DAU. Seasonality.", "Imran Khan", "Again, I think if you look at our business, our user growth was driven by innovation. And as we continue to improve the performance and quality, that also driving the DAU growth. And I think in terms of beyond that, I don't think we should think too much about seasonality on that.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to cost of revenue and your question, cost of revenue was $141 million in the quarter. $99 million of it is hosting costs. Another $23 million is revenue share, so those really are the two primary components of what drive it.", "Hosting costs are paid directly to our third-party infrastructure providers. We have primary business with Google and we've also brought Amazon over as well recently. There are a series of headwinds and tailwinds in that business. Growing engagement, to your point and new users cost us more because they are variable cost contracts. The more that consumers use our app -- the more that they open it, the more that they Snap on in, they more they download content, the more that we incur charges.", "So in terms of the prices that we pay for those services, because we signed two new contracts, we got lower prices with both of those providers. And so that provided a significant tailwind for us. And it really was the upside that you saw in sequential costs. Our costs went from $113 million last quarter to $99 million there. And that is in a quarter where we saw significant growth in engagement in some of the main attributes as well as we saw the user growth. You can see we added another 8 million users in the quarter.", "So it really was that offset in pricing that we got from the two contract providers that really drove hosting costs lower. And revenue share is a piece of that. Revenue share was up slightly in the quarter. We had restructured a couple of deals. They are now more fixed-fee deals as opposed to percentage of revenue deals. Those will give us leverage if we're able to grow sales in the back half of the year; but, in the short term, raised our expenses in the first quarter.", "Mark May", "And I guess my question is as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, are you -- is host costs going to more than closely align with DAU and engagement growth? Or some of these cost savings from the new contract is going to continue to be a tailwind for the next couple of quarters?", "Drew Vollero", "The contractual pricing is, going forward, we signed a five-year deal with each of the companies, so it's new pricing that goes forward from this point. As it relates to where it all comes out, as I said, there is a series of headwinds and tailwinds. It really is a function, first and foremost, about engagement and how much engagement happens on the site and how many users that we add. Those really are what drive the costs. In terms of the year-over-year changes in the contract, the contract does have lower prices for our key services as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "A couple questions. Get a lot of questions on competition, so wondering if you can comment at all on churn as you look at your user base in Q4 or Q1. Any notable changes there, either Android or Apple platforms, would help us understand if competition is having any impact.", "And then on advertisers, just any thoughts on -- we saw the sequential decline, but how did you do on adding new advertisers in the first quarter? Did your total number of advertisers grow sequentially in Q1? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Overall, especially in the last half of last year, we had a really tough time with Android. That's still showing up in the numbers, as we mentioned. We added -- roughly 20% of our net adds from Android in Q4 and 30% in Q1. So we're making progress. But it's taking time and we're definitely digging out of a performance hole on Android. The low-hanging fruit, I would say, has been tackled in this past quarter, but we're making some larger structural changes that I think will make a big difference on Android over time.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, with regards to advertising, as we're -- continue to educate the market, one thing to keep in mind there our ad business -- we really start monetizing our business. The first ad ran on Snapchat in Q4 of 2014 and our ad business is still very, very nascent. So as we continue to educate the market, expand the sales force, opening new market, we continue to see more and more advertisers coming to our platform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel.", "Brian White", "Evan, I wonder if you could comment a little bit about the smartphone market. More smartphones are going to come with 3D sensors. It's going to support more AR activities. So I'm wondering how we should think about this as either a threat or an opportunity for Snap. So that's one question. Second question is just long term thoughts on China and also on Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Obviously all these improvements and sensors, et cetera, are really exciting for us and obviously fun to play with. The tough thing with any of these sort of device-specific improvements is that they are really hard for all of our community to enjoy. So instead, we've really invested in building a lot of our own technology that works well with a single camera. So you see that technology in World Lenses; it looks simple, but that surface detection is tricky to do with single-camera devices. And so we invested a lot in making these next-generation AR products available to our user base. But, yes, obviously always excited about new technology.", "And then -- sorry, the second question?", "Brian White", "Just on China. The long term thoughts on China and Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, thanks. Sorry about that. In terms of China, we've learned so much from the Chinese market. In the very early days, Tencent invested in our business and we had the chance to spend a lot of time with them. We've always been in awe, frankly, of the innovation happening over there. And that's really as far as our relationship with China has progressed today. But we've invested in building out some engineering there and obviously it's really exciting for our business.", "And then Japan -- obviously a great market and we've been working more recently to develop content that specifically appeal -- Lenses and Creative Tools that appeal specifically to the Japanese market. So that's a market we're excited about over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Maybe a quick one on the infrastructure side of things. You mentioned the deals with Google and Amazon. Maybe thinking about how you feel about the interchangeability between the two services. When you think about how you engineer, do you build stuff in a modular fashion so you can quickly move it over from one cloud to another? And any color or comments around that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, the thing you're talking about, sort of like containerization, I think is definitely the long term goal with products like this. But the interesting thing about the state of the cloud market today is really how these different providers have entered the market.", "So you have AWS which was really created because Amazon was trying to meet the needs of their customers around Christmastime. They built all this excess capacity and then rented it out. And Google, obviously, who has entered the market and they have a totally different and very specific use case around search.", "And so what ends up happening is that both of these companies build different services. And so, for example, recently we've moved some of our operations to an Amazon data store that's a little bit less redundant than a Google data store, for example, but saves us a bunch of money. So right now, I think we're really picking and choosing the different products we want to use based on the offerings from the two providers.", "But I do think, yes, long term, obviously, the dream for the cloud is this idea of containerization. And that's something we continue to invest in, but that -- that's a sort of a step-by-step, not an overnight kind of thing.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ms. Sam Stewart, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Sam Stewart", "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagements and financial metrics for the second quarter of 2017 which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our second quarter 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement.

We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com.", "At times in our prepared comments or in response to your questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Good afternoon and welcome to our Q2 earnings call, we made a lot of great progress this quarter. Snapchaters now visit more frequently, spend more time and create more snaps than ever before, both in aggregate and on per user basis. Daily active user growth remains solid with 173 million people using Snapchat every day on average during the quarter an increase of 4.4% from Q1. ", "User growth was especially strong in North America with 4 million net additional users since last quarter. We also reached and important milestone in our core markets with over 25% of smartphone users in the U.S., UK and France now using Snapchat every day. Monetization is also progressing nicely although we are still in very early stages as we continue to build out our self-service and programmatic infrastructure. ", "Quarterly revenue increased 153% year-over-year to 181.7 million. Adoption of our ad platform is increasing with more than half of our all Snap ad impressions delivered through our self-service platform and our API this quarter. As our automated capabilities improve, we are running more campaigns from more advertisers resulting in a greater variety of ads on our platform. This enables us to build a robust auction and drive more relevant ads yielding better results for our advertisers and a better experience for our community. Additionally, this auction allows advertisers to optimize their campaigns across our inventory to achieve their specific objectives further increasing ROI. ", "At the heart of this growth and engagement daily active users and revenue is the creativity of our community which is one of the things that makes Snapchat so unique. Each one of our daily active users creates over 20 snaps per day on average to express themselves and communicate with their friends. The best part of working with Snap is leveraging the creativity of our communities to build new products like maps, search and memories where we empower Snapchaters to do more with what they create. ", "We found that the best way to grow our business is to build products that inspire our community to create snap like lenses and creative tools and provide new outlets like Custom Stories and Maps, so that our community can share their creations with their friends. When we're able to do both of these things well, we create a virtuous cycle where our community both creates and use more snaps. ", "This quarter, we continued to invest in empowering creativity with new lenses and creative tools. Today, we\u2019re focused primarily on front facing camera effects that augment selfies but this quarter we announced a product designed specifically for the outward facing camera on smartphones, we call this product World Lenses, and we worked hard to build the underlying technology to recognize the world and render interactive objects and experiences on top of it. Its early days but we have had so much fun watching our community interact with World Lenses. ", "Our dancing hot dog is most likely the world's first augmented reality super star, viewed over 1.5 billion times in snaps created by our community. We released several new creative tools this quarter for our community to express themselves and have fun. People can now create custom stickers, use the magic eraser to remove an object, add a playful backdrop or alter the background color of their snaps. Creative tools are particularly important on our platform because we want to empower people to express themselves and communicate visually instead of simply taking a photograph. ", "We have found that when we offer more creative tools, our community creates more snaps. With so many snaps created every day on our service, we want to make sure that our community has many different ways to share their snaps both directly with friends and more broadly with the public. We watched stories in 2013 and have constantly iterated on the product as engagement has grown over the years. ", "We created a new type of story this quarter, Custom Stories. Custom Stories are perfect for occasions like parties, vacations and wedding or really any other time you want to collaborate on a story with a specific group of friends or around a specific location. We've had so much fun watching stories created by our friends with their own special events. ", "This quarter saw more story snap views than ever before both in aggregate and per user, not only with regards to user generated content but also premium content provided by our partners. There are more people watching more publisher stories than ever before with publisher story views increasing 30% quarter-over-quarter. ", "We continue to evolve our celebrated stories format to serve the demand for different types of mobile content experiences. One example of this evolution is the growing popularity of shows on Snapchat. We are working with a number of partners that are embracing this mobile story selling format doubling the number of new shows premiering on our service this quarter and compared to Q1. The engagement around shows is particularly exciting.", "For example, Phone Swap, a new show created through our joint venture with Vertical Networks often sees over 10 million viewers for a single episode putting it on par with some of the most popular shows on television. The success of shows is already extending beyond our service. Phone Swap is getting picked up for television and the Voice on Snapchat was nominated for an Emmy Award. We can't wait to see how shows continue evolve. ", "This quarter we also launched Snap Map, a whole new way to see the world. Snap Map is a traditional map designed to get you where you are going it\u2019s a new site of map for figuring out where you want to go. Since the launch of Snap Map content submitted to our story has increased 30% demonstrating that providing new ways to distribution snaps further incentivizes our community to create more snaps and contribute their point of view.", "Memories is another great example of how we have been able to methodically expand upon a snap creation and consumption experience in Snapchat. Historically Snapchat was always known at least in part to the assembling [ph] nature of the content on our service. Recently however we have been pleased with the growth of our Memories product they allows our community to save their creations and share them at a later date. Now over 250 million snaps are saved to Memories every day creating a great foundation for products that make it easy to reminisce. It's always fun to look back on some of our favorite snaps and we believe that Memories will become an even more important part of the Snapchat experience in the future. ", "We've seen great traction with many of our new products. From lenses and creative tools and inspire snap creation to search maps and memories that provide new ways to view snaps. Although many of these products are in their infancy, we should be able to improve them quickly as our community adopts them and let us know how we can better serve their needs. We love that our community continues to experiment with and embrace new products and we are excited that these new behaviors are driving more engagement on Snapchat. ", "We continue to make progress on Android performance this quarter and we've been able to address most of the low hanging fruit that we believe has impacted the customer experience. The remaining performance improvements will come from larger structural changes to our service that will take some time. This quarter we focused on building systems and processes to ensure that we can maintain quality and performance over the long-term. We've defined key customer facing metrics that we believe directly impact use and engagement and we are working hard to improve them and at a minimum reach parity with our iOS application. ", "We are still on the early stages of making these improvements and I would estimate that we won't begin to see the meaningful results of these efforts until the second quarter of next year. This is an unfortunate side effective of the past pace of innovation that prioritizes product execution over the architectural integrity of our software. We've made some great additions to our team this quarter who can help us move as quickly as possible to improve the quality and performance of our service and we are looking forward to making more progress. We're committed to delivering a fantastic Android experience to our community.", "As a final note, given the amount of speculation around the lack of exploration I feel it is important to note that Bobby and I will not sell any of shares this year. The company will withhold the shares needed to satisfy our few tax of holding obligations. We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap. ", "Thanks again for joining us today. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We made great progress this quarter on the monetization side. Advertising revenue increased 146% year-over-year and 25% quarter-over-quarter. Our community grew to an average of 173 million daily active users. This growth was primarily driven by users in the U.S. and Canada with over 40% of our net ads in Q2 coming from these countries.", "Today we have over 69 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada which are two of the most monetizable markets in the world. Together these two countries represent half of all global mobile advertising spent, our traction in core markets like the U.S. and Canada puts us in a great position as we would scale our monetization by allowing our advertisers to leverage our platforms to reach. ", "For example, an advertiser wanting to reach 13 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. would access our publicly available ad manager tool and reach 75% of the total U.S. population in that age group over the course of a multi week campaign. As Evan mentioned we're seeing incredible engagement from our community, which is very exciting for our advertising business. ", "For example, story snap views are higher than they had ever been before. This is important because it generates more inventory and we know advertisers have demand for competing formats like our full screen video Snap ads. An average daily active user that plays with Lenses spends over three minutes doing so daily creating a unique opportunity for advertisers to get lots of engagement with a sponsor lens. This strong growth and engagement trends from our community will allow us to keep scaling our advertising business in the future.", "We remain focused on three key areas that I outlined last quarter. First, enhancing our ad offerings for both brands and direct response advertisers. Second, developing efficient tools for our advertisers. And third, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ", "First, enhancing our ad offerings; building ad products that solve a variety of advertisers' business objective is a key priority for us. Over 75% of the top 100 adage leading national advertisers spent on our platform last quarter. And what's more important our existing customers are spending more money with us. In fact, revenue from advertisers on a parent level that spent with us in the first half of 2016 grew 142% year-over-year during the first half of 2017.", "Despite significant investment growth by our existing partners we still have a lot more room to grow. The recent launch of our self-service platform will help us not only tap in to additional spend from our existing advertiser base but also on board long tail and mid tail advertisers. We expect this combination of increasing spend by existing advertisers and increasing our advertiser count will help us drive solid revenue growth in the future. ", "This quarter we also expanded our global capabilities with our ads now available in 10 additional countries including Hong Kong, India and Israel. With this expansion, our advertisers can reach users in 39 different countries. ", "I would like to share an example of how we have worked with one partner, Time Warner, to become a larger part of their strategy. Time Warner was an early adopter of our platform who went from experimenting on our platform to scaling that investment across all of our products and offerings. ", "On the advertising side, we've worked with their movie studio Warner Brothers on 48 movie releases since 2015. Most recently we've partnered with them on the release of Wonder Woman. We helped them reach Snapchatters in 26 countries globally. They used a multi-product approach to drive great results including Geofilters, Lenses and the Snap Ad web view Attachments with a custom-built game. On average Snapchatters spend nearly one-minute engaging with this ad. Overall, the campaign was highly effective with more than half of Snapchatters exposed to both the Snap Ads and lenses, said they were likely to see the film in theaters. ", "On the content side, two of Time Warner's companies, CNN and Bleacher Report were among our first publishers when we launched Discover in January of 2015. We worked closely with them to create engaging and effective content for our community. Both brands have seen great success to-date. On Snapchat alone, CNN and Bleacher Report have global monthly audiences of over 12 million and 16 million respectively. ", "It's also important that we offer ad formats to help solve direct response objectives. I want to talk about the progress we've made here which we are very pleased with. Here're two examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments, our direct response product continues to perform well. ", "First, The Economist used our Snap Ads with Attachments product to launch their first UK campaign in June. The campaign was a huge success. The average cost per lead on Snapchat was \u00a310.28 compared to \u00a362 on display and six time more efficient cost per lead than their other marketing channels. ", "Second, Active and audience fitness apps, also used our Snap Ads with Attachments product to drive both installed and high-quality users. With this campaign, we are able to deliver users at a 30% lower cost per install than their other channels. But Active wasn't just looking for the lowest price, they were also looking for strong engagement, that's why we are thrilled that the users they acquired were highly engaged with Active audio workout programs. ", "Another area we continue to invest in is to allow advertisers to reach exactly the audience they want to reach. For example, a simple [ph] looking to advertise to both parents and young adults can leverage several of our targeting capabilities to ensure they reach the most relevant audience. They can use a combination of our native targeting capabilities called Snap Lifestyle category to reach family travelers, as well as our third-party data to reach family vacationers. This allows them to reach more than 8 million Snapchatters in the U.S. They can also narrow in on married moms over the age of 35 who control household budgets, and audience segments that we call money minders and reach over 4 million Snapchatters with real buying power. We're very excited that we can offer lower prices combined with high engagement, a winning combination that continues to drive our advertising business. ", "The second area that we remain focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers; in order to scale our advertising business, we need to make it easy for any and all advertisers to buy on our platform. 60% of Snap Ads impressions are now being delivered programmatically, more than doubled from last quarter. Because we're still in early stages of monetization we're focused on onboarding as many advertisers as possible. Advertisers can bid for desired business objectives like apps installs or video views and our platform will optimize that delivery in real time. Increasing automation on our apps platform is driving better ROI for our advertisers. In fact, for our app install advertisers, the average cost per app install has decreased 80% since the launch of our auction. Over time though, we expect the auction dynamic and increased demand to drive up pricing levels. Our focus in coming months will be making it even easier for advertisers to find exactly what they are looking for on our self-service platform. ", "And finally, the third area of focus is further proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Over 90% of retail transactions still happen in physical stores. Advertisers are very egger to measure the effectiveness of their digital spending in the real world. That\u2019s why in June we announced the acquisition of location based analytics and ad measurement company called Placed. With Placed we will be able to measure activities such as store visits and offline purchases that prove digital ads are driving real value for advertisers. Placed is one of many measurement partners that we work with including Nelson, Oracle Data Cloud, Newster, [indiscernible] Moat and several others. We're committed to working with the best third-party measurement companies to provide transparency to our advertisers. ", "Our investments in creating an offline sales measurement ecosystem are paying off. I would like to share measurement results from three different industry categories that show our advertising is driving profit for our customers. ", "First, in the retail apparel category Snapchat drove a ROAS or return on app spend that was 2.7 times the average ROAS across all online and offline media spend for best category as measured by Newster market share. ", "Second, in the movie theatrical release category, Snapchat drove a ROAS that was 5.1 times the average ROAS for all media spend as measured by Newster market share.", "And third, Snapchat drove an average ROAS of $3.53 at gross 16 consumer packaged goods campaign. This outperformed the average ROAS of $2.58 for mobile advertising campaigns for Q4 of 2016 as measured by Nielsen Catalina Solutions. ", "We\u2019re very pleased with what we've accomplished in the first half of the year, looking ahead we're going to stay focused on scaling our adverting business and investing in the right areas to succeed in the long-term. ", "Thank you everyone for the time and now I will hand it over to Drew. ", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results featured growing revenues and expanding gross margins with continued investments in people and acquisitions. ", "In the quarter, we made strong progress against our three financial goals which are designed to pave our path to profitable growth and prioritize strategic investments along the way. As a quick reminder, we\u2019re focused on executing these financial strategies. ", "First, driving both revenue and ARPU growth while expanding gross margins; second, moderating capital intensity to ensure strong EBITDA to free cash flow conversion and third, investing in front house resources and M&A to build rapid scale in innovation and monetization. ", "Let me build on incremental revenues and growing gross margins. In the quarter, revenues grew 153% year-over-year to $181.7 million and grew 21% sequentially. Looking regionally, revenues in North America were $147.6 million up 126% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Revenue outside North America showed nice progress. Total international revenues were $34.1 million or 19% of sales up from 9% a year ago and 14% sequentially. ", "Looking across the product line revenue from both Creative Tools and Snap Ads increased year-over-year and sequentially. In the quarter revenue increases were driven by substantial gains in ad impressions partially offset by lower Snap Ad pricing. Impression gains were higher for both Creative Tools and Snap Ads. As Imran noted more than half of Snap Ads were served by auction more than double from last quarter. The mixed shift fueled solid growth in Snap Ad impressions but this mix shift also resulted in lower Snap Ad blended pricing as we moved from selling reserved inventory at set prices to selling unreserved inventory at auction rates. ", "Our goal overtime would be to try Snap Ad pricing higher through strong auction participation and improved targeting. Across the company Snap sold revenue was a $164.8 million, partner sold revenue was $11.5 million and other revenues were $5.4 million substantially all of which was driven by spectacles. ", "Average revenue per user or ARPU was a $1.05 in the second quarter up from $0.50 a year ago and up from $0.90 in Q1. North America remains a leading indicator for the potential of the business and North American ARPU was a $1.97 up 85% versus last year and up 9% sequentially.", "Consistent with our first strategy, gross margins grew nicely in the second quarter. Please note that when I discuss expense figures and gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Gross margins grew to 19% in Q2 up 5,100 basis points from the year ago and 1,400 basis points sequentially. Gross margins benefitted from three key drivers. First, strong profit flow through from incremental ad dollars; second, stable hosting cost per user and third, cost leverage on revenue share expenses. ", "In the quarter user engagement, time spend, snaps created and other metrics grew nicely. But our engineering saving initiatives nearly offset all of those cost increases. Sequentially user hosting cost rose only slightly from $0.60 per user in Q1 to $0.61 in Q2. ", "Additionally, revenue share expenses fell sequentially from 16% of sales to 13% of sales due to the expanded monetization of products without revenue shares such as My Story. Overall the scale potential of our financial model is starting to take shape. Measuring year-over-year we've seen over 50% flow through in our incremental sales to gross margin dollars. But sequentially we saw an 83% flow through in the quarter at a $32.0 million increase in sales drove $26.7 million in incremental gross profit dollars. ", "We made strong progress against our second financial strategy which is to moderate the capital intensity of our business. Our primary lever remains our cloud hosting strategy where we rely on partner expertise, their scale and capital to serve our customers. ", "We continue to see both competitive cost to serve at $0.61 in the second quarter and a competitive advantage on our capital spending. Capital expenses in the quarter were modest and consistent at $19.4 million primarily driven by facility expansion to support our growing organization. For the last 12 months, our CapEx was $75 million which is less than $0.50 per current user, well below what other company spend. ", "We made good progress on our third financial strategy which is to make investments in the front of house resources in M&A to rapidly scale innovation and monetization. In the quarter headcount grew from 2,360 to approximately 2,600 including acquisitions. 90% of the new hires were in engineering and sales similar to Q1.", "Overall, operating expenses increased 17% sequentially to $228.7 million due to higher personnel cost. Annualized cost per employee were pretty consistent but up slightly versus prior periods at $351,000 per employee. We made additional investments in M&A which the company will do selectively. ", "During the quarter, we spent slightly more than $200 million in cash with some other performance considerations. In it remarks Imran spoke to the strategic benefits of our recent acquisitions have placed. Please note the company was acquired in July so we reflect that acquisition in our Q3 financials.", "Overall, net loss was $443.1 million for the quarter which included expected stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $242.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $194.0 million compared to a loss of $188.2 million in Q1 and a loss of $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. ", "We remain in a strong cash position, cash and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter was $2.8 billion. As of June 30, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1.181 billion and 1.446 billion on a fully diluted basis. ", "Recently with the expiration of the lockup, RSUs [ph] were settled for employees between March 2, 2017 and July 29, 2017. As a result, we withheld from employees approximately 7.8 million shares or around 105 million based on the July 28, 2017 closing price. The tax payments were funded from cash on hand. The shares are no longer considered outstanding for accounting purposes. As future employee shares vest, we will periodically evaluate this net settled share strategy. ", "As we move forward we wanted to share some thoughts on the balance of 2017. With respect to the seasonal trajectory of the advertising revenue in the prior year, our Q3 2016 results benefited from demand related to the summer Olympics and elections. Normalizing for those increases our revenue grew $39 million from Q2 2016 to Q3 2016.", "For hosting expenses, we experienced a substantial increase in time spent in Q2 coinciding with the Maps product launch. Increased time is a strategic benefit for our business, but we pay more for additional usage. Late in Q2 hosting cost per user increased around 10% or so versus the Q2 run rate. ", "Finally, our Q2 hiring pace was slow in the recent quarters, in the short term we plan to apply a similar approach in pace as we focus organic hiring from early on engineering in sales, but keep in mind hiring can be lumpy from quarter-over-quarter. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to the current pace. ", "With that I would now like to turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I can, one on Ad product and one on engagement, first on Ad product, wondering what you're seeing from the ramp in API buying the roll out of self service and just better measurement and targeting. Are you seeing a real tangible response from these tools such that you think you can kind of scale meaningfully in the second half from your largest advertisers? ", "And then second one maybe for Evan, with the new product rolling out across search and maps, wondering if you can elaborate on what kind of uptake you're seeing here whether this is driving really more engagement or DAU growth, you just indicated engagement really picked up recently, maybe you can elaborate on that? Thanks.", "Drew Vollero", "I'll take the first question and Evan will take the second, so we're very excited about the traction we saw from our self-service and API, just to remind everyone that we launched our API in October and self-service was launched in Q2 and we've already seen in Q2 60% of all Snap Ad buying -- Snap Ad impressions were delivered to our self-service and API platform, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment for such a really since such a short period of time. ", "And we're also seeing that our direct response advertisers are seeing good traction, so are all brand advertisers. In my prepared remarks, I talked about how cost per install have decreased 80% since the launch of our app install business; so, we're very-very excited and we think there's a great opportunity to scale the business as we brought in more-and-more advertisers on the platform.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, to your product question, we're obviously super excited about maps, it's early days. I don't have any additional metrics to share beyond what I mentioned earlier, but I think the most important thing for us as it pertains to maps, is introducing the concept that maps can be used for discovery and not just for directions and so really excited that people are using our map to learn about the world. ", "I think the other thing that\u2019s important to note is that maps is a great example of how we can use all the different unique pieces of Snapchat to make a totally new product. So, for example, maps combines our intimate front graph, emojis and also our story, as all the story submissions from all over the world to create a product that's obviously very complex, but yet really simple to use. So, I think maps is a great example of the innovation that really leverages the product foundation we've built over the years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Andrew [indiscernible] on for Ron. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you guys help us understand engagement with Search on Snapchat, now that we're six months into the product? ", "And then with the Snap certified partners program that you guys announced in June, how are you guys balancing that with the sales force, can you just help us understand the [indiscernible] how you're dealing with that? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, so again I think early days on search as people are learning that they can search for stories and not just their friends, the pre-type experience that we've when you tap into search is a really important part of that learning process and I think we're getting better at showing really interesting content depending on who you are, so for instance baseball -- you see a bunch of baseball stories and also teaches, concepts that there's a story for everything, so, early days there but I think it's a great opportunity.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to the channel conflict we view our sales force as a consultant for our partners, so their job is to educate the market, how to buy ad and how to leverage our platform to deliver the ROI for them, and we want to make it incredibly easier for them to buy ad on our platform however they want to, so they can buy directly through insertion order or they can use our certified partners or they can come to our self-service platform and buy through that. So, I think our self-service gets credit regardless how the client buys on our platform but their job is to educate the market and solving the clients' business problem and which they are doing a great job. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Brian Nowak ", "The first one on the ad monetization, I know it's very early in the monetization but can you just talk about some of the main points of friction, you still you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars on the platform and specifically around the API and the self-service, just talk to what you have to change to really drive faster growth there. ", "And then the second one, could you talk about some of the structural change that you had to make to improve the Android product over the next year? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "I think first of all I think it's important to recognize that we launched the self-service in Q2 and so I think we're still early days, but I think few things we have to work on, number one, onboard more advertisers, make it even easier for people to buy on our platform, now people can buy static image ad on our platform and other kind of things, the third thing is we need to train people how to leverage our platform, every platform is different and what works in one platform, not necessarily work in other platform, so working on the education process. So those are the few things that we're working through it. As you saw we've onboarded quite a significant amount of static ad partners on our platform and we continue to do so. But we\u2019re pretty happy with what we\u2019ve seen so far on our self-service platform. ", "Drew Vollero", "I'm hesitant to get for a deepened with the technical stuff but I can give sort of simple example, we started testing its migration last week, migrating our Android application from a text view to a surface view, [indiscernible] so make a huge difference in performance, swiping, camera start, the frame rate of the camera and that\u2019s an example of just a larger structural change. There are a number of changes we're making around threading [ph] any application, it should make a difference but [indiscernible] across the entire platform and so it will necessarily take longer. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Devitt with Stifel. ", "Scott Devitt ", "Imran one for you and Evan one for you, first one as the ad platform continues to be build out, it does seem like the business potentially reaches these points where it can have monetization and selection and ARPU expands very quickly in a short period of time. So, I was wondering Imran if you can explain whether there is any validity that assertion on my behalf and if so, what are the sign post we should be watching for in terms of products that you discussed on the call or otherwise in the ad business to look forward in seeing that over the next six to 12 months. ", "And then secondly for Evan, would just be interested in how content density of location based pictures or the Discovery feature ramping in maps, how that is changing the way that users are posting content to make content more publicly available into Discovery features like that. ", "And then finally without giving away specifics, Evan how do you feel about the product pipeline for the rest of the year? Thank you. ", "Imran Khan", "So, Scott on your first question you're absolutely right and we feel the same way. I think if you look at our business there are multiple drivers, we started our business focusing on large advertisers and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we are seeing. I've talked about how on parent levels things are advertisers are spending on our platform grew 142% year-over-year during the first half of 2017 compared to first half of 2016. ", "One of the big friction point for many advertisers to buy ad on our platform was they wanted a self-service platform access and we launched the self-service platform and we are transitioning our Snap ad buying to our self-service platform and we talked about how 60% of all Snapchat impression buying happened through self-service and API. But as we're bringing more and more advertisers on our auction platform that would be a significant driver for our growth on our platform. So, there is a lot of small business and medium sized business that we need to onboard and that will drive the significant growth for that. So, I think what I'm really-really excited about, what you should think about that continued progress in the self-service and our progress on bringing these S&P businesses on our platform. ", "Evan Spiegel", "As it pertains to maps, obviously I mentioned the increase in submissions to our story which is the publicly available content following the release of maps and I think that's just an example of this virtuous cycle where people when they submit their snaps and they see that\u2019s being viewed by folks all over the world and then they see that you can't grow up in our release products like maps, I think it's sort of self-fulfilling. So very excited about that and sort of excited to continue to expand on these different outlets for creativity for folks on our service. You mentioned sort of the broader product pipeline, very excited about that and this is what we will love to do over here, so we're having a great having time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler ", "I had two questions on ad seasonality and on Discover. Drew, just to follow up you said that last year in 3Q we had the Olympics and the election, currently the street expects about 50% quarter-on-quarter growth in the third quarter and you just did 21% in the second quarter, so given that we won't have seasonality or we won't have the Olympics and election, can you speak to that 50% how comfortably you feel about that.", "And then based on our math, Discover revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter at around $60 million, so just talk about where the ad load is in Discover and if that map is correct, where the acceleration is happening between stories and then the lenses left inside of the app? Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Look at couple of levels here, we don\u2019t get into the sales forecasting business so what we try to do is give you visibility to the comp from last year. Equal [ph] last year revenues from 71 million in second quarter last year to 128 million in the third quarter of last year. We did have a nice benefit from the two things that I called out with the summer Olympics and then also we had a little bit of an election bump as well. If you normalize to that, that gain was more like $39 million gains so you can get a sense on sort of the size of that bump in the quarter so we thought that would help provide some perspective as you think about sales in the back half of the year. ", "As it relates to where the advertising is being placed it's hard for me to comment on a particular product line. I will say though that we certainly had a lot of success with Snap-ads broadening them across the platform, you can see that in our revenue share expenses, our revenue share expenses fell 300 basis points and that really was just advertisements being placed more on places where we don\u2019t have revenue share agreements like custom stories. So anyway, that was really the way you can put those pieces together but overall, we saw a good breath of Snap ads across both the Discover platform and the My Story platforms.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thank I'm following up just it's interesting, following up Ross' questions. What for Imran seasonality on Drew on the same question of revenue share expense. So, Imran you said in May [indiscernible] conference had which you considered the company more likely look at an agency or salvation company and seasonality your 3Q, 2Q, 1Q, given your mix is changing in 2Q does is comment still valid or do you think that we're going to see seasonality, it looks more akin to some of your digital peers.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're still early. I think if you look at our big brand business is 2-years-old and our self-service business it was just launched in Q2 and while we are very excited about the traction we're seeing and the growth we're seeing but it will take some time to get the equilibrium. And so, it will take some time, so over the years yes seasonality will be more and more muted in the business but it will take some time.", "Michael Nathanson", "And then for Drew, on Ross' last question, what was the last 3 quarters on page 6 on the revenue share cost, its been flat so I know you've done a good job of finding other places to monetize but what can we learn more broadly about the flatness there, what's going on in underline may be usage trends or just selling against whatever there is Discovery I guess past three quarters.", "Drew Vollero", "The big thing to remember about Discover at a high level is it\u2019s a good partnership between the company and the publishers, that business works because both sides of the equation make money. I think we continue to slide an awful lot of ads within the Discover platform. I think the difference over time has really been broadening other avenues for distribution outside of the Discover platform. And so really what you\u2019re seeing is that the revenue gains are being flat at some times on different platforms. ", "There is a little bit that I talked about in the first quarter call as well where we restructured a couple of agreements to these sort of more fixed key arrangements so there is a little bit of something in that well but for the most part really the ability to leverage that expense has being our ability to put advertisements outside of the Discover partnerships as we grow, but first and foremost Discover partnerships we believe our long term partnership and it's important that both sides, both the publishers and the company make money doing that and that\u2019s really what we're focused on first and foremost.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "First, you talked about more than 50% of the impression has been coming from the auction and just that it seems lower price Snap ads or is auction is dragging the account. So now that you have more market based price discoveries, is there further risk just Snap ads pricing in the near term and how does that change or alter your direct sales efforts if it does. ", "And then secondly Drew, is there anything that you can talk about just on 4Q, certainly seems like the NFL and holiday should return so I don't think there is anything that normal there but anything to call out as we look deeper into the year. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, Imran mentioned over 60% of Snap ads were purchased through our auction, which is more than double last quarter and we believe overall that the transition to a bided auction is the best way to grow our business over the long term but you're right, even though pricing is lower in the short term as we're on board more advertisers. I think lower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage, especially in the short term because it provides an incentive for advertisers to get over the hurdle of having to learn how to use Snap, and given the dynamics that we're seeing in the industry in the marketplace, where mobile ad pricing seems to be increasing pretty quickly due to limited impressions, we think that this offering of lower prices and high engagement is really attractive to advertisers and hopefully as we're seeing we'll incentivize them onboard quickly and take advantage of this.", "Drew Vollero", "As it relates to your second question I think you're thinking about the right key drivers seasonally in the fourth quarter of 2016, revenues went from a 128 million to 166 million, our drivers really were at that point that holiday bump that you get. We do have a as you mentioned strong partnerships both the NFL and college football, those really -- their strongest parts are really in that fall season as well, so those are really the two big drivers. We did have a little bump from an election standpoint but not enough to call out, but those are really the two key drivers, we do think there'll be a Christmas in our deals with both the NFL and college football are even deeper partnerships this year. So, I think we should -- I think we'll look forward to the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Another one along the lines of the auction dynamics and how it impacts pricing, just given how quickly the self-service platform has ramped, would you say that the bulk of the pricing pressure that you'll see on the overall business will be largely behind us by the end of the year or is this something that will likely continue to be a headwind for bit longer than that? ", "And then another question, your monetization relative to your public peers is significantly lower, one of the questions that we get is out of the significant daily usage that you have on the platform how much of that is spent doing things that might be more difficult to directly monetize versus activities where you have a real opportunity to monetize?", "Imran Khan", "I think on your second question I think if you go to our self-service platform you can see that a significant portion of our DAU is actually you can reach them through our self-service platform, so these are fairly monetizable audience base. And one of the fact that we don't do growth hacking like notification and things like that, our users actually come to our platform on their own, and they spend a lot of time on it, and that makes a great opportunity to monetize them. ", "And with regards to pricing, look we don't want to get into the guidance but one of the thing is that we are super excited, the kind of ROI that some of our advertisers are seeing on our platform. We're only two years into monetization and we want to onboard as many advertisers as possible on our platform and deliver incredible ROI for them, primarily in an environment when there's not enough mobile video inventory on the marketplace; so we're [indiscernible] with it, where we are with that. Drew, I don't know if you have anything to add. ", "Mark May", "Imran, just to clarify your first answer I wasn't talking about the total users that can be monetized, I was talking about the time that they spend of that 30 minutes plus, how much of that time is spent in activities where you can naturally monetize that activity -- their time...", "Evan Spiegel", "I think yes, this is an important thing to understand about our business obviously we monetize creation with our creation tools, and then that fans out into communication and into our stories products and so in that sense the communication products and the stories product create the audience for their creative tools and obviously we monetize stories with Snap Ads. So, I think you\u2019re seeing the behavior across the platform being monetized, again as Imran's mentioned very early stages. But we're monetizing engagement across the service. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Eric Sheridan ", "May be two, one going back to the auction dynamics, is there any sense you can give us about the pace of growth of breadth in the advertiser base over the last 12 months and how you see that trending over the next 12 months so we can get a bit sense of some of the tail winds around the base of advertisers that are coming into the platform.", "And second, one of the big areas of hiring in the ad sales force, Imran wanted to know if you can give us an update on efficiency in the ad sales team, how that ramps and what that might mean for tailwinds in the business over the next six to 18 months as people get up to productivity. Thanks. ", "Imran Khan", "On your first question, I think we're seeing more and more direct response advertisers are coming to our platform and now that we have self-service, that was one of that biggest ask when you talk to them what they wanted to see from us. And they are coming to our platform and they are seeing great results and we\u2019re pretty pleased with it and we continue to optimize it.", "And I think we launched self-service again in Q2 and we're seeing good start and I think and I'm very excited what possible in terms of number of advertisers on board on our platform. ", "With regards to self-efficiencies, I think as Drew pointed out that in Q2 our head count growth rate moderated significantly, a big reason is moderation in sales and marketing organization and I think what you will see that we expect continue to see improved productivity out of our sales organization as we rolled out all of this efficient buying tools for our advertisers, so I think that should will be a going trend going forward. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ", "Jason Helfstein ", "I just want to dig into scale versus measurement. How much of the friction on the advertiser side is because advertisers want to run more of a display ads that they are running in other platforms as opposed to more engaging video ads that you guys tend to prefer. And then what are those video ads that need to be custom created as opposed to the advertisers are just looking for more and different measurement that you don\u2019t offer. Thanks. ", "Imran Khan", "On the measurement side, I think we made quite a bit of progress. I think vast majority of advertising -- significant portion of advertising that happens on a platform and the big dollar that people spend, there is a measurement attached to it. So, I think advertisers are seeing good ROI from that. I gave quite a few examples that Nelson Catalina or [Newster], the kind of ROI that advertisers are seeing from our platform. ", "We now have more than 15 different third-party partners that we\u2019re partnering with on our platform to providing transparency to our advertisers, we're incredibly committed to provide transparency and I think the kind of results that advertisers seeing on our platform, we want to celebrate them and we want to share that with other advertisers. Can you repeat your first question please?", "Evan Spiegel", "I can take that as it pertains to the creative, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a barrier at all for big brands, I think people are seeing the value of full screen vertical video, it's pretty obvious across the industry. I think the barrier is definitely more of an issue for small businesses and direct response which is why we created the Snap publisher tool that we just released. It's pretty fun to play with, if you want to check it out but you can see how easy it is to create vertical video from all of your existing assets. So, I think that will be really important part of on-boarding more advertisers. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield ", "I've got two questions for Evan. Evan on your first investor call and actually Imran have just mentioned it earlier as well. You have both spoken about how others use growth hacking to inflate DAUs and how it really hurts the platform's relationship with users yet we definitely over the past quarter began to see push notifications from Snapchat essentially alerting us to one of our friends or one of our connections has published a story would you like to go and see it. Wondering despite Imran\u2019s comments earlier, has your philosophy on growth hacking begun to change? ", "And then two, time spent on Snapchat and Instagram based on the recent comments from Instagram it seems like it's fairly similar, but there is a very -- and my sense is there is very little direct messaging that happens on Instagram implying that most of their time spent is actually content consumption. When you think about Snapchat's 30 minutes of usage per day how much of that is actually stories including Discover versus basically communications? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, on the first question we've been sending notification like that for stories for friends since 2014 so I'm not sure why you are just seeing that now. ", "On the time spent I think time spent is definitely an interesting metric because unlike daily active time spent is zero sum. So for us in Q2 we saw over 40 minutes spent per day for users under 25 and over 20 minutes per day per user over 25 so I think that\u2019s some strong growth for us on the time spent side. ", "We don\u2019t breakout stories versus communications but I think the important thing is we've done a very good job innovating around monetizing communication I think historically that's been challenging for folks so we're really excited about the way we've monetized communication with our creative tools.", "Richard Greenfield", "So maybe just to be clear what exactly is the growth hacking that others do? If you send me push notifications, it's not growth hacking. What are others doing that you consider to be growth hacking and not real DAU growth?", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, I think there are plenty of examples online if you want to go for a Google, but I think the most important thing for us is that when we are telling you about content on a service that is really highly relevant to you and from your very close friends and I think if people as they become more reliant on push notifications to sort of relax the standards there and I think it's important for our business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. ", "Mark Mahaney ", "I\u2019ll still limit myself to one question. Evan you talked about probably not seeing a meaningful impact from these Android innovations changes until the second quarter of next year.", "What is the meaningful impact mean. I think for investors they love to see some sort of inflection up in the rest of world DAUs and maybe that was handicapped by the Android problems over the last year. So is that what we should see? Was that what you meant by a meaningful impact or just describe what you meant? Thanks a lot. ", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, so I think for us meaningful impact -- we definitely look at engagement, we would really like Android users more engage. I think a lot of that is focused on the camera functionality, it's really tough across all the different camera hardware and all these different phones and the different camera APIs, so we really like to see that improve and that's takes a lot of work, obviously because our service is still focused on creation that's something that's really important.", "And I think just because you mentioned the rest of the world DAU I want to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about that because I do think that the market continues to focus on daily active users as a proxy metric for revenue opportunity which is why we always encourage folks to look at the ARPU numbers in our industry across different geos. ", "So just for some examples, looking at other folks in the industry mobile and advertising business as a comp. We have to add more than 10 million daily active users in the rest of world for everyone 1 million daily active users in U.S. and Canada in order to make the same amount of money. So obviously with 10 times of number of users we also incur 10 times the cost, the hosting cost to make the same amount of money. So that would impact the cash flow profile of our business. ", "I think in a way that\u2019s just not a feeling this stage of our business, so I think we look down the road a little bit over the next five to 10 years many of the market but today with those challenges the structure of our business will become more appealing as the more wide markets develop, mobile devices improve and reach parity and faster connectivity becomes cheap and hopefully ubiquitous. So, at that point we'll necessarily focus our growth efforts outside of the core market. ", "I believe that Snapchat is one of our six platforms with over 150 million daily actives outside of China and the other five or so platforms grown by two companies with an aggregate market cap in excess of $1 trillion. So, the reason I say this is to illustrate that we've always been last to market competing against giant companies and we've historically been able to grow our business in markets that are highly competitive and saturated by our competitors because we're so focused on innovation. ", "And so, I think that explains why we are willing take this wait and see approach in markets like the rest of the world that don\u2019t make financial sense for our business at this point, but may make sense in the future. And so, we will continue to reevaluate our opportunities there and keep you posted. ", "Operator", "This concludes our question and answer session as well as today's conference. We thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect. "]}

Thank you very much.", "Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today.

This information can also be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures.

Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hello everyone and welcome to the call. Our business really came together towards the end of last year and I am very proud of our team for working hard to deliver these results. We executed well on our 2017 plan to improve quality, performance, and automation, which removed friction from our advertising business and improved our application for the Snapchat community. This translated into annual revenues that grew 104% from the prior year, and 8.9 million Daily Active Users added in the fourth quarter, the highest number of quarterly net adds since the third quarter of 2016.", "All this growth came at a lower cost than the previous quarter. Cash burn decreased 49% from the prior quarter, and gross margin increased 1,400 points sequentially to 36%. These are big improvements that show how quickly Snap can scale when our products and our ad business are working well together. In 2017, we focused on removing friction from our products, our advertising business, and our team. Last year, we talked a lot about our investments in Android and the importance of improving our Android application. Our community has benefited significantly from the changes we have made throughout 2017, and we\u2019re excited to see the impact of this hard work reflected in our Daily Active User growth.", "The retention rate of new Android users increased by nearly 20% when compared to last year, meaning that the people who try Snapchat on Android are much more likely to stick around and become Daily Active Users. Additionally, the fourth quarter saw significantly more new Android users as a percentage of net additional users than any other quarter in our history. It wasn\u2019t just Android that grew because of our efforts. Our growth on iOS continues, and we were honored and excited to end the year with Bitmoji and Snapchat as the number one and number two most popular apps of 2017 in the Apple App Store. Our advertising business changed profoundly over the past year as we migrated the sale of our Snap Ads to an automated auction. Over 90% of Snap Ads were bought programmatically during Q4, which means that the auction transition for Snap Ads is largely behind us. We are learning a lot while operating our automated advertising platform and we are constantly improving the way we sell and serve advertising.", "In Q4, our effective price per impression decreased by 25% while our total advertising revenue grew 38% sequentially. More importantly, we increased advertising impressions by over four times year-over-year while continuing to grow per-user engagement. This demonstrates that our platform can deliver value and efficiency at scale for our advertisers. Over the past two years, we hired over 2,400 people, roughly 100 new team members every month. While it was critical to build our team to keep pace with the growth of our business, it has become clear that we can now unlock substantially more productivity simply by changing the way that we work and by continuing to build an inclusive and creative culture.", "As such, we plan to moderate the growth of our team over the next year and focus on making sure that we have the right team, leadership, and organizational practices in place to support our culture and our mission. We are determined to have a close-knit, hardworking team that is brimming with positive energy and we will continue to make the necessary changes to ensure that everyone at our company is aligned with our values. We ended 2017 confident that we can grow our Snapchat community and monetize our products more efficiently than ever before. With our plans for user growth, augmented reality, and content in 2018, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. We\u2019re going to keep up the hard work and stay focused on the big opportunities ahead.", "Improving application performance is just the beginning when it comes to removing friction so that our community can grow and enjoy Snapchat. We have recently launched partnerships with wireless carriers in over a dozen markets to begin reducing cellular bandwidth costs for Snapchatters around the world. We have seen that when data is less expensive, more people are willing to use our data-intensive products. This is important because Snapchat can be more fun to use out in the world rather than at home on WiFi. We feel strongly that Snapchat should not be confined to our mobile application, the amazing Snaps created by our community deserve wider distribution so they can be enjoyed by everyone.", "We recently rolled out Stories Everywhere, so that the whole world can easily view Stories on the web. We\u2019ve also started bringing Snaps to bigger screens like stadium jumbotrons at this year\u2019s Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl. Removing friction from the way people use Snapchat and view Snaps will help us continue to grow our community over the coming year. One of the things that makes Snapchat so unique is our Camera and how frequently it is used by our community. This is different from many other services where content is uploaded from other sources rather than created in-app.", "Today, 97% of all the Snaps sent on Snapchat are created using our Camera. With billions of Snaps created every day, we have a unique opportunity to engage our community with augmented reality experiences overlaid on our Camera. Every week, on average, more than half of the entire 13 to 34-year-old population of the United States plays with augmented reality Lenses in Snapchat. We recently expanded our Lenses product with the release of Lens Studio, a set of desktop creative tools that make it easy for anyone to create their own augmented reality experiences and distribute them using Snapchat.", "In just six weeks from launch, over 30,000 Lenses were created by our community and viewed over one billion times. We are blown away by the ingenuity of our community and we can\u2019t wait to see what they create next. We\u2019ll be working hard to expand Lens Studio for years to come. Our content partners continue to shine on Snapchat, and we\u2019re seeing great traction around our new Shows format. In the fourth quarter, more 13 to 34-year-old U.S. viewers watched an average episode of Face Forward by E! on Snapchat than many of the most popular television shows during the same period. Our sports coverage continues to expand, and this season we entertained more than 30 million football fans in the United States with over 400 NFL Stories.", "We\u2019ve built our content business on the belief that sustainable partnerships benefit everyone involved: our partners, our community, and our company. This year we generated over $100 million in revenue for our content partners and we\u2019re excited to deepen these relationships over the coming years. In addition to our ongoing efforts in user growth, augmented reality, and content, we believe that the redesign of our application that we announced on our last call will provide a strong foundation for the evolution of our business.", "That\u2019s because our redesign separates social from media, solving many of the problems that arise when friends are commingled with professional content creators. While we are still very early in the rollout, we are optimistic about the potential to unlock additional growth with the redesign of our application. As expected, it will take time for our community to get used to the changes, but overall, we are pleased with the initial results and will be making the redesign available to our entire community in Q1. There is a lot of work ahead as we optimize the updated application, but our early observations support the thesis behind the new architecture and the many growth opportunities that it provides.", "For example, in one of our first test markets, we saw that the number of Daily Active Users watching Publisher Stories on Discover grew by over 40% when compared to the old design of the application. We also saw gains in ad performance, both in terms of view time and engagement, as well as an overall increase in our Average Revenue Per User when compared to the prior design.", "Additionally, we believe that the redesign has also made our application simpler and easier to use, especially for older users. Compared to the old design, core metrics around content consumption and time spent in the redesigned application are disproportionately higher for users over the age of 35, which bodes well for increasing engagement among older users as we continue to grow our business.", "Our design and engineering teams are constantly monitoring the rollout of the redesign and making improvements based on what we learn from our community and their usage of Snapchat. These adjustments to our products will continue over the next few quarters as we continue to optimize the application.", "Our work during 2017 is proof that we aren\u2019t afraid to make big changes for the long-term success of our business. We redesigned the Snapchat application, transitioned our Snap Ad business to an auction model, and made changes to our team to improve productivity and collaboration. We enter 2018 energized by the opportunities in front of us and excited to deliver against our plan for user growth, augmented reality, and content.", "I\u2019ll now hand over the call to Imran for a discussion of our business results.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi everyone. We had a great fourth quarter. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and 38% quarter-over-quarter. The investments we have made across our advertising business are starting to pay off, and we are pleased with the results we have seen so far. We remained focused on three key areas throughout the year, and I would like to provide an update on each area.", "One, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. First, enhancing our ad product suite. We want to offer ad products that are valuable to all advertisers. This means developing and refining solutions that solve a wide variety of business objectives. Not only does this allow us to serve more advertisers, it also helps us become a one-stop shop for those that continue to invest in our platform.", "Our strategy is paying off. For example, of the Top 100 Ad Age Advertisers that started advertising with us in Q1 of 2016 or earlier, each one of them, at a parent level, also spent with us in 2017 and over 90% of them spent in every quarter of 2017. In Q4, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Story. Our advertising partners have told us that they want a way to spend more time with their audiences. Promoted Story allows brands to take advantage of the familiar stories format that we invented four years ago. It\u2019s been just over a month since launch, and we have seen some amazing Stories from advertisers such as State Farm, Dominos, T-Mobile, and American Express. More importantly, our community is embracing our new format. On average, users that chose to watch Promoted Stories viewed them for over 10 seconds. In the coming weeks, we plan to make this format available in our self-service tools, making it the first Story Ad unit buyable within the Snap Ads auction platform.", "We have also seen strong growth in our direct-response business. In April of last year, we launched the ability to bid for installs in our self-service tools. This allowed advertisers to optimize campaigns for users most likely to install their app. Our ongoing investment in machine learning and our commitment to improving efficiency for advertisers is paying off. We drove 15 times more app installs in December compared to April, while continuing to drive increased return on investment. As we doubled our total revenue from app-install campaigns since the beginning of Q4, we also significantly decreased Cost per Installs for our advertisers.", "One great example of our progress on the direct-response front is Etermax, the creators of the mobile trivia game, Trivia Crack. Using our app-install ads, they were able to acquire high-value, highly engaged users at scale. They saw that Snapchat users were 25% more likely to still play the game after a week, compared to users from other platforms. And overall Snapchat users played the game for twice as long as users acquired anywhere else. Importantly, they were able to achieve these results at a Cost Per Signup and Cost Per Install that was 20% lower than other channels.", "The second area of focus is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We know that in order to truly scale our business, advertising on Snapchat has to be really easy. As Evan mentioned, in Q4, over 90% of Snap Ad impressions were delivered programmatically. In Q4 of 2016, this number was under 10%, so we\u2019re really happy about how quickly our advertisers have embraced this transition and continue to do so. In fact, the number of advertisers spending in the auction doubled quarter-over-quarter.", "We\u2019re also really excited that these self-service tools have allowed us to reach different types of advertisers, not just big brands. Revenue from small and medium-sized businesses more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. For the first time, revenue in Q4 from advertisers outside of Ad Age\u2019s Top 100 exceeded revenue from the Top 100 Advertisers.", "The Penny Hoarder is a great example of an SMB that is growing their business on Snapchat. The Penny Hoarder is a website dedicated to personal finance tips. They came to Snapchat with the goal of finding a new audience that couldn't be reached on other platforms. In just a few months\u2019 time, their Snap Ads campaigns generated 40% higher returns than other platforms and drove a 51% increase in their revenue. We're thrilled by the results they have seen.", "Our self-service tools have also enabled us to quickly scale in international markets. For example, in the Middle East, we made the strategic decision to rely exclusively on our selfserve tools for Snap Ads. Starting on October 1, Snap Ads could only be purchased through Ad Manager, and this decision quickly paid off. In three months, we more than tripled the number of advertisers spending in our auction, and out of all our international offices, this region was our top contributor to overall revenue growth in Q4.", "Still, we have a lot of opportunity to make it even easier for advertisers. Snap Publisher, a web tool for vertical video creation, was a great milestone on the Snap Ads front, and most recently, we took a big step in helping brands with augmented reality. As Evan mentioned, we launched Lens Studio less than two months ago to make it easier for our community and our advertisers to create Lenses. Foot Locker was our first advertiser to leverage Lens Studio to create a Sponsored Lens. They worked with our Lens Studio partner, North Kingdom, on a Lens that was incredibly successful and highly engaging. On average, users played with their Lens for 45 seconds!", "Lastly, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. In Q4, we made a lot of good progress with Snap Pixel. We focused on scaling its usage as well as building out its capabilities. In just two months since its launch, some of the most visited websites have installed the Pixel across thousands of domains. Many of these advertisers were previously not spending with us until we had stronger first-party measurement solutions. One out of every three advertisers that participated in the Q4 Pixel beta spent their first dollar on Snap after they got access to the Pixel.", "The Pixel is helping us to unlock dollars, especially from performance budgets. We think this will continue as we build out additional capabilities, such as dynamic custom audiences, conversion optimization, and secondary objective optimization. We also rolled out Pixel Custom Audiences in December, which allows advertisers to reach audiences based on actions such as visiting their site. It is very early but we\u2019re seeing good results. We still have a lot of work to do here but we\u2019re excited about what this can do, mostly for our midmarket and SMB customers.", "Our focus on online to offline measurement throughout the year helped us capitalize on the holiday season. We know Q4 is a critical time for many of our advertisers, especially retailers, and they want their campaigns to drive store visits and sales. Target partnered with us, using Snap Ads and Filters, to drive action intent and in-store visitation for holiday shopping. We drove a 16 percentage-point lift in action intent to shop at Target for the holidays as measured by Nielsen, as well as over 660,000 incremental visitors to their stores as measured by Snap to Store, which is our proprietary solution that measures foot traffic in stores.", "We continue to invest in our measurement ecosystem and now have 19 third-party measurement partners. In Q4, we partnered with the National Research Group, a leading data provider in the movie industry, to understand the impact that our ad campaigns have on opening weekend box office. Our ongoing partnership demonstrates that Snapchatters represent 36% of moviegoers and 50% of ticket sales.", "Additionally, movies that advertise on Snapchat are 22% more likely to be moviegoers\u2019 first choice in theaters on the opening weekend, a metric that is highly correlated to opening weekend box office. We\u2019re really happy with the progress we made in 2017. We still have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re excited to keep the momentum going.", "Thank you for the time today, and here\u2019s Drew to discuss our financial results.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon everyone. Simply put, our fourth quarter results represented a major step forward for Snap, both financially and operationally. Overall, we saw improvements across our business, but I will comment on four specific areas of interest for Q4.", "First, revenues increased 72% year-over-year and 37% sequentially, anchored by growing auction traction and holiday brand sales. Revenues for the year more than doubled, up 104%. Second, gross margin expanded substantially, which continues to validate that our business model can scale profitably. As Evan noted, gross margins were 36%, improving over 2,700 basis points year-over-year and up 1,400 basis points in just one quarter.", "Third, headcount growth continues to moderate, thanks to productivity gains from our team. Net additions in the quarter were slightly more than 100, one-third of the rate of recent quarters. And fourth, cash burn declined 49% sequentially, driven by more focused capital deployment priorities and thoughtful cash management.", "I will now expand on each. First, global revenues grew to $286 million in the fourth quarter. We saw growth in every region, and international markets now represent 23% of our total revenue, up from 12% a year ago and 20% last quarter.", "As expected, the fastest growing product in Q4 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold through the auction. Many of the auction dynamics were consistent with prior quarters, although ad volumes were much higher in Q4. It was very encouraging to see some substantial daily sales volumes flowing through the auction during the quarter.", "As expected, revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing, which fell sequentially due to the mix shift from managed to programmatic and reserved to bidded ads.", "Let me share some numbers with you on impressions and pricing. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Promoted Stories, were up 90% sequentially and up over 575% year-over-year. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Promoted Stories, was down more than 15% sequentially, and nearly 70% year-over-year.", "Third, we ended the quarter with over 90% of our ads served programmatically, up from 80% in the prior quarter. Over the medium term, we believe that increasing our advertiser count will have a positive impact on our pricing. In the quarter, we saw the percentage of contested auctions increase versus the prior quarter, and auctions that were contested continued to have higher prices than single-bidded auctions.", "Now, looking at our key cost drivers, we are excited to continue to see our economic model gaining traction: growing revenues coupled with banded user expenses fueled gross margin expansion again in Q4.", "Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures including gross margins, they will exclude stock based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "The cost leverage we are seeing is particularly apparent on a per user basis. In Q4, our ARPU increased 46% year-over-year to $1.53, while our costs per user, or CoRPU, only increased 2%, to $0.98. We\u2019ve been able to moderate user cost growth through the successful execution of our multi cloud strategy. Specifically, hosting costs per user dropped from $0.72 a year ago to $0.70 in the quarter. That's great progress in a year when our sales have more than doubled and engagement metrics have grown substantially.", "As a result, worldwide gross margins expanded to 36%. Internal analyses continue to suggest our economic model can scale well as North American gross margins are well above the worldwide average, driven by their higher ARPU, which was $2.75 in the quarter.", "Now moving down the income statement, the primary driver for operating expenses remains people cost. In the quarter, our hiring pace slowed substantially. Specifically, net adds were slightly more than 100, as we started to lever our significant early investments in people.", "Hiring mix remains a priority, and the absolute number of back-office employees declined in Q4. Overall operating expenses were up 17% sequentially, driven by modest hiring, increased sales commissions, legal costs, and year-end expenses.", "Lastly, we focused on capital deployment priorities and thoughtfully managed our cash position this quarter. CapEx remained modest at $21 million and less than $85 million for the year, driven by our capital light infrastructure strategy. Our CapEx per user for the year was less than $0.50, which we believe leads the industry.", "M&A was modest in the quarter, and we adopted a sell-to-cover approach for vested restricted stock units for employees during the quarter, which substantially reduced our cash spend. As a result, we were able to reduce our cash burn by 49% sequentially. We ended 2017 with $2 billion in cash and marketable securities.", "As of December 31, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1,222 million and 1,420 million on a fully diluted basis. Q4 represented a significant step forward for Snap on the key financial metrics. As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to manage our business for the long term. In 2018, there is much to do and we are focused to deliver on our key priorities.", "I want to share some financial thoughts with you for the early part of the year. First, as we think about revenue growth in Q1 2018, we start with the current momentum in the business. Specifically, we saw strong growth in Q4, and our year-over-year advertising revenue growth rate accelerated to 74%. In Q1, we are planning for our year-over-year revenue growth rate to moderate from the Q4 pace. The majority of our revenue is generated through brand advertising, which seasonally peaks in the fourth quarter.", "Additionally, we are planning for the transition of the creative tools business to the programmatic platform, which we believe will drive additional impressions at lower prices and result in more modest growth in the first half of 2018. Also note that in Q1 2017, we had $8 million of Spectacles revenue which we are planning to be substantially down year-over-year and sequentially.", "On hosting expenses, we exited the fourth quarter with a slightly higher cost per DAU than the quarterly average of $0.70. The cost impact of our application redesign has yet to be fully determined. That said, we are focused on executing additional cost saving initiatives in 2018 to continue to offset future cost increases.", "With respect to operating expenses, we are planning for continued gains in team productivity and modest hiring. We are planning for operating-expense growth to moderate in the first half of 2018 and be up low double digits versus the second half of 2017, primarily driven by more focused hiring in front-of-house functions.", "Please note that this does not include any potential acquisitions. Capital expenditures were less than $85 million in 2017, and we are planning for a slight increase in 2018. We are moving many of our headquarter teams to a series of leased facilities in Santa Monica during the first half of the year, although we do expect additional moves to occur later in the year and into 2019 as well.", "With that, I will now turn the line back to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, after your initial question is asked your line will be muted. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.", "And our first question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler", "Great, thanks. Just two questions. One for Evan and one for Imran. Evan you mentioned that Android retention is up 20% quarter-on-quarter. Can you just give us some color on what\u2019s driving that? And then you also said that engagement in the older cohorts and with \u2013 and with discover is up pretty big following the redesign. So how does the engagement Snaps compare with younger cohorts versus the older cohorts?", "And then second question for Imran, we saw some news in the upfront that you guys have secured as much as $70 million in ad revenue for the winter Olympics. So can you just talk about how much of that of flow through Snap and how that kind of triangulates with the comments about the first quarter? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Ross. Yeah, I think in my comments earlier I talked about a year-over-year increase in retention. We have been working very hard to provide more value to our users when they sign-up and one of the key ways that we do this is try to make sure that they have a lot of great friends ready for them. So we rolled out quick out over this year, and that\u2019s made a huge difference on making sure that folks who sign up, get the friends they need quickly. I can\u2019t provide any detail on cohorts but we\u2019re excited with the progress we have been making on Android.", "Imran Khan", "So on the Olympic side, Ross, let me jump on that one. So we are very excited to have a special event like the winter Olympics. And we believe Snap, the community will really enjoy what we have there. We\u2019re excited to be the biggest mobile partner there. Obviously, it\u2019s an extension of a success or strong overall partnership we have with NBCUniversal and it builds on the success that we had with the summer Olympics back in 2016.", "So as our business is growing, we look to these tentpole events as engagement drivers and when we do financial drivers. And so our core business today is much bigger than it was back in the summer of 2016. Now we have been working with advertisers and our ad packages have sold well, so we do expect modest revenue tailwind in Q1. But overall percentage revenue boost to our sales base we expect to be less than what it was a couple of years ago when we had a smaller business.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.", "Stephen Ju", "Okay, thanks. Imran, I recall you were saying, I think it was two quarters ago that you\u2019re looking to evangelize the platform and lowering advertisers or cheaper price inventory. You have touched on this to some degree on the prepared remarks, but \u2013 around the Pixel, but how are the conversations going now? Do you still feel like you have to sell the benefits of advertising of Snap especially for the DR guys? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think, the conversation is going really well as evident by our Q4 result. And I think a couple of things happening. Number one, we are really offering very attractive value to our advertisers on our platform given our size and scale and you are seeing that more and more advertisers are coming to our platform and number of advertisers and auction doubled in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. The second thing is on a direct response side, we are seeing great success on app install and lead generation and we are aggressively moving into e-commerce customers with the launch of Pixel and early trend looks really good and we are really excited about that.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Justin Post", "Great, nice revenue quarter. A couple of questions for you. Maybe Imran, the ad impressions were up 575%. Is that all just demand generated or did the company make a decision to open up more ad impressions this year? And how much \u2013 do you just feel like you have tremendous rooms still to grow there? And then maybe a question for Drew, you have on that a little bit. But was there any just unusual item in the fourth quarter as far as revenues that we should be thinking about that that might not sustained into next year? Thank you.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah, with 170 million \u2013 187 million daily active users who are incredibly engaged. We have a lot of inventory on our platform and we think there are still a lot of room for us to grow.", "Drew Vollero", "So, and Justin \u2013 hey, it\u2019s Drew. On the revenue side of the world, we did try to call out a couple of those in my comments. We are a brand business and we do believe that the brand business seasonally peaks in the fourth quarter. So that was something we wanted to highlight as you think about the early part of the year. Also as you think about the early part of the year, our spectacles business was $8 million last year in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect that business to annualize or even sequentially comp to where it has been.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark Mahaney", "I want to try to get at the question of the sustainability of two trends, the DAU trends and the revenue growth trends. And I guess I would like to ask it in \u2013 in the first in the DAU trends in terms of the how far you think you are along in terms of kind of \u201cfixing the Android of problems\u201d or the crash where are the crash levels were versus where you have had them before? I know in the past you talked about having that all finalized by Q2 of this you. Do you think you are already there? So is there any more you need to do with Android in order to get that experience like you wanted?", "And then on the revenue side, I guess the one thing I\u2019d add there is it sounds like you\u2019re already through all of the auctions \u2013 the transition to the auction process. So I would think that this kind of growth rates that we\u2019re seeing leaving aside seasonality is relatively sustainable. But anything else you would want to do to caution us on extrapolating the growth from here other than the seasonality and the spectacles?", "Evan Spiegel", "So on the DAU side; obviously we talked a lot in 2017 about Android and how much we have focused on it. And today we have some of the lowest ever crash rates that we have seen, but we\u2019re still going to be doing a lot of work to rebuild the Android application. There are components of that in the updated discover functionality and it\u2019s rolling out in the redesign and so that\u2019s great to see. The frame dropping has gone away. The scroll performance is awesome and streaming is making huge difference for people who are watching content of our service. So I think that\u2019s a great step in the right direction, especially with the resign, but you will see a lot more this year and we have been chopping a lot of word on that for a long-time as you know.", "Drew Vollero", "It\u2019s Drew here. Hey a couple of thoughts for you on the overall business, Mark. So in terms of the revenue growth drivers, we didn\u2019t talk about the seasonality, we talked about the spectacles, spectacle as a smaller piece. Overall, the way that you should think about the business is really that the engine that drove the growth in the fourth quarter will continue to drive our growth really is the option platform that\u2019s really where things are heading. There is a smaller piece of our business on the creative tools side. We will be transitioning that in the first half of the year as we transition that we do expect to see gains and impression offset by declines in prices, but really sort of as you are thinking about big picture ideas and where our business is going, what\u2019s the business drivers are, it really is going to be Snap Ads and the auction for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Heath Terry", "Great, thanks. Evan, how do you experienced with the redesign impact in a way that you\u2019re planning product development? Where and how has it impacted your priorities? And then Drew just a quick one. Given the progress on cash burn, how should we be thinking about your trajectory there going forward?", "Evan Spiegel", "We decoupled the redesign from a lot of the feature development that we have been working on, so that\u2019s continued and I am very excited about the product pipeline for this year. The redesign is really focused on three things. We want to make the app easier to use. We want to bring your friends together and we want to elevate a lot of the great content that we have and discover. And so far I think we have accomplished all three and we have tried to be very deliberate. In the rollout, we have learned a lot as we have rolled it out. It's out now about 40 million folks and we\u2019re excited on the progress there. So we will be working on a lot of that throughout the year and for the years to come, but that\u2019s decoupled from the feature development process internally.", "Drew Vollero", "And Heath on the working capital or just general of the cash burn of the business, obviously big picture cash is very important to us, liquidity is something that we look at all the time. If you think about sort of the uses of cash for the business, we\u2019re EBITDA negative and investments in business operations continue to be our number one capital deployment priority. Our second capital deployment priorities, M&A, it\u2019s opportunistic as you know. So sometimes we do stuffs, sometimes we don\u2019t. I do think we can do a better job of thinking about cash versus stock mix as we do that. But I think we\u2019re still in the M&A game and we will be periodically looking at deals. I do think the big change we made between the third and fourth quarter was really we stopped buying back employee shares here in the fourth quarter and that was a big piece of what the change in cash burn was.", "I also think we did a better job of managing our working capital within the balance sheet and that\u2019s just the maturing business getting better than what it does. So, overall, it\u2019s really going to be the investment in the business and the M&A our capital deployments and those are the primary uses of cash.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Hey, guys. Congrats on the solid results. This is actually Matt chiming in on Lloyd\u2019s behalf. The question, two questions, really, one with the Android developments, could you talk about where you saw the engagement increase? Was it pretty uniform across your geographies or are there any differences to call out there? And two for any advertisers, who might have been with you that have been since left?", "What were the key challenges that they faced? And have those challenges been addressed whether that\u2019s targeting ROIs like a measurability, maybe not finding the right demographic, any color there would be helpful.", "Evan Spiegel", "So with the advertiser strike I think we've made tremendous progress in delivering things that advertisers are looking for. We made tremendous progress on app install side, tremendous problem \u2013 progress on lead generation side and we also launched Pixel. And I think a lot of the advertisers, primary who were on the e-commerce segment are looking for Pixel to really understand how we are driving growth. And I think that's the one big area that we continue to invest.", "The other area is that we have continued to remain really focused to buying add on Snapchat absolutely easy. And we did make a lot of progress with Snap publishers and we are going to continue to do so and that will also continue to drive growth. But overall, we are very happy with the progress we made and going to continue to do so. And in terms of Android geography, we saw improvement across the geographies. So there\u2019s no one specific geographic to point that out.", "Operator", "The next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on the advertising. The way you guys break up the business in talking about it between managed, versus programmatic, to reserved, versus bided, is there any chance you can give us color about the skew in terms of percentage of revenue that tilts one way or the other? And also the differences in price between the two so we could get a better sense of where we are in the transition on the revenue base and on the pricing mix in the business? Thanks so much.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes with regards to breaking down revenue by channel, we don't do that. But I think one thing I believe Drew pointed out that programmatic was the fastest growing segment of the business as evident by the number of impression that is flowing through the programmatic business.", "With regards to pricing, I think, we really focus here to drive return on investment for advertisers. If we drive more return on investment for advertisers that means more advertisers will come to our platform. We're just getting started, there are 26 million small businesses out there, we want to capture a big chunk of that. So we are less focused on price, more focused on driving value and driving growth.", "But in general right even an advertiser wants to reserve a date that always have high price than bided pricing. So that's how usually it works.", "Operator", "And our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "John Blackledge", "Great, thank you. So the user growth was better than expected. I'm just wondering if you have any color on engagement, time spent on the platform, and how you think about kind of the key engagement drivers in 2018? And then just a quick one on the total number of advertisers on the platform. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't have any material updates for you on engagement, but I did see I yesterday Verizon releasing numbers about their customers\u2019 usage during the Super Bowl. And I guess last year we were number three in terms of overall usage during the Super Bowl and this year we were number one. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that directionally, but no specific updates for you today.", "Imran Khan", "In terms of the total number of advertisers on the platform, obviously it's a key accelerator for our business. We know when we get more competition on the auction we take it. So we\u2019re aware that we can drive pricing over the medium turn. We did double the number of advertisers on the platform, we're still a young business with a lot of room to grow, but we're excited by the progress in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Thanks for taking the question. I have two first for Drew or Imran, can you just help us understand how your longstanding kind of existing advertisers are behaving in a reserved media world versus auction just how their behavior is shifting And then secondly, Evan you talked a couple times about removing friction, what are the opportunities that you're thinking about in 2018 to continue doing that? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Hi, thanks Doug. I think if you look at the large advertisers, they have different buckets of budgets, right. So they have always on budget, they have activation budget surrounding some events like Super Bowl, they have new initiative budgets. And what we're trying to do is play into all of those buckets and trying to capture dollar. So with regards to always on budget that's the money we are getting on to our auction platform, to our self-service platform. But then we also have this incredible ad unit tools like lenses and filters that\u2019s really unique and no other platform has that at scale like us. And you can see that large advertisers take advantage of those products or take advantage of our premium products like for shows and discover to surrounding some events or deliver some message. They want to do that to as part of their premium content strategy. Like Super Bowl, I think, I don't know if you saw that, we had a couple of great lenses and that did really, really well. And we are really, really excited about that.", "Drew Vollero", "On the removing friction mandate over here, I think, one of the key things is all of the new processes we have around quality and performance that will continue to make a big difference for us and were obviously a big focus of last year. But also we have some major architectural changes coming to both IOS and android, coming throughout the year and we're excited about the opportunities there.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Thanks. I have two. I think the first for Drew and then the next one Evan. Getting back to the question a lot of people have asked around the outlook for Q1 revenue we can obviously kind of back out spectacle impact. And brand I guess is seasonal like you said, so it should be \u2013 the seasonality should have reflected in the year ago. So I guess I'm just trying to understand coming off of a strong Q4 with accelerating trends the auction dynamics, et cetera that are benefiting you. Why would you \u2013 what is sort of driver of the \u201cmoderating growth\u201d in Q1? It seems like you've got some nice tailwinds on a year-on-year basis, ex Spectacles, going into Q1.", "And then for Evan there have been some other players, some other social apps in the space that have kind of admitted that some of the ways that their users are using their apps may not always be deemed good uses of time, right more around focusing going for more on quality versus quantity. I wonder if that's something that you think is in any parts of SnapChat an issue and anything that you're sort of addressing from that perspective? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So let me comment on the first question. So we did comment on the underlying drivers for the spike up that we did see in the fourth quarter. And we did share we\u2019re thinking internally about the Q1 dynamics. The largest piece of our revenue for our business in Q4 remains brand sales. And we believe brand revenue seasonally peaks in Q4. And so as the business now has more scale, we believe year-over-year growth rates are probably the most relevant way to think about our business. We think it neutralizes the brand seasonality and it's frankly our team thinks about managing its business.", "So we're thinking about that a year-over-year growth rate and that's why I try to target that 74%, so you get a sense on that. But what we did try to do was point out some of that underlying drivers, the seasonality, the change in some of the creative that we moved to self-serve and then a little bit which is a smaller piece of the business on the spectacle side. So we try to give you some thoughts. Those are the big movers if you think about our business in the first quarter.", "And on the product side from the beginning we've been really thoughtful about how we approach these issues, it's one of the reasons why we've never had public facing metrics around followers or likes and why we've always tried to control the distributes content very widely on our platform.", "And I think if you look at the redesign the evolution with the redesign, what we're trying to say is that there's a really big difference between talking to your friends on the telephone and broadcasting on a TV channel. And I think our society has noticed that difference for a really long time and that's why there's different regulations and rules around communicating with your friends and broadcasting media. And so for us, as we evolve the product, I think this allows us to really reinforce the great things about our communications product, bring friends closer together and at the same time provide more distribution to really high quality content.", "So I think we're trying to stay way ahead of the curve on this stuff and it\u2019s the thing we care a lot about.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Jason Helfstein", "Thanks, two questions. So you did share a good amount of learnings on the app redesign. Are you getting input from advertisers and agencies? So kind of how deep is the learnings going? And then it does seem like brand will be a lower percent of the mix going forward between brand, DR and then large versus small advertisers. So if any thoughts about how to think about the mix of advertisers going forward and kind of the benefits of greater diversification, thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, we are taking a feedback from advertisers and advertisers and agencies, a perfect example of Promoted Stories. Agencies and advertisers always told us that they wanted a new way to tell their stories, and that's why we launched Promoted Stories and we're thrilled with the success we are seeing and really, really excited about the opportunity.", "The second question was around mix shift between brand and DR. I think for the first time in Company\u2019s history more than 50% of our revenue came from advertisers who were outside the Ad Age Top 100. As we said there are 26 million or so large and small businesses out there and there's a tremendous opportunity to help those advertisers to be successful and they are looking for ways to reach new users and we can help them. And so we really dedicated to focus \u2013 as we do that, you will see that the mix will change and that will also muted seasonality in the business hopefully in the long term.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Youssef Squali", "All right. Two questions, please. Starting with Drew, on the cost side, can you shed some more light into the strength in the gross margin, components of that and more importantly, as we look into 2018, it looks like 2017 had a lot of noise to it from a gross margin side. How should we be thinking about the seasonality on that line? And then Evan, GDPR requires changes to the consent recommendation is around kids 16 and under, I know, international is a relatively small percentage of the overall business. But how do you envision this effect in Snap\u2019s on boarding process and just any other potential fallout from GDPR or not? Thanks.", "Drew Vollero", "So let me speak to some of the wins that are happening on gross margin, you\u2019re right. Gross margins have been expanding here and been expanding for a while, we did have a terrific quarter, gross margins went from 21% sequentially up to 36% and a similar expansion on a year-over-year basis. Really it\u2019s \u2013 we have a powerful model when we can get incremental sales here. And so if you think about the marginal cost to serve here, it\u2019s not high. And so simply put, sales have been growing a lot faster than within our costs on a variable side, which has been terrific.", "Our cost structure really on the variable side as infrastructure costs and rev share both of which were been heading in the right direction. Our infrastructure costs are down $0.72 last year to $0.70, we\u2019re just doing an excellent job of executing on a multi-cloud strategy, we\u2019re winning there. And obviously, we\u2019re taking the capital out of the business as we deal with so that\u2019s really two wins that we\u2019ve been executing on the infrastructure side.", "On the rev share side, as we continue to open up more owned inventory that those incremental sales dollars come without a rev share. So that\u2019s really been helping manage down the revenue share percentages, it was 14% of sales last year, now it\u2019s 10% and we\u2019ve seen good leverage on that all along. So really it\u2019s a powerful combination of growing revenues and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of flattening the costs in marginal cost. And so you\u2019ve seen the expansion of the gross margin over the last six quarters, it\u2019s been nice progress.", "Evan Spiegel", "On the GDPR front something that we are ready for and we\u2019ve been very thoughtful about how we approach privacy in our product. Obviously, things like the right to be forgotten are close to our heart. It's something that we have a very serious focus on.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one for Evan. Evan, you were talking about kind of the trying to stay a step ahead of everyone else, when you think about the product. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of questions from investors about the kind of the rational for the redesign and how much of it was something you saw that you didn\u2019t like and use your behavior or was it trying to meet advertiser demand? And it seems like you\u2019re trying to portray as, this was more of nothing was wrong, we just believe we can be better. I just want to \u2013 could you maybe just set the record straight to confirm that the rational driving the redesign.", "And then just a question for Imran and Drew. You obviously exceeded Wall Street expectations for Q4, but as you think forward for a full year 2018, I think, if you look back to the IPO expectations were for roughly $2 billion of revenue in 2018. That\u2019s now down to call it a $3 billion at least before today\u2019s call and while I know you don\u2019t give guidance. Wondering how you feel about the level of consensus out there in terms of ability for the company to meet or exceed the way you did in Q4?", "Evan Spiegel", "Hey, Rich. We\u2019re always trying to improve the product and we\u2019re pretty relentless about it. We see here huge amount of opportunity both in the redesign, but also all the other stuff. That we are working on and obviously, it\u2019s what we want to do. So we\u2019re really excited about our work there.", "Drew Vollero", "In terms of the overall thoughts for the year, Rich, and look the Snap Ad sold through the auction that are going to continue to be our main revenue driver in 2018. The auction continues to be new for us, where there\u2019s lots of optimizing going behind the scenes, every single day on pricing, on targeting et cetera. But there are a series of new technologies, enablers, accelerators like the Pixel by targeting improvements, new products. But they should be accelerated for our business, but it\u2019s difficult to predict when they\u2019re going to be ready. And so as a result, our revenue visibility is really more in the near-term. And so that\u2019s why we shared some thoughts with you as it relates to the first quarter on the underlying drivers of the business. And so that\u2019s the visibility that we have comfort with at this point. So that\u2019s why we share those thoughts.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Thanks. I think you guys got assist before maybe a couple quarters ago. I would think I\u2019ll add with the strength that you\u2019re seeing in self-serve and we thought about opening up the auction to third-party DSPs to increase the number of advertisers to get it\u2019s more pricing point be there platform. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think when you open it up to third-party DSP providers that are always a risk that some of the user ideas will leak our platform, and I think we have really, really focused on user privacy. And ultimately that\u2019s a very, very important part of it. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re interested in doing that. I think what\u2019s really makes great that \u2013 effort anybody can logon to our platform and buy advertisement. And there are a lot of advertisers, who are looking to acquire new customers and we do our strength in the millennials market, right, 70% of 13 to 34 in U.S., UK, France on those markets are on our platform. And so we\u2019re really excited that what we can offer and I think that\u2019s a great way to grow our business without compromising potential privacy issues.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Egbert with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "John Egbert", "Thanks. I had a couple questions on maps. I was wondering how maps fit into the redesign. Are you seeing increased used of maps and/or stories you didn\u2019t maps for the test users. That you\u2019re tracking. Is it a priority to make maps usage more friction less and redesign. And then on monetization on \u2013 it seems likes stories of reviewed from maps on the interface are still on monetize. There at least a very under monetized. Should we expect to see that change anytime soon or what type of criteria are you evaluating there? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "We\u2019re really excited about maps and we have over 100 million monthly active users from Maps. And we'll be working on improving the frequency with which people use that product, mostly by trying to provide more value around using the maps experience. Today, it\u2019s hard to know where to go, it\u2019s hard to navigate interesting things that are happening. And so as we improve the product, we will make it easier for you to find the most interesting things that happened on your map. So I think a lot of work to do there, of course, and we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re bubbling it up higher, obviously in the redesign. On monetization, we\u2019re not currently monetizing maps and nothing to share on that front.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask about international expansion, I think Imran and Evan you mentioned about working with carrier partners internationally, and then also selling ads through Snap Ads through Ad manager in newer markets like the Middle East. So just wanted understand, if there\u2019s maybe a little bit of change in strategy, in terms of focusing on the top ad markets globally or just looking at launching everywhere? And then in terms of moderating headcount, just really quick, if you could provide any sort of insight on reducing the friction or improving I think productivity gains \u2013 you mentioned back office employees declined, but is there any change in sales structure given the strength in the auction. Thank you.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think with as our business becoming more and more programmatic ourselves forces becoming a consultant to our clients. And I think that is very important, because I think, we have a still lot of work to do to educate the market. And really teach the market, how to create vertical video, audio that really works on mobile environment. Many of our advertising partners are really waiting by creating great ad content and really understanding how to take advantage of our platform. And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest on that and I think that\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for us to capture market share by doing so.", "With regards to international market, look I think international is a great opportunity more and more advertisers in the international market wants to use Snapchat to reach their audience and we continue to be aggressive drilling out of the market that we think we can generate profitable revenue growth.", "Evan Spiegel", "As I going to say Ron as we\u2019ve been building up to the 3,000 here, the north star really has been add to the front of house and leverage the back of the house as much as we can. To your point, we saw that in the back of the house for the fourth quarter, but we have been able to move the mix front of house with engineering in sales, it\u2019s now over 80% of the people at the company that\u2019s by design. And so really those remain our strategic priorities. We are going to be focusing hiring to your point as we move forward. But those remain high priorities for us.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s session. You may now disconnect."]}

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded.", "Thank you very much. Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2018, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2018 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today.

This information can be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures.

This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We began 2018 with several major Snapchat updates, and we continue to make progress in growing our advertising business and building tools for advertisers.", "This quarter, we rolled out the redesign of our application. This new design is driven by our fundamental belief that separating friends from professional content creators is important to both our mission and the long-term growth of our business.", "For example, we have known for a long time that creating public-facing content is a very different behavior from interacting with close friends, which makes it challenging for both to exist successfully in the same ecosystem. Before the redesign, Stories were sorted by recency, meaning that people who post most frequently were usually at the top of the list. Naturally, the most frequently-posting users tended to be people who create content as part of their job, compared to users who are just sharing their day with friends. As our community continued to grow, keeping friends and creators in the same feed made Snapchat feel less personal, because close friends were constantly buried below creators.", "We addressed these issues by separating friends from creators and by making it easier to find Stories from the people closest to you. Now personal friends no longer have to compete with creators, and people can find Stories based on the depth of their relationships rather than who is posting most often. We also built a new home for creators in a newly expanded Discover section. This enables us to properly invest in products, discovery, and monetization for our creators, while also supporting a larger variety of content on Snapchat. The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both.", "As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption, especially given the high frequency of daily engagement of our community. While we had an average of 191 million daily active users in Q1, our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average. We are already starting to see early signs of stabilization among our iOS users as people get used to the changes, but still have a lot of work to do to optimize the new design, especially for our Android users. Our time spent remained more than 30 minutes per day on average following the redesign, and we have also started to realize some of the positive benefits, including increased new user retention for older users.", "We are now focused on optimizing the redesign based on our ongoing experimentation and learning. For example, when we separated friends\u2019 Stories from creator Stories, we also moved them to the left side of the camera and merged them into the Chat feed. We learned that combining watching Stories and communicating with friends into the same place made it harder to optimize for both competing behaviors. We are currently rolling out an update to address this by sorting communication by recency and moving Stories from friends to the right side of the application, while maintaining the structural changes we have made around separating friends from creators and sorting friends\u2019 Stories by relationships. The redesign created a lot of new opportunities, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to refine and improve Snapchat.", "This overall process is indicative of how we approach product development at Snap. We start with a core belief that builds on our mission of empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. In this case, it is our long-standing belief that separating social interactions from media content encourages people to create and share Snaps with each other, while also providing better opportunities and incentives for media partners. We then build and optimize our products around these underlying values, prioritizing them over short-term growth. ", "While doing so can often lead our company to take bigger risks and endure the accompanying volatility, we do this for two reasons. First, we firmly believe that it\u2019s the right thing to do for our community, because it ensures that our various products maintain a cohesive vision and stay true to our mission. Second, starting from first principles often leads us to create novel and unexpected experiences, which naturally tend to be longer-term opportunities that are difficult to optimize based on short-term results. ", "For example, our focus on self-expression and living in the moment from the very beginning took a long time for people to understand and get used to, but over the years has helped Snapchat become one of the most-used cameras in the world, with more than 60% of our daily active users creating Snaps with our camera, even as we doubled our user base over the past 2.5 years. Furthermore, one of the great things about our software products is that we can modify and update them any time. This makes it easier for us to take these risks, knowing that we are constantly learning and optimizing our products to better achieve our mission over the long term.", "Android performance is still a weakness for us, but we are making significant progress. Given the volume of changes we made with the redesign, a number of performance regressions contributed to a disproportionately negative impact among Android users, and we are currently working on addressing them. While the investments we made in our performance automation systems have significantly improved the speed and scale at which we are able to identify and fix these kinds of issues, our legacy codebase remains a problem. ", "I\u2019m really excited about the new version of the Android application that I talked about last year, which has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to be lightweight, performant, and modular, which we hope will alleviate many of the performance-related issues we see with new product launches and updates. We have been testing the rebuilt application internally and we have quite a bit more work to do before our expected launch in Q3 of this year. In the meantime, we are incorporating some of the new modular components like Discover and the Friend Feed into the existing application, which we hope will improve performance in the near term.", "We continue to lead in mobile content and augmented reality, with a lot of progress in both this quarter. During the Winter Olympics, more than 81 million people watched our coverage on Discover in nine different languages, quickly surpassing the reach of our Rio Summer Olympics coverage. In the United States alone, over 10 million people on average tuned in every day at the Games. The redesign also enabled us to experiment with our first live streaming experience so that our users could watch key moments of the Olympics in real time wherever they were.", "Additionally, our content is starting to find its way outside of our application and into the world. During March Madness, Snaps submitted to Our Story appeared on stadium jumbotrons at each of the 67 games, as well as on local and national broadcast television coverage of the tournament. Over 200 media organizations have featured Snaps or embedded the Snap Map in their online, social, and broadcast television channels since we enabled the functionality just a few months ago. We believe that broadening the distribution of the unique Snaps created by our community will inspire more people to download Snapchat and create Snaps using our camera.", "We expanded our augmented reality platform and offerings significantly this quarter. Lens Studio has seen incredible adoption. Over 200 of the Lenses created by our community were viewed over 1 million times in the few months since launch. Our community has used these tools in ways we would have never imagined, and they have inspired us to invest more in empowering their creativity. We recently upgraded Lens Studio to now support the creation of new experiences like soundboards, interactive paths, and face Lenses. We\u2019re also expanding the underlying architecture of Lenses with Snappables, our latest Lens format that helps our community collaborate and interact with their friends through augmented reality experiences.", "Despite some headwinds from our redesign, our advertising business has continued to grow. While our decision to migrate our Snap Ads business to our programmatic auction led to a short-term slowdown in our revenue growth last year, we made the transition quickly and the company is far better for it. We are now better able to manage and optimize our overall advertising business and auction dynamics, which has accelerated the pace with which we can improve ROI for our advertisers. In Q1, both the average cost per app install and the average cost per swipe in the United States were well under half of what they were the year before, and we are continuing to make improvements.", "Our self-serve products helped us increase the number of advertisers actively spending on our platform by 20 times over the past year, and we still have a lot of opportunity to expand from here. With a growing advertiser base, we are now also introducing both paid and organic tools and experiences for companies of all sizes. Snapcodes unlock experiences like creative tools and sticker packs, and we are seeing brands experimenting with Lens Studio to create unique campaigns. Additionally, our product roadmap for empowering creators will also benefit small and large businesses alike and give them a better organic presence on our service.", "Our total revenue for the quarter was $230.7 million, up 54% from last year. Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners. We believe that our current path forward will address both issues, and that our advertising business has benefitted and will continue to benefit from the tough decisions we make in order to create and maintain a positive and healthy environment for our community over the long term.", "Thanks again for joining the call, and I will now turn it over to Imran to talk about our business.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi, everyone. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $229 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year. Evan talked about the philosophy behind the redesign, which is ongoing and a learning process. In Q1, we learned a lot based on how our users reacted to the redesign. But because of that, we also experienced some short-term disruptions to the business. The rapid pace at which we changed the core product introduced increased volatility into our ads marketplace. While we did not grow as quickly as we wanted, our Snap Ad revenue grew 102% year-over-year, and was down only 6% sequentially in a seasonally tough quarter.", "Additionally, during the quarter, we had many conversations with our advertisers about the redesign. These have been challenging conversations, as we made the proactive and deliberate decision to prioritize our long-term consumer product goals over our short-term monetization goals. The impact was primarily felt in our Sponsored Creative Tools business. On top of the expected seasonally weaker demand, our Lens and Filter products, which generally have a higher average selling price, were challenged by a negative market narrative.", "We\u2019re also in the middle of transitioning these products to a programmatic, audience-based buy model, which has negatively impacted the average order value, or AOV, for the products. For example, in Q1, the total number of Lenses sold was up 16% year-over-year, but AOV was down 37%. This is similar to what we experienced during our Snap Ad transition. As we transition all products to our self-service tool, we believe we can drive broader advertiser adoption and ultimately, a long-term, sustainable business.", "While we anticipate that some of these factors may continue to impact our business in Q2, I\u2019m very excited about the second half of this year. This is because of the progress we are making in our three focus areas: number one, enhancing our ad product suite, two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers, and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. In December, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Stories, which allows advertisers to leverage the familiar Stories format that our community knows and loves. But, to better reflect the storytelling capabilities of this format, we\u2019re now calling them Story Ads. We recently brought Story Ads to our self-service tool so that advertisers can use the same advanced targeting that they use for Snap Ads. Since launching this format in the auction, users that chose to watch Story Ads viewed them for an average of over 20 seconds. We believe this is a strong indication that our community is continuing to embrace this format.", "On the direct response side, we continue to make great progress. We believe that when we show the right ad to the right user, it creates a win-win situation. Swipe rates are one indication of whether or not we are creating this win-win situation. Quarter-over-quarter, for campaigns optimized for swipes, we increased our swipe rates by 8 percentage points, while also increasing total swipes by nearly 14 percentage points. This is a testament to the great work that our ad ranking team is doing to show the right ad to the right person.", "We\u2019re also continuing to evolve our formats, and I\u2019m really excited about our recent launch of shoppable Augmented Reality. Since bringing Lenses to market in 2015, we have seen this product drive tons of engagement and even create pop culture moments. But we wanted to bring the power of creative tools to our direct response advertisers. While users are playing with a Lens in the camera, advertisers can now include a button that will redirect them to a long-form video, website, or the app store. The first brands to try this new format include sports company Adidas, maker of the Candy Crush video games King, and make-up brand Clairol. As we scale adoption of this product, we are confident that it will help accelerate the growth of our Lens business as well.", "Our second area of focus is developing efficient tools for advertisers. As we have outlined before, one of our key priorities is to grow our SMB, or Online Sales, business. The vast majority of businesses are SMBs, and they are increasingly adopting digital marketing platforms to grow their businesses. In order to onboard these advertisers, we have been rolling out our self-serve tools and investing to create a frictionless ad buying experience. We made good progress this quarter as evidenced by 30% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth for our SMB business.", "We are also launching sophisticated tools for our large advertisers. For example, we recently launched our Reach and Frequency tool for Snap Ads to a handful of select advertisers in the US and UK. This has been a key request from advertisers looking to plan and buy in advance on Snapchat. Only a few other scaled platforms have brought this tool to market, and it offers predictable delivery and pricing, something that is very valuable for larger brand-focused campaigns. ", "We launched Reach and Frequency within our self-service platform and are partnering closely with Unilever UK, P&G US, Google US and UK, and Microsoft UK. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do to fully bring this tool to market, but we're excited that this new buying method will empower advertisers to efficiently share their stories on our platform.", "One of the products I\u2019m most excited about is Snap Pro for Business and Creators. This product will be made for public entities, from public figures to local businesses to charitable causes, that want to use our platform to organically reach an audience beyond friends and family. With Snap Pro, it will be easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us. We\u2019re still extremely early in our roll-out plan and just recently onboarded a select group of brands and creators.", "For our third area of focus, we remain strongly committed to proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ROI is the best incentive that we can offer our advertisers, and we have been working tirelessly to show it across multiple products and verticals.", "This quarter, we made great progress scaling adoption and usage of Snap Pixel. We nearly tripled the number of advertisers using the pixel quarter-over-quarter. We\u2019re seeing that this capability drives strong results, primarily for our SMB and commerce advertisers.", "One great example is the Ridge, a wallet brand that used Snap Pixel to create both custom and lookalike audiences based on people who made a purchase on their eCommerce site. This strategy delivered. They drove a 4.1 times Return on Ad Spend. It also delivered a 55% decrease in Cost per Action, or CPA, allowing the company to achieve an overall CPA that was more than 20% lower than on other ad platforms.", "We are excited for the future of Snap Pixel as we continue investing in improvements such as the ability to optimize delivery based on lower-funnel events.", "We also understand how important it is for advertisers to measure impact across platforms. From television to social platforms, we want to demonstrate that advertising on Snapchat increases value to an advertiser\u2019s overall strategy. We recently collaborated with Nielsen, using their Total Ad Ratings, which allow advertisers to measure the incremental reach of their Snapchat campaigns relative to TV campaigns. Despite being outspent 25:1 by television, Snapchat campaigns were able to deliver 8% incremental reach on top of TV campaigns for the same set of brands.", "Finally, we are continuing to work with our third-party ecosystem to demonstrate ROI for all verticals. We conducted a series of custom marketing mix model studies with Nielsen to measure the effectiveness of Snapchat advertising within the beer category. The studies showed that Snapchat was more efficient than both traditional channels and other forms of digital media. Snap Ads outperformed the category media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.7 times, while Lenses and Filters outperformed the media average Return on Ad Spend by 4.3 times.", "Overall, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and I\u2019m optimistic about the future of our business.", "Thank you for your time. I will now hand it off to Drew for a financial update.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon, everyone. In the quarter, we made continued progress against our three financial goals: first, grow users and sales; second, leverage our cost structure; and third, soundly manage cash. As Imran mentioned, sales grew meaningfully year-over-year. Equally important, sales growth continues to well outpace our cost growth year-over-year.", "Over the past few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to make the right long-term decisions for our business. One of our core financial strategies was to invest early ahead of the sales curve to build the right cost structure that we could both scale with our growth and leverage over time.", "In the first quarter, we successfully leveraged our cost structure. Year-over-year sales growth was over 1.5 times our cost growth, and sequential costs were up only 1% in the quarter. On a per-user basis, ARPU increased 34% year-over-year, twice as fast as our CoRPU growth. Cost of revenue grew modestly, and operating expenses were sequentially down for the second time in three quarters, excluding restructuring charges.", "An efficient cost structure is a central part of our financial roadmap. We will continue to invest in strategic areas like innovation, new products, and people to fuel future growth. That said, we believe many of these opportunities can be funded by running our business more effectively, in areas like the back of house and hosting infrastructure. As we continue to successfully manage our cost structure, it should continue to yield two key benefits. First, we see strong incremental flow-through on revenue growth. And second, we can continue to moderate our cash burn, which we did again in Q1, as cash burn was less than half the rate from a few quarters ago.", "Let me now expand on the results for the quarter. First, global revenues were 231 million in the first quarter, and we saw growth in every region. International markets now represent 26% of our total revenue, up from 14% a year ago and 23% in Q4. Consistent with prior quarters, the fastest growing product in Q1 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold programmatically. Strength in Snap Ads more than offset softness in Creative Tools sales, which were down in the quarter.", "As expected, auction revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing. Let me share some numbers with you. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, were up over 450% year-over-year and over 15% sequentially. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Story Ads, was down nearly 65% year-over-year and nearly 20% sequentially. Third, we ended the quarter with 95% of our Snaps Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, served programmatically, up from 90% in the prior quarter.", "In the quarter, we added many new programs to the Discover page. In February, we partnered with NBC to bring the Winter Olympics to Snapchat users. We offered a series of creative ad products and packages to our advertisers, which drove incremental revenues for the business. Financially, the Olympics were a nice revenue boost, but comprised less than 10% of total revenues for the quarter.", "Now, let me talk about expenses. Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures, including gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "Cost of revenue expenses grew $7 million in the quarter, driven by three factors. First, higher revenue share on Olympic content; second, incremental infrastructure costs related to the launch of the app redesign; and third, the addition of 4.2 million new DAUs. Hosting costs per user increased from $0.70 in Q4 to $0.73 in Q1, but hosting cost increases moderated during the quarter as our engineering team continued to optimize new code to reduce infrastructure expenses.", "On operating expenses, the primary driver remains people cost. Over the last few years, we have consistently invested to build an organization with the scale to compete. We hired over 2,400 people in the last two years and we\u2019re now digesting that rapid growth in an evolving world. As a result, during Q1 we had a 7% reduction in force, in order to better align resources around our top strategic priorities and reflect structural changes in our business.", "Consistent with earlier disclosures, the company recorded a charge of $9.9 million in the first quarter, but those charges have been adjusted out of EBITDA. We expect to realize $7 million to $8 million in ongoing savings per quarter. In the first quarter, OpEx costs were $257 million, down 1% sequentially, and overall headcount declined 3% for the period.", "Let me briefly touch on our capital-deployment priorities, which remain reinvesting in strategic areas of our business like product, content, AR, automation, and international expansion as well as opportunistic M&A. Q1 CapEx remained modest at $36 million and we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. As of March 31, 2018, total shares outstanding were 1.254 billion and 1.457 billion on a fully diluted basis.", "Let me now share some near-term observations on our business. First, as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels, with growth in auction impressions, partially offset by pricing for both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. We are planning for infrastructure costs to increase modestly in the short-term as we continue to test and rollout further changes to the application, partially offset by hosting cost efficiency programs. Revenue share expenses should moderate without Olympic content.", "We continue to plan for modest operating expense growth in the near term. Consistent with last quarter, we are planning for the first half of 2018 to grow by low double-digits versus the back half of 2017, excluding one-time charges. Please note operating expenses exclude cost of revenue, stock-based compensation, and our move to Santa Monica.", "Consistent with prior disclosures on the Venice exit, we expect to incur $25 million to $45 million in charges throughout 2018, primarily in the second and third quarters, to reflect the exit cost of these Venice buildings. The majority of these charges are cash payments due on remaining lease terms. We are planning for CapEx to be slightly elevated in the near term, as we continue our buildout of leased Santa Monica facilities and execute our move throughout 2018.", "With respect to stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense, our Q1 expense was $143.2 million. Please note that this number included a one-time benefit of $32 million, as a result of the reduction in force plan we implemented during the quarter. We believe that the stock-based compensation rate in the second half of 2017 is a good proxy for the short-term. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to this amount.", "With that, I will now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Two questions, guys. One for Evan and then one for Drew. Evan, on the DAUs, it seems like anytime you guys are making changes to the Android app, you're running into some performance issues and DAUs tend to drop off. So I guess what gives you the confidence as you ship this new Android code in the second half of this year that we'll see a stabilization and when do you expect Android to use to start kind of consistently picking up.", "And then Drew, you mentioned the 2Q revenue growth will be substantially lower, so would that just be Olympics impact coming out or can you talk a little bit more specifically about the deceleration in ad revenue versus the 61% in the first quarter. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi, Ross. We should have made a lot of changes faster in our engineering organization and really put Android first. Now, and I'm starting -- last year, we started re-architecting the entire application and rebuilding it from scratch and we now have a bunch of those components and we're testing some already in the application, but ultimately it\u2019s the re-architecture that will make a big difference and I think beyond just the performance improvements that we're going to see, it will also enable our entire team to move a lot faster as we build new features. Right now, if we build a new feature, the codebase is so complex, we tend to break other things and I think reducing the complexity through modularization will make a huge difference in our ability to execute quickly on the product roadmap.", "Drew Vollero", "So Ross, as it relates to the second quarter, we were really focused on the strategic activities in business, not necessarily the near term financial targets. We're really focused on improving the redesign, improving Android, driving users to platform, driving our advertiser ROI. If you look at the platform itself at the product level, we have strength in Span Ads that direct response business is doing quite well internationally, has been a growing force as well. But look, at the end of the day, we are transitioning right now to the creative tool business Imran talked about in his opening remarks and we really are focused on being the value leader in the advertising platform and so what we're not doing is playing the pricing game to maximize short term revenues. We're really more focused on bringing advertisers to the platform and making sure advertisers have solid ROIs. There was a modest boost in the quarter as you mentioned, to Olympic revenue, which we don't expect to continue in Q2, but that's not a big piece of the story here.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mark Mahaney", "In the past, I think you've talked about crash levels on the Android app, any sort of update there as to how they're trending? And then you talked about this disruption to users. What have you seen in the quarter so far in terms of those disruptions to users, any impact on engagement? Does it seem to you like you're back to normal with your users\u2019 use of the app? Is there still a lot of experimentation just how would you address the volatility of the overall user base in response to the redesigns?", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. No specific updates on the crash levels. I do want to talk about one of the big changes that we're making to Snap, which I think will make a big difference. When we redesign the application, we combine the stories and chats from your friends onto the same page. And we like having all the stuff from your friends in one place, because it was a lot easier to find, but we didn't realize how hard it would be to optimize for those two different behaviors, talking with friends and watching their stories and it turns out it's really hard to optimize for both at the same time. So one of the biggest changes that we're making is moving stories from your friends over to the Discover page and putting it at the top of the page. So they'll still be separate from all the other content on our service, but that way your friends come first, no matter where you are in the application, but we can still optimize for watching content on one side of service and communicating with friends on the other. So that's a big change coming and we think it will make a difference.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "Great. Two things. I think in your prepared remarks, you said users were stabilizing in April, maybe you could revisit that a little bit? And then Imran, how much of the 2Q deceleration is related to the redesign and how are you thinking, you mentioned you expected a big back half, how would you think about an improvement in the back half on advertising?", "Imran Khan", "Yes. Hi. So let's take the second question first. So I think one of the things that we have done, we listen to our advertisers very closely and what are the products that they want and I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about how we will have launched reach and frequency with two advertisers. We also launching SNAP Pro, which will let people to create content and then ultimately promote those content. We are also launching lower funnel optimization for our performance advertising products. All of those things, I think, will significantly help our advertisers to take leverage of our platform. And then on top of that, what we're doing in terms of on ad ranking side by improving swipe rate and showing the right ad to the right users. And as our mission gets better and better, I think there's a lot of opportunities on that. So I'm really optimistic that I think we're doing the right thing and building the right thing.", "In terms of Evan\u2019s comment on, I think we said we are seeing early sign of stabilization on iOS.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Thanks. So Evan, I think at the time of the IPO one of the concerns was the need for your ad ops teams to essentially vet the creative, so that if fits in with the surrounding content and does not work against a consumer experience, but now that you are going more self-service, you have certain instances, which I guess result in the negative market creative, you touched on earlier. So it seems like there's a need to police the add creators as well, so is there a technology base or some other type of solution that can look for that type of ad content to take down? And Imran, a question on the story is the need to reformat the ad content to vertical presentations still a headwind for you? And if so, what are you doing to help advertisers either from a technology or proper perspective?", "Evan Spiegel", "Stephen. Yeah, we have a lot of empathy for the ad reviewers who work on our business. It's a tough job. We really consider them digital first responders in a sense and so we're definitely building out a lot of programs to try and help them do their jobs more effectively and we always feel terrible when mistakes are made, but we're making progress there and really we want to do our best to support the team and doing their job.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to story ad, I think what we're seeing that market is more and more embracing our format. I think 3.5 years ago, when you started the ad business, I think this full screen vertical video was very foreign to many advertisers and we heard a lot of pushback, but I think over the years, we have seen that advertisers are seeing the value of the full screen ad and the storytelling ad and we're seeing that other advertisers, other publishers also embracing these formats. So I think it is -- the headwind is getting better and I think we're also building a lot of creatives and I think one of our mission is creating friction less application experience and I think we're making a lot of progress there and we continue to invest on that technology.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "We\u2019ve seen some of the changes that you're talking about in terms of separating out stories and from Snaps and sort of the next evolution of this redesign, realize, it's extremely early, but any sort of indication in terms of how users are reacting to that. I know you're not going to go into specific metrics, but just even qualitatively what you're hearing from them? And then to the extent that we're sort of seeing pricing fluctuation, the way we are in the early innings of your moves into the programmatic, any sense sort of where pricing on any sort of like for like basis is shaking out between where Snap and other major digital platforms would be? I know it's not always easy to compare apples and oranges, but whether it's a ROI metric or price per engagement, would be curious in any benchmarking you might be able to share insight into.", "Evan Spiegel", "When we build products, we\u2019re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away, we're thinking a lot about how our products that we've built will help us accomplish our mission. So, we build things that we believe that will help us empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. And so I think it's really important to understand that people think about self-expression on Snapchat in different ways. So some people would rather create content with just a small audience of their friends and other people want to create content if they have a much bigger audience because they want to reach more people. ", "And so our job is to make Snap work well for all different types of people so that we can empower people to express themselves. And with the redesign in particular, we try to make Snapchat feel more personal for people who want to use it exclusively with their friends and also more valuable for people who want to use at large audience, because we want to do both really well. So we believe the redesign brings us closer to accomplishing our mission. And we're continuing to iterate very quickly on the things that we don't like.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to pricing, we are really focused on driving advertisers ROI and bringing more and more advertisers on our platform, because when you have a lot more users, we have more choices to show to the right users. And I think we're also a new platform, so we want advertisers to learn our platform and how to win on our platform. And so fundamentally, we're not really focused on pricing right now, we are really more focused on bringing more advertisers on the platform and helping them understand our platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "I think you mentioned earlier that pricing is down 65% year-on-year and then when talking about the substantial de-sell [ph] in Q2, I think you noted that pricing is a primary driver there. I guess the question is where are we in that adjustment period and at what point do you expect that pricing will begin to stabilize? And then in terms of the redesign we\u2019re putting friends\u2019 stories above discover content, what impact do you think that that will have on engagement with commercial content and ultimately with some of the ad revenues that flow through that part of the channel.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to pricing, the 65% decline year-over-year really represents the change in selling method, we used to have a direct sales force that sold of the ads top of funnel. Now, we\u2019ve gone to programmatic, and so that's really led to the year-over-year decline. I'll echo Imran\u2019s sentiments, right now, the key activities that we're focused on are really bringing advertisers to the platform. We need a broader base of advertisers using our product and then see if really we're very focused on ROI. We do think that will be the number one metric for us in the long term success. So that's what we're focused on far more than sort of where pricing bottoms out. We don't have the near term plan for that.", "Evan Spiegel", "In terms of the Discover product, we believe that making Snapchat is the best place to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world and have fun together. We will build a larger audience for creators and ultimately benefit them and we\u2019re also introducing a lot of new tools this year for creators, which we believe will inspire them to continue creating great content for Snap. So ultimately, we're taking a long view here and we believe that as users experience our products, we will be able to build our audience and that will benefit creators.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Two if I can. First Imran, I think you said March average DAU is lower than 1Q average, but still up in the 4Q average, which seems to imply that maybe March ended lower than where you were in December kind of on a period end basis. Can you kind of talk about if April is down from March and then do you think the early results from moving friends\u2019 stories back to the right side of the camera does suggest that allowing help stabilize DAU?", "And then secondly, can you give us a sense for what percent of ad revenue now is coming from performance advertisers and maybe a sense of how the more sophisticated performance advertisers who have adopted the best most sophisticated tools, how they\u2019re scaling budgets plus those adoption rates. Can you maybe give us an update on the percent of at Ad Age 100 that are still spending if you will from the kind of 1Q \u201916 period, so can you give us that would be great.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I'll take from the like last question first. Look. I think we're seeing great success with a lot of the large advertisers. We strengthen our relationship with several brands like take McDonald's as an excellent example, they have pushed a multiproduct approach for nearly every campaign, always looking to test, optimize and learn with us. In fact, they were one of the first advertisers to test audience filters in action, creating seven different filters and targeting each one to a niche audience. ", "But most importantly, over the years, Snapchat has gone from being a platform that McDonald's would leverage periodically to an always on long term partners. Year over year, McDonald's grew their investment triple digit with us. So we're really pleased, we had a lot of success stories like that. We're becoming true business partner for a lot of large advertisers but at the same time we're seeing healthy growth in our performance advertising campaign. And I think we\u2019ve got great feedback from them and based on that, we're trying to bring creative tools also to the DR customers and that business is going at a very healthy rate and we're very, very excited about it.", "With regards to DAU, I think we gave you the average for the quarter was 191 million. Q4 average was 187. I believe what Evan talked about in his prepared remarks that March was lower than our Q1 average of 191, but higher than the Q4 average of 187. So that should give you a pretty good guidance where that numbers were in March.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.", "Jason Helfstein", "I wanted to dig a bit more. So for all the examples of McDonald's of triple digits, I guess how much of the weakness or relative to what we're all expecting was from advertisers who pulled back because of call it misunderstanding or questions or publicity and so the point is like what did it take to get those advertisers back. And is that -- the point being you expect those advertisers to be back in the third quarter, just go a little bit deeper into that, what caused the advertisers toward spending to pull back and what makes you -- and what gives you confidence they come back.", "Imran Khan", "Look, I think -- thanks for asking the question. At the end of the day, advertisers are rational. They want to advertise and they want to drive return on their ad spend. But at the same time, they're human. When there's a lot of negative news on the press every day, it does give people pause, it does influence people buying decisions, know it's very hard to handicap how what percentage, but that does come out on the conversation and become a disruption on the selling process. But I think the way to win is by proving otherwise, right. The examples like McDonald's or some of the examples that I shared on the call, when we go and prove that, but I just had the money that this spent and we drive value for them. ", "It's really, really important. I think one of the things that is really important to understand that the Snapchat\u2019s position in the millennial audience, right, there are over 90 million millennials in the US today and they represent the single largest generation ever defined. Millennials are expected to become a huge economic force in the coming years that already dominating lot of buying decisions. And we have a very strong position in that demographic and some of the investment that our product team and engineering team did to swing the right ad to the right audience. I think that we -- and we just need to prove those ROIs and educate the market and that's ultimately drive value for everybody.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge ", "So ad impressive growth has been significant the past several quarters, just wondering how you feel about ad loads and ability to raise ad loads and then just any update on engagement. I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it, time spent on the platform, anything there would be helpful?", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think again -- I think about the problem is ad is a piece of content and when it's a piece of content, you have to show the most relevant content to the most relevant person and that really drives the engagement, right. If I show you one content that you don't care about it, if I show you one piece of content, you will be annoyed. If I show you three great pieces of content that you really, really like and you want to engage with it, that you will like it. So I think rather than thinking about the ad load, what we have been challenging our product team and our engineering team, are we doing the best job showing the most relevant content to our users. When you do that, everybody wins. And I think one of the thing I talked about in the call that how we saw 8 percentage point increase in swipe rate. And I think that's really, really exciting and that's something I think there's a lot more work to be done and we continue to push out teams to do that. ", "In terms of time spent, I think Evan mentioned in the call that more than over 30 minutes people are due to spend on our platform, over 30 minutes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Just first you talk about self-serve helping increase the advertiser number 20x over the past year. Just curious if you\u2019ve quantified that number? And then, Imran, can you just talk more about the concept, the moving to always on spending and how much that's actually happening across the platforms at this point? And then just quickly, do you think you're seeing any impact in users from competitive entertainment like Fortnite and PUBG?", "Imran Khan", "So with regards to -- look I think in terms of number of advertisers, we launch our self-serve platform in Q2 of last year. So it's a very new platform. So we have a lot of room to grow our number of advertisers on our platform, and I think so we have a lot of work to do and we're very pleased with the growth, but we want to grow faster and there's a lot of room to grow.", "With regards to competitive pressure from other games like Fortnite, my son who is 8 years old loves playing that game. I played with him over the weekend, but I think it's really hard for me to sit here and predict how that's spending impacting time on our platform at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two. The first one, appreciate the color on the Snap ad versus the creative tools, the lender\u2019s growth in the quarter. Wondering, could you talk us through how we should think about the growth trajectory of those two businesses over the course of the year, maybe the relative size and just to think about the puts and takes on revenue growth between those two buckets this year?", "And the second one, you talked a lot about a focus to bring more advertisers on to the platform. Maybe talk through philosophically how has your advertiser onboarding process changed between large advertisers and SMBs. What are the keys to success going forward?", "Drew Vollero", "Good. As it relates to the product mix, we never really quantify the difference between the Snap ads and the creative tools. We gave some sense maybe a couple of years ago about the size of a business we described in a sort of a good one two combination and both very meaningful to our business. I would say with the move to programmatic over the last six to twelve months, the Snap Ads business has become a much bigger piece of our business than the creative tools. And so the Snap Ads business continues to grow. We have good traction internationally. We have good traction on the DR side of the world. So we are definitely seeing that being the engine that\u2019s fueling our growth right now. I think the creative business will continue \u2013 the creative tool business will continue to transition that as we commented on in the second quarter here, those are -- that's what we're seeing in the near term. So right now, the bulk of the revenue is being driven by the Snap ads business and that's really the engine that's going to fuel our growth in the near term.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah. I think to add on Drew\u2019s color, I think our creative tool business also have a lot of opportunities like more recently we launched Lens Studios for example. It really democratize who can create lenses. I think one of the big challenge for a lot of the small businesses to create creative tools is that they have to work with us directly, but as the Lens Studios and those things proliferated, they have the opportunities for a lot of advertisers to embrace this creative tools business, that's also opened up new revenue opportunity for us. So I think we feel very excited about that, how we are monetizing camera and at the same time, we\u2019re monetizing content on our platform and how there are a lot more opportunities to do that. ", "With regards to your second question, how you\u2019re addressing the market, we break up ourselves in two different groups. One is DSO, direct sales organization who focus on the large advertisers and they are really a sales consultant for those. The second bucket is our global online sales team, so that has combination of inside sales and our channel partners. So we partner with other channels who actually sell on behalf of us as well. So that's how we were trying to cover across the market and educate them about the platform and to help onboard more and more advertisers on the platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Rich Greenfield", "Hi. A few questions. First just housekeeping. I wanted to follow up on the question before regarding Evan's commentary on DAUs If you look at kind of March 2018 quarter end, should we infer basically, is the inference essentially that March quarter end for \u201918 was actually below December 2017 quarter end? And then two, on product, Evan, you mentioned shifting friends\u2019 content over to the right, which I certainly understand, but part of the new right side redesign not only was it algorithmic, but it was also kind of everything. ", "So it was like one solid flowing experience where it almost felt like you got lost and you were just clicking, you have this kind of infinite array of content. Now, as you start to separate out friends from everything else, discover, kind of brand/implementers, how does that impact time spent in the discover/influencer content on the right side relative to friends? And then just a part of that, could that actually cause a disruption as you kind of shift the stories back to the right, are we looking at another potential disruption in user behavior, as people get used to that type of a change back. That would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So overall, as we look at the redesign, the thing that we're most excited about is creating this infinite scroll content. As you mentioned, in the past, the right side of the application really only had your friends\u2019 stories and a very small select group of publishers without a lot of personalization. And so I think one of the really great things that we've been able to accomplish with the redesign is putting your friends at the top, making them most important, but also still opening up into this world of personalized content below. So I think, we're going to get the best of both worlds in that sense and still create an environment where people feel empowered to express themselves.", "And I don't think we can give you any specifics on the earlier DAU question, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore.", "Anthony DiClemente", "I just wanted to follow up on that question about content. In terms of \u2013 it just sounds based on what you\u2019ve said Evan that there could be a transition and emphasis to user generated content, given the changes in the Discover tab and I guess if not, maybe just what is your forward strategy with respect to licensed professional content from here?", "And then a question for Drew, you stated in your prepared remarks that future acquisitions will likely be additive to stock-based compensation. So I'm curious what areas is Snap actively pursuing in terms of M&A and how do you think about balancing the potential M&A with your priorities around cash management from here?", "Drew Vollero", "Let me take the second one first and then I'll turn it over to Evan. Look, we've had a lot of success managing our cash burn rate over the last couple of quarters. We've reduced it by over 50%. How we've done that is we\u2019ve really focused the strategic capital deployment priorities here at the company. We're really focused on investing in our business. The M&A here will be very opportunistic. If we see the right thing at the right time at the right price, we\u2019ll go ahead and make that happen, but right now, we're focused on really the key strategic activities of growing our business around the design, around the Android, new advertisers\u2019 ROI, those are the strategic priorities in the business. If we have a chance to be opportunistic, with an acquisition, we will go ahead and do that. Historically, the acquisitions have been pretty tuck-in in nature. They've been focused more on technologies and talent than they have been sort of robust acquisitions, big companies, big business models, et cetera. So that's where we've been focused to date. And I'd look for again our strategic priorities for cash really to be the investment in the business.", "Evan Spiegel", "Ultimately, users\u2019 content has obviously been a strong suit for us for a very long time, because we're so focused on powering creativity, opening to the camera and building all these creative tools that inspire people to create. I think as we look at the redesign and the opportunity for publishers and creators, we're definitely excited about the progress we\u2019ll be able to make for both last year, we delivered $100 million in revenue to our partners and we're excited to build on that. So I think publishers will play a very important role in the future and also create more opportunities for creators and influencers to be successful on Snap.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust.", "Youssef Squali", "Two quick questions for me. First, maybe Evan, you referenced changes in market narrative as a reason for the softness. Just trying to understand kind of the other side of that is for the market narrative to change again, I'm assuming this is on the advertiser side, there is really no control necessarily in terms of timing. So you talked about how Q3 is going to be an inflection point for that, just trying to get a sense of, if advertisers have now, so to speak, put you guys in the penalty box, what kind of gives you the confidence that you can get out of it within a quarter? ", "And then on the profitability side, there were some news reports talking about how maybe you gave directives internally to accelerate dramatically accelerate the profitability of the business. First, is there any truth to that? And second, how do you look at and maybe this is a question for Drew partly as well, balance out the profitability versus the doubling down of the investments as you suggest in your prepared remarks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yeah. So in terms of profitability, obviously, building a sustainable business is what's going to allow us to pursue our mission for a really long time. So it's something we think about and I think we've made great progress over the last few years towards being able to fund our own growth. I think if we look at the big transition we made last year to our programmatic advertising business, I think the really great benefit of that is we've gotten a lot better at showing advertisers ROI, so the market narrative I think will matter less over time, as we continue to improve our measurement capabilities and to really deliver that for advertisers. So excited about the progress that we're making there. And you're right that it's important to focus on the performance business.", "Drew Vollero", "So, I will -- just to build on Evan's comments, I mean, it makes sense for us to build toward a breakeven. It's a logical next step for our business, but let's be clear, we really don't manage against that. There is no timeline to take that of the certain date. The key thing to remember is that, that's going to for us begin with growth. We need to continue to grow our user base. We need to grow our revenues. We\u2019re going to keep investing in areas like product innovation, AR and content to name a few. That said, Snap for breakeven also is going to revolve around carrying water in both shoulders for us, you have to be sensible about our cost structure. We have a moderate cost growth where it makes sense. We have a large infrastructure for a company our size. We\u2019re built for growth and you saw that in Q1 that we were able to leverage the cost structure, our cost growth was only up 1% sequentially. So there are opportunities for us to do things better and that should allow us to continue to make investments that will fuel our growth.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today's session and you may now disconnect."]}

[Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ms. Sam Stewart, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Sam Stewart", "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Snap Inc.'s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagements and financial metrics for the first quarter of 2017 which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our first quarter 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements and we make no obligation to update our disclosures.", "For more information about the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks described in our prospectus dated March 1, 2017, particularly in the section entitled risk factors and our other filings with the SEC, when available.", "Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website.", "At times in our prepared comments or in response to your questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.", "I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website at investor.Snap.com to find the earnings press release issued today, a presentation that accompanies our earnings release, periodic SEC reports, a webcast replay of today's call or to learn more about Snap.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hi, everyone and welcome to the call. During the first quarter, we focused our efforts primarily on the performance and quality of our Snapchat application and automation across our content products and advertising business. We're pleased with the early results from these performance and quality improvements, particularly on Android devices. These improvements helped drive a significant increase in engagement, with now over 3 billion Snaps created every day with our cameras, generating an increase in overall sessions and time spent.", "We were also able to more than double the number of net additional users coming from Android devices compared to last quarter. And Android users accounted for over 30% of net additional users this quarter, up from 20% last quarter. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're excited by the amount of progress we've made in such a short time.", "We averaged 166 million daily active users for the quarter. Worldwide net additional users in Q1 increased by 54% compared to Q4 as we continued to expand our community in North America and Europe. We also managed to make some headway in the rest of world, largely due to improvements on Android.", "Towards the end of the first quarter, we began to roll out our search product. Search is exciting for us because it begins to expose the so-called long tail of content on our service. With so many Snaps created every day, there really is a story for everything on Snapchat. Search surfaces interesting Stories created by machine learning and allows our community to find Stories for anything they might be interested in.", "We made significant progress in automating our advertising business this quarter, with more than 20% of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically through our API. Automating our ads platform means that advertisers get better pricing, our community sees better ads and we're able to make more money per impression.", "Overall, I feel we have executed well on our priorities for this quarter, performance, quality and automation. Our progress this quarter should provide a strong foundation as we continue to build our business.", "With that, I will turn it over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We're very pleased with our Q1 achievements. We're really excited about the progress we have made increasing engagement across Snapchat. We believe that great advertising starts with strong user engagement. As Evan mentioned, time spent for our users continues to grow. On average, in Q1 our users spent over 30 minutes per day on Snapchat. This increase is largely because of the unique content on our platform.", "Snapchat offers exclusive content from several perspectives, friends and family, our global community and premium publishers. With user Stories, Snapchatters see the world through the eyes of their friends and family. Our community creates and sends billions of Snaps every day as a fun and easy way to communicate and stay up to date with their closest friends.", "With our Stories, Snapchatters stay informed and connected to the world around them. This past quarter, we told over 450 Our Stories in over eight languages to our global community. Our expert teams curate Snaps submitted by Snapchatters around the world's biggest moments, such as breaking news, entertainment and sports.", "In February, Our Story coverage of the Oscars received over 250,000 submissions from Snapchatters. This allowed us to curate multi-perspective stories full of unique content that is exclusive to our platform. Over 21 million global unique viewers tuned in to watch our Oscars coverage, indicating to us that the power of these stories is resonating with our community.", "With publisher's Stories, Snapchatters engage with premium content curated by some of the most credible media companies in the world. We expanded our offerings in Q1 by launching nine new partners in the U.S. and one in Norway. This brings us to a total of 55 global partners as of Q1 2017.", "We work with Nielsen on custom analysis on Snapchat's unique daily reach in the U.S., when Nielsen found that 45% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are reached by Snapchat on any given day. This is nine times more than the average daily reach of the top 15 TV networks and nearly 5 times more than the top TV network.", "Additionally, 87% of our U.S. daily active users between the ages of 18 and 34 cannot be reached by any top 15 TV network. Our platform allows us to engage an audience that research shows is difficult to reach. We believe that the ability to deliver this type of reach and engagement is the cornerstone of a great advertising business.", "Now I would like to share some of the progress we have made to benefit advertisers in three key areas, one, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and, three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising.", "First, enhancing our ad product suite. We started our advertising business by servicing big brands. This strategy proved invaluable. These partners have high standards and provided great feedback that shaped our priorities. Universal Pictures was our first advertiser in the fall of 2014. Since then, they have challenged us to find unique and effective ways to reach the right audience for each campaign. We have been a go-to partner for nearly every single title, helping them across a variety of objectives. From 2015 to 2016, Universal more than doubled their spend with us which we feel is a testament to the returns they have seen on their early investment.", "And we continue to listen and develop new solutions to serve our advertisers. By listening to our partners, we learned that advertisers are hungry for more effective direct response advertising solutions. This meant enhancing our Snap Ad brand's experience with interactive capabilities which we call Snap Ads with Attachments. Attachments help advertisers accomplish specific goals by providing a way for users to engage with a Snap Ad.", "For example, a user who watches a Snap Ad for a new Hollywood movie can swipe up to view the full trailer or buy a ticket, all without leaving Snapchat. I would like to share a couple of examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments are driving value for our performance advertisers.", "Acorns, a micro investing app, partnered with us on an app install campaign to drive both brand awareness and app installs. With this campaign we delivered a 300% increase in app installs. Fullscreen also continues to partner with us on various direct response initiatives. They consistently see higher active viewing rates from users who come in via Snap Ads compared to other platforms. And each time we collaborate together, they continue to see lower costs per acquisition.", "We have designed our ad products to work well on their own or when used together in integrated campaigns. We have many advertisers that now leverage Snapchat with an always-on strategy.", "Throughout Q1, Snapchat was a strategic mobile partner to Anheuser-Busch's core brands, including Bud Light, Budweiser, Michelob Ultra and Busch. Anheuser-Busch leveraged Snapchat as an always-on video partner, utilizing all of our ad products for a variety of initiatives. This included sports partnership like NFL, MLB and NASCAR, as well as holidays and tent-poles, like St. Patrick's Day.", "L'Oreal U.S.A is another great example. They have made us an always-on part of their strategy, augmenting Lens and Geofilter executions with Snap Ads. L'Oreal U.S.A has taken advantage of Snapchat's premium, contextually relevant publisher content in combination with advanced targeting in user Stories, to keep their brands top of mind with customers.", "The second area we have focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We want to make it easy and painless for both the largest brands and the smallest local businesses to advertise on Snapchat. This includes how advertisers buy, create and manage their ads. We're still in the early stages of building these tools and we're making good progress.", "In Q1 2016, we launched our on-demand Geofilters tool or ODG. To date we have tens of thousands of advertisers creating and managing their own geofiltered campaigns. This past quarter, we launched line of credit for ODG to make it even easier for all advertisers to buy ads.", "Our most significant step was with the launch of our API and auction in Q4 of last year. We have been working hard to scale our auction to make it something valuable to advertisers of all sizes. Today, our API is live in 24 countries and serving some of the world's largest brands in addition to small and medium-sized businesses.", "Last week we announced our first Snap Ads self-service product, called Snapchat Ad Manager. Our goal is to put the power of our ad products into the hands of every advertiser, regardless of their size. This tool supports all of our ad products, targeting capabilities; and goal-based auction solutions which allows advertisers to bid for swipes or bid for app installs.", "The third area of focus is proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Delivering metrics and proving ROI to advertisers has been a massive area of progress over the past 12 months. Today we have 13 different third-party measurement partners and this list will continue to grow. We also invested heavily in Snap to Store, our own first-of-its-kind measurement offering. Snap to Store allows advertisers to measure foot traffic and demographics for Snapchatters after they see ads on our platform. These kind of location-based online to off-line measurement is a strength for Snapchat and in many ways a Holy Grail of ad measurement.", "During the 2016 holiday season, Hollister ran a Snap Ads campaign. And within seven days of seeing the ad, Snap to Store found that over 63,000 incremental Snapchatters visited a Hollister store nationally.", "Overall, we're excited about the progress we have made as we scale our advertising business. We have a lot of work to do in the rest of 2017 and look for -- to what's ahead.", "Thanks, everyone, for the time. And now I will hand it over to Drew.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Growth in new users, engagement and year-over-year revenues highlighted our first quarter results. Revenues grew 286% year-over-year to $149.6 million, driven primarily by strong advertiser demand. Revenues in North America were $128.7 million in the first quarter, up 259% year-over-year. In Europe, revenues were $13.1 million, up 385% year-over-year. Rest of world revenues were $7.8 million, up from only a couple hundred thousand dollars, a year ago.", "Sequentially, first quarter revenues were down 10% compared to Q4 2016. This anticipated decline was primarily driven by the expected seasonality from advertising which comprises the bulk of our revenues.", "Snap sold revenue was $129 million, approximately 86% of total revenues. Partner sold revenue was $12.3 million and other revenues were $8.3 million, primarily driven by Spectacles. Total revenues outside North America for Q1 were 14% of sales, up from 7% of sales, a year ago. Average revenue per user or ARPU, was $0.90 in the first quarter, up from $0.32 a year ago but sequentially lower than Q4.", "We believe North America remains a leading indicator for the scale potential of our business. North American ARPU was $1.81, more than double our global average which was up 170% versus last year. Both Snap Ads and Creative Tools were meaningful revenue drivers for the business. New products like the API were also key revenue drivers in Q1.", "Now turning to expenses, we have two primary cost components, cost of revenue and operating expenses. Please note that when I discuss these expense figures, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Cost of revenue is primarily comprised of hosting costs and revenue share expenses. Operating expenses are driven by headcount costs. We utilize third parties to provide our infrastructure. This strategy has allowed us to focus on product innovation while we leverage their expertise, their capital and their operating efficiencies. We estimate this capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures to date, while delivering competitive daily costs to serve our users.", "In the quarter, we made good progress against our hosting costs in two key areas. First, we started to migrate to a dual cloud environment using both Google and Amazon to host our infrastructure. And second, we signed new contracts with each provider which lowered costs for most of our key services. As such, hosting expenses fell 12% in the quarter sequentially, down from $113 million to $99 million. These savings more than offset the increases we incurred from growing engagement.", "Relatedly, total cost of revenue fell sequentially $10.3 million or 6%, driven by those hosting savings, partially offset by revenue share expenses which grew slightly. Revenue share expenses increased by shifting the structure of certain revenue share contracts from variable to fixed fee arrangements which raised costs in the quarter but could create leverage as the year progresses and as revenues expand.", "As mentioned, cost of revenue is closely linked to our capital expenditures. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $18 million and were primarily spent on the expansion of our global office footprint. Capital expenditures were $20.4 million in Q4 2016, so Q1 expenses were down 12% sequentially.", "Operating expenses increased 18% sequentially to $196.2 million in the first quarter. We continue to invest in acquiring engineering talent and scaling our global operations. Expenses related to headcount were over 75% of total operating expenses in the quarter. We ended the quarter with 2,360 employees, up from 1,859 at the end of 2016.", "Our financial strategies for operating expenses are threefold, first, to continue to invest in engineering and sales; second, to leverage G&A expenses; and, third, to moderate overall cost growth per head. In the quarter, we made progress against all three goals. 90% of our new hires were in engineering and sales. Additionally, G&A expenses fell from 39% to 32% of total operating expenses. And third, operating expenses per head declined 7% sequentially. Our overall business remains in investment mode.", "Scale operations related to recruiting and facilities are incurred upfront while monetization occurs more gradually. As such, nominal losses increased in the quarter.", "GAAP net loss was $2.2 billion for the quarter which included the expected stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $2 billion as a result of our IPO. Stock-based compensation expense was significantly higher than prior periods due to two factors. First, the recognition of expenses related to RSUs for which the performance condition was triggered by the completion of our IPO in March. And second, an award granted to our CEO which we expensed in its entirety during the quarter.", "Total unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2017 RSUs at the end of Q1 is $1.3 billion, expected to be recognized over a period of slightly more than three years, of which about half of that expense we expect to recognize during the remainder of 2017. RSUs granted during 2017 will be an additional expense.", "Adjusted EBITDA loss was $188.2 million in Q1 2017, compared to a loss of $152.3 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $93.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total shares outstanding at the end of Q1 was 1,179 million and 1,432 million on a fully diluted basis.", "We remain in a strong cash position. Cash and marketable securities increased sequentially from $987.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion at the end of Q1, primarily from the proceeds of our IPO in early March. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Product innovation and execution remain top priorities for 2017.", "I'll now turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.", "Mark Mahaney", "Two sets of questions. Drew, would you care to comment at all about how to think about DAU growth near term through the balance of the year? And any commentary on when we could see peak EBITDA losses?", "And then, Evan, if you think about the product roadmap, are there particular areas you think that we as investors should focus on? I know you mentioned a couple of improvements you made to the Android platform. Other -- on the Apple side, are there particular new features that have been rolled out recently or are about to be rolled out that you think could be meaningful in terms of user and engagement growth? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Mark. I'd love to speak a little bit to the DAU question, because it's a question that we get all the time. And I think one of the reasons why it's such a popular question is because there's a lot of this thing in our industry called growth hacking, where you send a lot of push notifications to users or you try to get them to do things that might be unnatural or something like that.", "And I think while that's the easy way to grow daily actives quickly, we don't think that those sorts of techniques are very sustainable over the long term. And I think that can ultimately impact our relationship with the customer.", "And so I can give an example where if we had just in the beginning encouraged Snapchatters to add all their friends in the contact book instead of just a few of them, they might feel really uncomfortable creating Snaps and adding them to their Story, because they wouldn't know who was actually watching.", "So, ultimately, I think the way that we try to help people understand how we think about daily active user growth is really through the lens of creativity and creation, because we built our entire business on creation.", "So one of the things I think we've talked about a lot is this idea that anytime someone creates a Snap, they typically either send it to their friend which brings that friend into the Snapchat ecosystem; or they add it to their Story which obviously contributes to time spent as they provide that content to all their friends.", "And so, I think the most important thing to understand is that really we think of this daily active user growth as a function or a derivative of the growth in creation. And so we're really excited about the momentum there.", "And then I think we also talked about two things that are really important to the growth of our service. The first is affordable cell service, broadband cell service and decent to high-end smartphones. So historically we've really focused our efforts on markets where both of those are available because we can really deliver value through our products that way. So I think we think, over time, as connectivity grows, that more people will be able to use our products and really get value from them.", "So the last thing I will say is that the way we talk about DAU growth in our Company really as it pertains to creativity is about removing friction from the creative process. So we've talked about Lenses which I think are a great product. And the reason why I think that that prompted such an explosion in creativity is because it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service, because people enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that.", "So another example we gave recently was the improvements to our Android product. And so I think the more we're able to reduce friction from the creative process by improving the way our camera works in terms of Creative Tools and also just functionality, more people will feel empowered to express themselves. And I think we believe that that translates to DAU growth.", "Drew Vollero", "Mark, as it relates to your question on guidance, whether it's DAUs or peak EBITDA losses, we're going to run the Company here for the long term. We want the flexibility to make the right decision in the long term. So we're not going to be short sighted about profit decisions to make a quarter or whatever that would end up being. So at this point, there is not going to be any financial guidance coming from Snap.", "Mark Mahaney", "Thank you, Evan. Thank you, Drew.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Evan, just one follow-up on the DAU and then one for either Imran or Drew. So it sounded like the Android activations are picking up. So I guess the question is, why isn't the rest of world region keeping pace with maybe the historical trend that you've seen in that geo or what you're seeing right now in North America and Europe, with around 3 million added each quarter?", "And then do you expect that to pick up at some point in the future? And any color -- you guys just launched the World Lenses product about a month ago, so any initial read on how that uptake has been going. And that I have one follow-up.", "Evan Spiegel", "Sure. So I think the connectivity issue is a real problem in the developing world, because it really changes the use case of our service and the behavior of people that use Snapchat.", "So, for example, in certain developing world markets, people tend to use their Wi-Fi at home or in an Internet Cafe because the broadband cell service is so expensive. And what that means is that you can't use Snap to communicate in the moment. You have to go use Snap at a wireless Cafe. And that turns Snap into much more of a broadcast, lean back kind of service.", "And so I think we can invest in growing those sorts of products in those markets. But the way that our service works, I think, is by empowering this sort of visual communication. And that is just really tough if you don't have cell service wherever you go.", "Ross Sandler", "Got it, okay. And then the question for Imran or Drew is just on the revenue breakdown. The $150 million, can you just -- Drew, you mentioned that both the Creative Tools and Snap Ads were growing rapidly. Can you just give us a little sense on how much of that came from those two buckets and where we're today on ad load for discover?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think -- look, we built the best mobile ad product. I fundamentally believe that. If you look at our Snap Ad product, they are full screen; they play with sound. And if you look at our sponsored Creative Tools -- those are the Lenses and Filters -- people are actually putting it on their pictures and videos and sharing with their friends. So they are -- that actually has very superior ROI that we have seen with many, many advertisers. And both of those sponsored Creative Tools and our Snap Ads are contributing meaningful revenue. We're not breaking those down at this point.", "With regards to ad load, look, we're very, very early days. If you look at -- as Evan mentioned, we now have more than 3 billion Snaps get created on our platform. I talked about how we have our average users are spending 30 minutes -- more than 30 minutes on our platform. So we're just scratching the surface in terms of ad load.", "Ross Sandler", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "I have one for Evan and one for Imran, if I can. Evan, when you think about the creative process behind product development, how much of this focus is really on products for your core audience versus products perhaps for a more mass audience, including older demographics? Maybe you can give us a sense of what you're seeing from those folks in terms of today and what products might be in the pipeline that appeal more to older audiences.", "And then, Imran, wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of adoption around the self-service platform and in particular around direct response versus brand advertisers. Do you see evidence that the mix is increasingly shifting more to the DR side? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of the way we develop product, the important thing to understand is that we're always trying to do our best to build products that are universally appealing. So things like talking with pictures or telling Stories, those are the things that we really believe are universally appealing.", "Although we do tend to market our products directly to younger people because, frankly, they are more interested in learning how to use new technology products. And that's sort of -- is partly inspired by trying to teach my grandma how to use email; and she'd really prefer to just talk on the phone. So I think now a lot of grandparents are using email, but 20 years ago it was a little different.", "And so I think, over time, that strategy has worked for us. This quarter, the 25-plus demo, time spent in sessions are up and it continues to be a larger portion of our audience. So I really do believe we've done a good job delivering products with universal appeal, even if they are initially adopted by people who are excited about new ways to use cameras and communicate.", "Imran Khan", "Yes and with regards to self-service, our journey for self-service started in October of last year when we launched our API. Now we have 24 API partners. And in Q1, 20% of our Snap Ad impressions were served through the API platform. So that is pretty -- we're very pleased with that adoption within six months of launching the product.", "And the self-service, we announced last week that we make it available. We're very excited about the initial reaction and excitement about this product. It will be broadly available first week of June, so I think it's too early to comment about it.", "With regards to DR versus brand, I think we took a deliberate approach to start our business with the brand advertising. And the reason is we've listened -- we heard from our advertisers that there was not enough good solutions for brand advertising on the mobile. And a lot of the brand advertisers are also the very large advertisers and they have very high standards. So I think by proving the ROI to the large brand advertisers, we have been able to create a very good, strong, mobile app product on the marketplace.", "We have been making great progress on the DR side. In the call, I talked about the example of Acorn where they saw a 300% increase; or Fullscreen were testing very healthy customer acquisition costs. We're seeing more and more DR customers adopting our platform and seeing great result.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.", "Eric Sheridan", "Maybe two, both around long term strategy and shorter term, as well, on the hardware side. Evan, would love to get your sense of how you think about hardware that needs to be made by Snap itself versus leveraging, especially areas like AR and VR that we might see from third parties, sort of a follow-up on Mark's question from earlier. And then one around the financials. With the step-down in revenue quarter over quarter, Q1 over Q4, is there any way you could call out the impact that Spectacles might have had in that step-down, quarter over quarter? Thanks, guys.", "Evan Spiegel", "I think in terms of our hardware strategy, our approach when we're exploring new technology is to usually work on it ourselves. So if you remember back even when we started building Publisher Stories, we really created a lot of our own content. And that's usually the best way for us to explore something really, really quickly and really learn from it. And so that's been our strategy.", "Today with Spectacles, I think it's been really exciting to see people capture memories from their perspective. There's obviously something really exciting about that. Over, I guess, 5 million Snaps have been created with Spectacles to date. And so I think we're going to keep experimenting there. And then at some point obviously, I think as we've shown with our other products, we like being a good partner and I think that's always an interesting avenue to explore.", "Drew Vollero", "So, financially, Eric, on the Spectacles side again, we launched the Spectacles.com website during the quarter. It's a modest program for us right now. We report that in other revenue. We don't break out Spectacles, per se, but it was a little more than $8 million for the quarter.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "I had two; first one for Imran. Can you just talk about what kind of content you're looking for on the Snap platform and how you ensure that you get the discoverability of that video or content in what's becoming a more crowded discover tab?", "And then second, drew, just understanding that there's seasonality, of course, in 1Q in brand spending. You're also just very early in your trajectory. But is there anything else to think about here as we go through 2017, in terms of seasonal or other kinds of comp issues through the year? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "I'd actually love to take this opportunity to talk a little more broadly about our content strategy in general. The simple answer to the discoverability problem for our publishers to date has been really the application of machine learning which has really helped us show the right content to the right person in terms of the Publisher Stories content.", "But I think more broadly, we have really three great types of content on our service. The first obviously, the user Stories product that we initially created where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and they don't feel like they're part of a popularity contest. And I think that product has been really terrific.", "And I think after that, obviously, we developed Publisher Stories. And Publisher Stories I think are really interesting because we were able to really create an ecosystem that works where publishers have an incremental audience where they can monetize their content; but also build a relationship with the customers that are viewing that content that we've seen also impact their business outside of the Snap ecosystem. And that relationship is really, really important to us. And we have a loyalty metric that we share with those partners because I think they've really been able to build a relationship on Snap.", "And then I think the last one that's really fun for us and is really a new one, are the new Stories that are being created in our search product. And that's really exciting because people all over the world are experiencing really fun things. And just by contributing their Snap to Our Story, we do all the hard work on the back end to basically collect all these perspectives together, compile them into interesting Stories that everyone can enjoy. So I think this is yet another type of relationship that's being built on Snap where people around the world are seeing things from new perspectives.", "So, I think, broadly speaking, the content strategy is working well. And then I think we have some other things we're interested in, in building on in the future.", "Drew Vollero", "On the second part of your question, obviously the business is scaling quite rapidly. We were up 286% year-over-year, if you look at the revenues. As you look at the back half of the year, obviously we're building an international business. We have a salesforce now that's really starting to get traction.", "There were a couple of the events in the back half of 2016 from a seasonal perspective. We did have the Olympics in the third quarter of 2016. That was a nice bump for us. And then in the fourth quarter, we have good partnerships with college football and the NFL on the sporting side. And so you can think about that a little bit. There also was a little bit of election upside, as well, in 2016.", "But, overall, the business is just in a very different place in terms of the resources and the size of the reach that we have right now with the salesforce.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Nowak", "I have two; the first one to Evan. There is very strong engagement and time spent on the platform, but the ad deceleration was pretty steep. You talked about removing friction in engagement. I'd be curious to hear about what are the main points of friction that you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars onto the platform? What excites you most to fix that over the next couple years? And then on discover, can you just talk about the type of engagement or user adoption you're seeing on discover and what are the main ways you can drive faster discover adoption? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, sure. I think the big issue with advertising over the next decade or so, frankly, is going to be education. I think we have world-class ad units. They are delivering ROI. We've done a lot of work this year to build out the measurement side of the business. And so I think now really it's an education process and I think early adopters are seeing great results. And so we've just got to keep showing people how Snap can really work for them and drive ROI.", "And then -- sorry. As far as the discover content is concerned, I think one of the things we're really excited about is our new Shows product. I don't know if you had a chance to see it, but basically it is total -- it is content created just for Snap. So rather than a lot of the video content you're seeing I think on mobile right now which is repurposed from TV or repurposed from the Internet, we've worked with some really outstanding partners to create some awesome shows.", "And I think right now, we have about one show a day. I think that will grow through the end of the year. And these are episodes like -- Second Chance, I think what was on today; and these are the types of shows that are drawing audiences over 8 million. So we're excited about that.", "Brian Nowak", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju", "Imran, it seems like you have around 11 office locations right now around the globe. It seems like the vast majority of those are in the U.S., as well as the English-speaking countries. So, when can we start to see you guys start to go more aggressively after the other large ad markets in Continental Europe and elsewhere, so that we will start seeing the monetization gap between North America and Europe close? It seems like the users are catching up, but the revenue in Europe still seems to be about 1/10th of what you're reporting in North America right now. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're very pleased with our international growth. I think if you look at in Q1, 14% of our revenue came from international market. That is up from 7% a year ago. I think we're still early on with many market, like for example in Germany, we're just getting started. We're just getting started in Nordic markets and Netherlands and things like that. So I think as we continue to expand more sellers in those markets and continue to invest, I think you will see international continue to grow as a percentage of revenue.", "Stephen Ju", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.", "Ron Josey", "I just wanted to drill a little bit more into self-service, with 20% of ads delivered through the API in the first quarter and then the pending launch of the ads manager, can you just talk about the roadmap for self-service? The tools appear to be there with support across the ad formats and want to know if Lenses is included. And then how do you manage the channel conflict between Snap's salesforce and an ad manager? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think the -- first of all, 20% of Snap, that is what flowed through the API, not Lenses and Filters. And I think what we're really committed to that it is make it very easy for any advertisers to buy a Snapchat ad. And I think a lot of the large advertisers also want to use our self-service platform because they want to try out different creatives; they want to get more real-time result. And as well as a lot of small businesses who doesn't necessarily have access to sellers or agencies -- they also want to try it out.", "And I think what you will see us that over the next year or two and on an ongoing basis, is a continued investment to make it as frictionless as possible for everybody to buy ad on our platform.", "And with regards to channel conflict, the way we manage our channel conflict is the sellers have their clienteles and we got list that clienteles what platform and how they buy ads on the platform; they get credited towards that. So we have a pretty good -- we feel very good about the channel conflict management on that.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.", "Scott Devitt", "I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about geographic mix in terms of user growth. North America and Europe continue to outperform rest of world in terms of absolute DAU adds and how to think about that throughout 2017 and future years. And then secondly, just a clarification on the Spectacles revenue that Eric asked about earlier. Could you give the number of -- for Spectacles in 4Q? And then also in 1Q just to make sure -- understood what that $8 million was -- which quarter that was in. Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Yes, on the Spectacles side, just as a quick clarification, other revenue in the fourth quarter was I think a little bit more than $4.5 million. And so the numbers I gave earlier to Eric were first quarter other revenues were a little bit more than $8 million. So that will give you a little context. And really the program began in the fourth quarter.", "Evan Spiegel", "And as far as DAU growth, we're going to continue to focus on North America and Europe where we think we can deliver the most value for customers, based on their devices and the network. And longer term, obviously, we really believe that Snapchat is for everyone. And it's just early days for us, so we're focused in North America and Europe first.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.", "John Blackledge", "Two questions. Evan, in terms of the upcoming product roadmap, could you maybe discuss what you're excited about and perhaps how you see the cadence of product innovations progressing throughout the course of the year?", "And then maybe for Imran, you mentioned Universal doubled ad spend, 2016 versus 2015. Just your thoughts on ad demand in the U.S. in 1Q -- were you pleased with it? And then how is ad demand trending, thus far in 2Q? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "So I think at this point, we're kind of famous for not giving guidance on the product pipeline. But we're obviously really excited about it and we love surprising our community; so should be a fun rest of the year.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to ad business in Q1, I was very pleased with our Q1 ad performance. And I think, as you know, that our business has more focus on brand advertisings. That's how we got started and the brand business is very seasonal. But if by that on a year-over-year basis our business grew 286% on a year-over-year basis.", "And we continue to invest in both DR and brand and continue to make the advertising business as frictionless as possible which will help us to onboard many, many advertisers on the platform which should bode well for our future advertising business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.", "Heath Terry", "On the DAU number, can you unpack for us a little bit? A DAU, daily active user, is obviously an incredibly high bar. Can you unpack for us a little bit how much of the growth came from adding additional users to the platform versus engaging -- increasing engagement on the platform? And then from an advertising perspective, was there any impact to the quarter from changes in the sales organization or any sort of disruption there that you felt like would have allowed the Company to potentially grow advertising faster, had you seen more stability in the quarter?", "Imran Khan", "Look, I'm not sure what sales organization change you are mentioning; but I think we continue to grow our sales organization and continue to add a lot more people in the organization. And that continues to do very well. I think we're very fortunate to hire a lot of great talent in the organization throughout the quarter. And I think the salesforce is -- remained really very focused. And I'm very pleased with the execution we're doing. Evan, do you want to take DAU?", "Evan Spiegel", "I think we talk a lot about DAU as an engagement metric. Obviously we provided a couple extra metrics this quarter, like time spent which is over 30 minutes. And obviously an overall increase in sessions on a per user basis, so those are things we're excited about. And as I mentioned, I think the more that we can remove friction from this creative process, the more people want to use our service. And that's our strategy.", "Heath Terry", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Mark Zuckerberg opened up F8 essentially saying that they are now a camera company with an augmented reality API designed to let the whole world in and innovate. And while he didn't ever say it directly, it really sounded like he wants to bury Snapchat. So, I think the question that's on every investor's mind is does Facebook scare you, why or why not? And then I have a follow-up for Imran.", "Evan Spiegel", "Look, I think if there's one thing that I'd want to communicate today, it's probably just the overall importance of creativity to our business. And I mean this from every perspective, from the team that we hire to how they work together; the creative culture that we have; the products that we have that inspire people to create. And I think our overall strategy, obviously which is to deliver value through creativity. And I think the bottom line is, like, if you want to be a creative company you've got to get comfortable with and basically enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your products if you make great stuff.", "And I think we've seen this happen a lot in technology. When Google came along, everyone really felt like they needed a search strategy. When Facebook came along, everyone felt they needed a social strategy. And now I think with Snap, with our company, we believe that everyone is going to develop a camera strategy. Because I think we really help people understand how valuable the camera is, because it's really the center of everything that we do. And I think, at the end of the day, just because Yahoo, for example, has a search box, it doesn't mean they are Google.", "Richard Greenfield", "So just to follow up on the advertising side, either for you, Evan or for Imran. Why should an advertiser, just given the magnitude of the scale of Facebook versus Snapchat -- not to mention the advertising tools -- why advertise on Snapchat versus just dumping more money into Facebook?", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, I think a bunch of reasons. Number one, we have incremental audience that we talked about. Number two, we're created -- I would argue that probably the best mobile ad product on the marketplace which is what many, many, many of our advertisers are seeing, superior ROI.", "Third, I think, fundamentally, advertisers want to advertise in many different platforms so that they can reach the -- advertise at different context. And fourth, we also have a very difficult to reach audience and a very, very engaged audience, as we talked about in my prepared remarks. All advertising starts with a strong engagement and we provide incredibly strong engagements. An average user is spending more than 30 minutes on the platform. So all of those reasons I think is very, very attractive to advertisers to be on our platform.", "Richard Greenfield", "Thank you for the answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.", "Mark May", "Just a DAU question again. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on the month-to-month trends, how you exited the quarter and early Q2. And maybe just remind us a little bit of the seasonality of your user growth and user engagement.", "And then in terms of host costs per DAU, I was under the impression those were largely a function of engagement. But you said that that wasn't necessarily the case in Q1. You talked about some savings from what you're doing on the partner and side. Should we expect that those kind of savings to continue at least for the foreseeable future? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, look, in terms of guidance, we don't want to give intra quarter guidance. As you know that advertising business is a seasonally -- seasonal business, where Q1 is seasonally weaker. And so our business will continue to face seasonality that we see on the broader advertising market. With regards to -- I think one of the things I keep want to highlight that I have been feeling very strongly about our ad business. Again, I think in addition to the ROI we're driving for advertisers, we're also providing a lot of powerful location data. So people Snapchat as a messaging app and people open the app many times. You see a lot incredible amount of location data and that's also very, very valuable. That's also driving a very strong ROI for everything -- in addition to everything I just talked about.", "So we feel very good about our advertising business. And beyond that, I can't really comment specific to the quarter.", "Mark May", "I was talking about the DAU seasonality, how to think about that in Q2 and seasonality combined with how you exited the quarter DAU. Seasonality.", "Imran Khan", "Again, I think if you look at our business, our user growth was driven by innovation. And as we continue to improve the performance and quality, that also driving the DAU growth. And I think in terms of beyond that, I don't think we should think too much about seasonality on that.", "Drew Vollero", "So as it relates to cost of revenue and your question, cost of revenue was $141 million in the quarter. $99 million of it is hosting costs. Another $23 million is revenue share, so those really are the two primary components of what drive it.", "Hosting costs are paid directly to our third-party infrastructure providers. We have primary business with Google and we've also brought Amazon over as well recently. There are a series of headwinds and tailwinds in that business. Growing engagement, to your point and new users cost us more because they are variable cost contracts. The more that consumers use our app -- the more that they open it, the more that they Snap on in, they more they download content, the more that we incur charges.", "So in terms of the prices that we pay for those services, because we signed two new contracts, we got lower prices with both of those providers. And so that provided a significant tailwind for us. And it really was the upside that you saw in sequential costs. Our costs went from $113 million last quarter to $99 million there. And that is in a quarter where we saw significant growth in engagement in some of the main attributes as well as we saw the user growth. You can see we added another 8 million users in the quarter.", "So it really was that offset in pricing that we got from the two contract providers that really drove hosting costs lower. And revenue share is a piece of that. Revenue share was up slightly in the quarter. We had restructured a couple of deals. They are now more fixed-fee deals as opposed to percentage of revenue deals. Those will give us leverage if we're able to grow sales in the back half of the year; but, in the short term, raised our expenses in the first quarter.", "Mark May", "And I guess my question is as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, are you -- is host costs going to more than closely align with DAU and engagement growth? Or some of these cost savings from the new contract is going to continue to be a tailwind for the next couple of quarters?", "Drew Vollero", "The contractual pricing is, going forward, we signed a five-year deal with each of the companies, so it's new pricing that goes forward from this point. As it relates to where it all comes out, as I said, there is a series of headwinds and tailwinds. It really is a function, first and foremost, about engagement and how much engagement happens on the site and how many users that we add. Those really are what drive the costs. In terms of the year-over-year changes in the contract, the contract does have lower prices for our key services as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "A couple questions. Get a lot of questions on competition, so wondering if you can comment at all on churn as you look at your user base in Q4 or Q1. Any notable changes there, either Android or Apple platforms, would help us understand if competition is having any impact.", "And then on advertisers, just any thoughts on -- we saw the sequential decline, but how did you do on adding new advertisers in the first quarter? Did your total number of advertisers grow sequentially in Q1? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Overall, especially in the last half of last year, we had a really tough time with Android. That's still showing up in the numbers, as we mentioned. We added -- roughly 20% of our net adds from Android in Q4 and 30% in Q1. So we're making progress. But it's taking time and we're definitely digging out of a performance hole on Android. The low-hanging fruit, I would say, has been tackled in this past quarter, but we're making some larger structural changes that I think will make a big difference on Android over time.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, with regards to advertising, as we're -- continue to educate the market, one thing to keep in mind there our ad business -- we really start monetizing our business. The first ad ran on Snapchat in Q4 of 2014 and our ad business is still very, very nascent. So as we continue to educate the market, expand the sales force, opening new market, we continue to see more and more advertisers coming to our platform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel.", "Brian White", "Evan, I wonder if you could comment a little bit about the smartphone market. More smartphones are going to come with 3D sensors. It's going to support more AR activities. So I'm wondering how we should think about this as either a threat or an opportunity for Snap. So that's one question. Second question is just long term thoughts on China and also on Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Obviously all these improvements and sensors, et cetera, are really exciting for us and obviously fun to play with. The tough thing with any of these sort of device-specific improvements is that they are really hard for all of our community to enjoy. So instead, we've really invested in building a lot of our own technology that works well with a single camera. So you see that technology in World Lenses; it looks simple, but that surface detection is tricky to do with single-camera devices. And so we invested a lot in making these next-generation AR products available to our user base. But, yes, obviously always excited about new technology.", "And then -- sorry, the second question?", "Brian White", "Just on China. The long term thoughts on China and Japan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, thanks. Sorry about that. In terms of China, we've learned so much from the Chinese market. In the very early days, Tencent invested in our business and we had the chance to spend a lot of time with them. We've always been in awe, frankly, of the innovation happening over there. And that's really as far as our relationship with China has progressed today. But we've invested in building out some engineering there and obviously it's really exciting for our business.", "And then Japan -- obviously a great market and we've been working more recently to develop content that specifically appeal -- Lenses and Creative Tools that appeal specifically to the Japanese market. So that's a market we're excited about over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Maybe a quick one on the infrastructure side of things. You mentioned the deals with Google and Amazon. Maybe thinking about how you feel about the interchangeability between the two services. When you think about how you engineer, do you build stuff in a modular fashion so you can quickly move it over from one cloud to another? And any color or comments around that? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, the thing you're talking about, sort of like containerization, I think is definitely the long term goal with products like this. But the interesting thing about the state of the cloud market today is really how these different providers have entered the market.", "So you have AWS which was really created because Amazon was trying to meet the needs of their customers around Christmastime. They built all this excess capacity and then rented it out. And Google, obviously, who has entered the market and they have a totally different and very specific use case around search.", "And so what ends up happening is that both of these companies build different services. And so, for example, recently we've moved some of our operations to an Amazon data store that's a little bit less redundant than a Google data store, for example, but saves us a bunch of money. So right now, I think we're really picking and choosing the different products we want to use based on the offerings from the two providers.", "But I do think, yes, long term, obviously, the dream for the cloud is this idea of containerization. And that's something we continue to invest in, but that -- that's a sort of a step-by-step, not an overnight kind of thing.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com.", "At times in our prepared comments or in response to your questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Good afternoon and welcome to our Q2 earnings call, we made a lot of great progress this quarter. Snapchaters now visit more frequently, spend more time and create more snaps than ever before, both in aggregate and on per user basis. Daily active user growth remains solid with 173 million people using Snapchat every day on average during the quarter an increase of 4.4% from Q1. ", "User growth was especially strong in North America with 4 million net additional users since last quarter. We also reached and important milestone in our core markets with over 25% of smartphone users in the U.S., UK and France now using Snapchat every day. Monetization is also progressing nicely although we are still in very early stages as we continue to build out our self-service and programmatic infrastructure. ", "Quarterly revenue increased 153% year-over-year to 181.7 million. Adoption of our ad platform is increasing with more than half of our all Snap ad impressions delivered through our self-service platform and our API this quarter. As our automated capabilities improve, we are running more campaigns from more advertisers resulting in a greater variety of ads on our platform. This enables us to build a robust auction and drive more relevant ads yielding better results for our advertisers and a better experience for our community. Additionally, this auction allows advertisers to optimize their campaigns across our inventory to achieve their specific objectives further increasing ROI. ", "At the heart of this growth and engagement daily active users and revenue is the creativity of our community which is one of the things that makes Snapchat so unique. Each one of our daily active users creates over 20 snaps per day on average to express themselves and communicate with their friends. The best part of working with Snap is leveraging the creativity of our communities to build new products like maps, search and memories where we empower Snapchaters to do more with what they create. ", "We found that the best way to grow our business is to build products that inspire our community to create snap like lenses and creative tools and provide new outlets like Custom Stories and Maps, so that our community can share their creations with their friends. When we're able to do both of these things well, we create a virtuous cycle where our community both creates and use more snaps. ", "This quarter, we continued to invest in empowering creativity with new lenses and creative tools. Today, we\u2019re focused primarily on front facing camera effects that augment selfies but this quarter we announced a product designed specifically for the outward facing camera on smartphones, we call this product World Lenses, and we worked hard to build the underlying technology to recognize the world and render interactive objects and experiences on top of it. Its early days but we have had so much fun watching our community interact with World Lenses. ", "Our dancing hot dog is most likely the world's first augmented reality super star, viewed over 1.5 billion times in snaps created by our community. We released several new creative tools this quarter for our community to express themselves and have fun. People can now create custom stickers, use the magic eraser to remove an object, add a playful backdrop or alter the background color of their snaps. Creative tools are particularly important on our platform because we want to empower people to express themselves and communicate visually instead of simply taking a photograph. ", "We have found that when we offer more creative tools, our community creates more snaps. With so many snaps created every day on our service, we want to make sure that our community has many different ways to share their snaps both directly with friends and more broadly with the public. We watched stories in 2013 and have constantly iterated on the product as engagement has grown over the years. ", "We created a new type of story this quarter, Custom Stories. Custom Stories are perfect for occasions like parties, vacations and wedding or really any other time you want to collaborate on a story with a specific group of friends or around a specific location. We've had so much fun watching stories created by our friends with their own special events. ", "This quarter saw more story snap views than ever before both in aggregate and per user, not only with regards to user generated content but also premium content provided by our partners. There are more people watching more publisher stories than ever before with publisher story views increasing 30% quarter-over-quarter. ", "We continue to evolve our celebrated stories format to serve the demand for different types of mobile content experiences. One example of this evolution is the growing popularity of shows on Snapchat. We are working with a number of partners that are embracing this mobile story selling format doubling the number of new shows premiering on our service this quarter and compared to Q1. The engagement around shows is particularly exciting.", "For example, Phone Swap, a new show created through our joint venture with Vertical Networks often sees over 10 million viewers for a single episode putting it on par with some of the most popular shows on television. The success of shows is already extending beyond our service. Phone Swap is getting picked up for television and the Voice on Snapchat was nominated for an Emmy Award. We can't wait to see how shows continue evolve. ", "This quarter we also launched Snap Map, a whole new way to see the world. Snap Map is a traditional map designed to get you where you are going it\u2019s a new site of map for figuring out where you want to go. Since the launch of Snap Map content submitted to our story has increased 30% demonstrating that providing new ways to distribution snaps further incentivizes our community to create more snaps and contribute their point of view.", "Memories is another great example of how we have been able to methodically expand upon a snap creation and consumption experience in Snapchat. Historically Snapchat was always known at least in part to the assembling [ph] nature of the content on our service. Recently however we have been pleased with the growth of our Memories product they allows our community to save their creations and share them at a later date. Now over 250 million snaps are saved to Memories every day creating a great foundation for products that make it easy to reminisce. It's always fun to look back on some of our favorite snaps and we believe that Memories will become an even more important part of the Snapchat experience in the future. ", "We've seen great traction with many of our new products. From lenses and creative tools and inspire snap creation to search maps and memories that provide new ways to view snaps. Although many of these products are in their infancy, we should be able to improve them quickly as our community adopts them and let us know how we can better serve their needs. We love that our community continues to experiment with and embrace new products and we are excited that these new behaviors are driving more engagement on Snapchat. ", "We continue to make progress on Android performance this quarter and we've been able to address most of the low hanging fruit that we believe has impacted the customer experience. The remaining performance improvements will come from larger structural changes to our service that will take some time. This quarter we focused on building systems and processes to ensure that we can maintain quality and performance over the long-term. We've defined key customer facing metrics that we believe directly impact use and engagement and we are working hard to improve them and at a minimum reach parity with our iOS application. ", "We are still on the early stages of making these improvements and I would estimate that we won't begin to see the meaningful results of these efforts until the second quarter of next year. This is an unfortunate side effective of the past pace of innovation that prioritizes product execution over the architectural integrity of our software. We've made some great additions to our team this quarter who can help us move as quickly as possible to improve the quality and performance of our service and we are looking forward to making more progress. We're committed to delivering a fantastic Android experience to our community.", "As a final note, given the amount of speculation around the lack of exploration I feel it is important to note that Bobby and I will not sell any of shares this year. The company will withhold the shares needed to satisfy our few tax of holding obligations. We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap. ", "Thanks again for joining us today. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Imran and Drew for some business and financial highlights.", "Imran Khan", "Thanks, Evan. We made great progress this quarter on the monetization side. Advertising revenue increased 146% year-over-year and 25% quarter-over-quarter. Our community grew to an average of 173 million daily active users. This growth was primarily driven by users in the U.S. and Canada with over 40% of our net ads in Q2 coming from these countries.", "Today we have over 69 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada which are two of the most monetizable markets in the world. Together these two countries represent half of all global mobile advertising spent, our traction in core markets like the U.S. and Canada puts us in a great position as we would scale our monetization by allowing our advertisers to leverage our platforms to reach. ", "For example, an advertiser wanting to reach 13 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. would access our publicly available ad manager tool and reach 75% of the total U.S. population in that age group over the course of a multi week campaign. As Evan mentioned we're seeing incredible engagement from our community, which is very exciting for our advertising business. ", "For example, story snap views are higher than they had ever been before. This is important because it generates more inventory and we know advertisers have demand for competing formats like our full screen video Snap ads. An average daily active user that plays with Lenses spends over three minutes doing so daily creating a unique opportunity for advertisers to get lots of engagement with a sponsor lens. This strong growth and engagement trends from our community will allow us to keep scaling our advertising business in the future.", "We remain focused on three key areas that I outlined last quarter. First, enhancing our ad offerings for both brands and direct response advertisers. Second, developing efficient tools for our advertisers. And third, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. ", "First, enhancing our ad offerings; building ad products that solve a variety of advertisers' business objective is a key priority for us. Over 75% of the top 100 adage leading national advertisers spent on our platform last quarter. And what's more important our existing customers are spending more money with us. In fact, revenue from advertisers on a parent level that spent with us in the first half of 2016 grew 142% year-over-year during the first half of 2017.", "Despite significant investment growth by our existing partners we still have a lot more room to grow. The recent launch of our self-service platform will help us not only tap in to additional spend from our existing advertiser base but also on board long tail and mid tail advertisers. We expect this combination of increasing spend by existing advertisers and increasing our advertiser count will help us drive solid revenue growth in the future. ", "This quarter we also expanded our global capabilities with our ads now available in 10 additional countries including Hong Kong, India and Israel. With this expansion, our advertisers can reach users in 39 different countries. ", "I would like to share an example of how we have worked with one partner, Time Warner, to become a larger part of their strategy. Time Warner was an early adopter of our platform who went from experimenting on our platform to scaling that investment across all of our products and offerings. ", "On the advertising side, we've worked with their movie studio Warner Brothers on 48 movie releases since 2015. Most recently we've partnered with them on the release of Wonder Woman. We helped them reach Snapchatters in 26 countries globally. They used a multi-product approach to drive great results including Geofilters, Lenses and the Snap Ad web view Attachments with a custom-built game. On average Snapchatters spend nearly one-minute engaging with this ad. Overall, the campaign was highly effective with more than half of Snapchatters exposed to both the Snap Ads and lenses, said they were likely to see the film in theaters. ", "On the content side, two of Time Warner's companies, CNN and Bleacher Report were among our first publishers when we launched Discover in January of 2015. We worked closely with them to create engaging and effective content for our community. Both brands have seen great success to-date. On Snapchat alone, CNN and Bleacher Report have global monthly audiences of over 12 million and 16 million respectively. ", "It's also important that we offer ad formats to help solve direct response objectives. I want to talk about the progress we've made here which we are very pleased with. Here're two examples of how Snap Ads with Attachments, our direct response product continues to perform well. ", "First, The Economist used our Snap Ads with Attachments product to launch their first UK campaign in June. The campaign was a huge success. The average cost per lead on Snapchat was \u00a310.28 compared to \u00a362 on display and six time more efficient cost per lead than their other marketing channels. ", "Second, Active and audience fitness apps, also used our Snap Ads with Attachments product to drive both installed and high-quality users. With this campaign, we are able to deliver users at a 30% lower cost per install than their other channels. But Active wasn't just looking for the lowest price, they were also looking for strong engagement, that's why we are thrilled that the users they acquired were highly engaged with Active audio workout programs. ", "Another area we continue to invest in is to allow advertisers to reach exactly the audience they want to reach. For example, a simple [ph] looking to advertise to both parents and young adults can leverage several of our targeting capabilities to ensure they reach the most relevant audience. They can use a combination of our native targeting capabilities called Snap Lifestyle category to reach family travelers, as well as our third-party data to reach family vacationers. This allows them to reach more than 8 million Snapchatters in the U.S. They can also narrow in on married moms over the age of 35 who control household budgets, and audience segments that we call money minders and reach over 4 million Snapchatters with real buying power. We're very excited that we can offer lower prices combined with high engagement, a winning combination that continues to drive our advertising business. ", "The second area that we remain focused on is developing efficient tools for our advertisers; in order to scale our advertising business, we need to make it easy for any and all advertisers to buy on our platform. 60% of Snap Ads impressions are now being delivered programmatically, more than doubled from last quarter. Because we're still in early stages of monetization we're focused on onboarding as many advertisers as possible. Advertisers can bid for desired business objectives like apps installs or video views and our platform will optimize that delivery in real time. Increasing automation on our apps platform is driving better ROI for our advertisers. In fact, for our app install advertisers, the average cost per app install has decreased 80% since the launch of our auction. Over time though, we expect the auction dynamic and increased demand to drive up pricing levels. Our focus in coming months will be making it even easier for advertisers to find exactly what they are looking for on our self-service platform. ", "And finally, the third area of focus is further proving the effectiveness of our advertising. Over 90% of retail transactions still happen in physical stores. Advertisers are very egger to measure the effectiveness of their digital spending in the real world. That\u2019s why in June we announced the acquisition of location based analytics and ad measurement company called Placed. With Placed we will be able to measure activities such as store visits and offline purchases that prove digital ads are driving real value for advertisers. Placed is one of many measurement partners that we work with including Nelson, Oracle Data Cloud, Newster, [indiscernible] Moat and several others. We're committed to working with the best third-party measurement companies to provide transparency to our advertisers. ", "Our investments in creating an offline sales measurement ecosystem are paying off. I would like to share measurement results from three different industry categories that show our advertising is driving profit for our customers. ", "First, in the retail apparel category Snapchat drove a ROAS or return on app spend that was 2.7 times the average ROAS across all online and offline media spend for best category as measured by Newster market share. ", "Second, in the movie theatrical release category, Snapchat drove a ROAS that was 5.1 times the average ROAS for all media spend as measured by Newster market share.", "And third, Snapchat drove an average ROAS of $3.53 at gross 16 consumer packaged goods campaign. This outperformed the average ROAS of $2.58 for mobile advertising campaigns for Q4 of 2016 as measured by Nielsen Catalina Solutions. ", "We\u2019re very pleased with what we've accomplished in the first half of the year, looking ahead we're going to stay focused on scaling our adverting business and investing in the right areas to succeed in the long-term. ", "Thank you everyone for the time and now I will hand it over to Drew. ", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results featured growing revenues and expanding gross margins with continued investments in people and acquisitions. ", "In the quarter, we made strong progress against our three financial goals which are designed to pave our path to profitable growth and prioritize strategic investments along the way. As a quick reminder, we\u2019re focused on executing these financial strategies. ", "First, driving both revenue and ARPU growth while expanding gross margins; second, moderating capital intensity to ensure strong EBITDA to free cash flow conversion and third, investing in front house resources and M&A to build rapid scale in innovation and monetization. ", "Let me build on incremental revenues and growing gross margins. In the quarter, revenues grew 153% year-over-year to $181.7 million and grew 21% sequentially. Looking regionally, revenues in North America were $147.6 million up 126% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Revenue outside North America showed nice progress. Total international revenues were $34.1 million or 19% of sales up from 9% a year ago and 14% sequentially. ", "Looking across the product line revenue from both Creative Tools and Snap Ads increased year-over-year and sequentially. In the quarter revenue increases were driven by substantial gains in ad impressions partially offset by lower Snap Ad pricing. Impression gains were higher for both Creative Tools and Snap Ads. As Imran noted more than half of Snap Ads were served by auction more than double from last quarter. The mixed shift fueled solid growth in Snap Ad impressions but this mix shift also resulted in lower Snap Ad blended pricing as we moved from selling reserved inventory at set prices to selling unreserved inventory at auction rates. ", "Our goal overtime would be to try Snap Ad pricing higher through strong auction participation and improved targeting. Across the company Snap sold revenue was a $164.8 million, partner sold revenue was $11.5 million and other revenues were $5.4 million substantially all of which was driven by spectacles. ", "Average revenue per user or ARPU was a $1.05 in the second quarter up from $0.50 a year ago and up from $0.90 in Q1. North America remains a leading indicator for the potential of the business and North American ARPU was a $1.97 up 85% versus last year and up 9% sequentially.", "Consistent with our first strategy, gross margins grew nicely in the second quarter. Please note that when I discuss expense figures and gross margins, they will exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization.", "Gross margins grew to 19% in Q2 up 5,100 basis points from the year ago and 1,400 basis points sequentially. Gross margins benefitted from three key drivers. First, strong profit flow through from incremental ad dollars; second, stable hosting cost per user and third, cost leverage on revenue share expenses. ", "In the quarter user engagement, time spend, snaps created and other metrics grew nicely. But our engineering saving initiatives nearly offset all of those cost increases. Sequentially user hosting cost rose only slightly from $0.60 per user in Q1 to $0.61 in Q2. ", "Additionally, revenue share expenses fell sequentially from 16% of sales to 13% of sales due to the expanded monetization of products without revenue shares such as My Story. Overall the scale potential of our financial model is starting to take shape. Measuring year-over-year we've seen over 50% flow through in our incremental sales to gross margin dollars. But sequentially we saw an 83% flow through in the quarter at a $32.0 million increase in sales drove $26.7 million in incremental gross profit dollars. ", "We made strong progress against our second financial strategy which is to moderate the capital intensity of our business. Our primary lever remains our cloud hosting strategy where we rely on partner expertise, their scale and capital to serve our customers. ", "We continue to see both competitive cost to serve at $0.61 in the second quarter and a competitive advantage on our capital spending. Capital expenses in the quarter were modest and consistent at $19.4 million primarily driven by facility expansion to support our growing organization. For the last 12 months, our CapEx was $75 million which is less than $0.50 per current user, well below what other company spend. ", "We made good progress on our third financial strategy which is to make investments in the front of house resources in M&A to rapidly scale innovation and monetization. In the quarter headcount grew from 2,360 to approximately 2,600 including acquisitions. 90% of the new hires were in engineering and sales similar to Q1.", "Overall, operating expenses increased 17% sequentially to $228.7 million due to higher personnel cost. Annualized cost per employee were pretty consistent but up slightly versus prior periods at $351,000 per employee. We made additional investments in M&A which the company will do selectively. ", "During the quarter, we spent slightly more than $200 million in cash with some other performance considerations. In it remarks Imran spoke to the strategic benefits of our recent acquisitions have placed. Please note the company was acquired in July so we reflect that acquisition in our Q3 financials.", "Overall, net loss was $443.1 million for the quarter which included expected stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes of $242.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $194.0 million compared to a loss of $188.2 million in Q1 and a loss of $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. ", "We remain in a strong cash position, cash and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter was $2.8 billion. As of June 30, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1.181 billion and 1.446 billion on a fully diluted basis. ", "Recently with the expiration of the lockup, RSUs [ph] were settled for employees between March 2, 2017 and July 29, 2017. As a result, we withheld from employees approximately 7.8 million shares or around 105 million based on the July 28, 2017 closing price. The tax payments were funded from cash on hand. The shares are no longer considered outstanding for accounting purposes. As future employee shares vest, we will periodically evaluate this net settled share strategy. ", "As we move forward we wanted to share some thoughts on the balance of 2017. With respect to the seasonal trajectory of the advertising revenue in the prior year, our Q3 2016 results benefited from demand related to the summer Olympics and elections. Normalizing for those increases our revenue grew $39 million from Q2 2016 to Q3 2016.", "For hosting expenses, we experienced a substantial increase in time spent in Q2 coinciding with the Maps product launch. Increased time is a strategic benefit for our business, but we pay more for additional usage. Late in Q2 hosting cost per user increased around 10% or so versus the Q2 run rate. ", "Finally, our Q2 hiring pace was slow in the recent quarters, in the short term we plan to apply a similar approach in pace as we focus organic hiring from early on engineering in sales, but keep in mind hiring can be lumpy from quarter-over-quarter. Future acquisitions will likely be additive to the current pace. ", "With that I would now like to turn the line back over to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I can, one on Ad product and one on engagement, first on Ad product, wondering what you're seeing from the ramp in API buying the roll out of self service and just better measurement and targeting. Are you seeing a real tangible response from these tools such that you think you can kind of scale meaningfully in the second half from your largest advertisers? ", "And then second one maybe for Evan, with the new product rolling out across search and maps, wondering if you can elaborate on what kind of uptake you're seeing here whether this is driving really more engagement or DAU growth, you just indicated engagement really picked up recently, maybe you can elaborate on that? Thanks.", "Drew Vollero", "I'll take the first question and Evan will take the second, so we're very excited about the traction we saw from our self-service and API, just to remind everyone that we launched our API in October and self-service was launched in Q2 and we've already seen in Q2 60% of all Snap Ad buying -- Snap Ad impressions were delivered to our self-service and API platform, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment for such a really since such a short period of time. ", "And we're also seeing that our direct response advertisers are seeing good traction, so are all brand advertisers. In my prepared remarks, I talked about how cost per install have decreased 80% since the launch of our app install business; so, we're very-very excited and we think there's a great opportunity to scale the business as we brought in more-and-more advertisers on the platform.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, to your product question, we're obviously super excited about maps, it's early days. I don't have any additional metrics to share beyond what I mentioned earlier, but I think the most important thing for us as it pertains to maps, is introducing the concept that maps can be used for discovery and not just for directions and so really excited that people are using our map to learn about the world. ", "I think the other thing that\u2019s important to note is that maps is a great example of how we can use all the different unique pieces of Snapchat to make a totally new product. So, for example, maps combines our intimate front graph, emojis and also our story, as all the story submissions from all over the world to create a product that's obviously very complex, but yet really simple to use. So, I think maps is a great example of the innovation that really leverages the product foundation we've built over the years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Andrew [indiscernible] on for Ron. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you guys help us understand engagement with Search on Snapchat, now that we're six months into the product? ", "And then with the Snap certified partners program that you guys announced in June, how are you guys balancing that with the sales force, can you just help us understand the [indiscernible] how you're dealing with that? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, so again I think early days on search as people are learning that they can search for stories and not just their friends, the pre-type experience that we've when you tap into search is a really important part of that learning process and I think we're getting better at showing really interesting content depending on who you are, so for instance baseball -- you see a bunch of baseball stories and also teaches, concepts that there's a story for everything, so, early days there but I think it's a great opportunity.", "Imran Khan", "With regards to the channel conflict we view our sales force as a consultant for our partners, so their job is to educate the market, how to buy ad and how to leverage our platform to deliver the ROI for them, and we want to make it incredibly easier for them to buy ad on our platform however they want to, so they can buy directly through insertion order or they can use our certified partners or they can come to our self-service platform and buy through that. So, I think our self-service gets credit regardless how the client buys on our platform but their job is to educate the market and solving the clients' business problem and which they are doing a great job. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Brian Nowak ", "The first one on the ad monetization, I know it's very early in the monetization but can you just talk about some of the main points of friction, you still you have to remove to draw more advertising dollars on the platform and specifically around the API and the self-service, just talk to what you have to change to really drive faster growth there. ", "And then the second one, could you talk about some of the structural change that you had to make to improve the Android product over the next year? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "I think first of all I think it's important to recognize that we launched the self-service in Q2 and so I think we're still early days, but I think few things we have to work on, number one, onboard more advertisers, make it even easier for people to buy on our platform, now people can buy static image ad on our platform and other kind of things, the third thing is we need to train people how to leverage our platform, every platform is different and what works in one platform, not necessarily work in other platform, so working on the education process. So those are the few things that we're working through it. As you saw we've onboarded quite a significant amount of static ad partners on our platform and we continue to do so. But we\u2019re pretty happy with what we\u2019ve seen so far on our self-service platform. ", "Drew Vollero", "I'm hesitant to get for a deepened with the technical stuff but I can give sort of simple example, we started testing its migration last week, migrating our Android application from a text view to a surface view, [indiscernible] so make a huge difference in performance, swiping, camera start, the frame rate of the camera and that\u2019s an example of just a larger structural change. There are a number of changes we're making around threading [ph] any application, it should make a difference but [indiscernible] across the entire platform and so it will necessarily take longer. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Devitt with Stifel. ", "Scott Devitt ", "Imran one for you and Evan one for you, first one as the ad platform continues to be build out, it does seem like the business potentially reaches these points where it can have monetization and selection and ARPU expands very quickly in a short period of time. So, I was wondering Imran if you can explain whether there is any validity that assertion on my behalf and if so, what are the sign post we should be watching for in terms of products that you discussed on the call or otherwise in the ad business to look forward in seeing that over the next six to 12 months. ", "And then secondly for Evan, would just be interested in how content density of location based pictures or the Discovery feature ramping in maps, how that is changing the way that users are posting content to make content more publicly available into Discovery features like that. ", "And then finally without giving away specifics, Evan how do you feel about the product pipeline for the rest of the year? Thank you. ", "Imran Khan", "So, Scott on your first question you're absolutely right and we feel the same way. I think if you look at our business there are multiple drivers, we started our business focusing on large advertisers and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we are seeing. I've talked about how on parent levels things are advertisers are spending on our platform grew 142% year-over-year during the first half of 2017 compared to first half of 2016. ", "One of the big friction point for many advertisers to buy ad on our platform was they wanted a self-service platform access and we launched the self-service platform and we are transitioning our Snap ad buying to our self-service platform and we talked about how 60% of all Snapchat impression buying happened through self-service and API. But as we're bringing more and more advertisers on our auction platform that would be a significant driver for our growth on our platform. So, there is a lot of small business and medium sized business that we need to onboard and that will drive the significant growth for that. So, I think what I'm really-really excited about, what you should think about that continued progress in the self-service and our progress on bringing these S&P businesses on our platform. ", "Evan Spiegel", "As it pertains to maps, obviously I mentioned the increase in submissions to our story which is the publicly available content following the release of maps and I think that's just an example of this virtuous cycle where people when they submit their snaps and they see that\u2019s being viewed by folks all over the world and then they see that you can't grow up in our release products like maps, I think it's sort of self-fulfilling. So very excited about that and sort of excited to continue to expand on these different outlets for creativity for folks on our service. You mentioned sort of the broader product pipeline, very excited about that and this is what we will love to do over here, so we're having a great having time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler ", "I had two questions on ad seasonality and on Discover. Drew, just to follow up you said that last year in 3Q we had the Olympics and the election, currently the street expects about 50% quarter-on-quarter growth in the third quarter and you just did 21% in the second quarter, so given that we won't have seasonality or we won't have the Olympics and election, can you speak to that 50% how comfortably you feel about that.", "And then based on our math, Discover revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter at around $60 million, so just talk about where the ad load is in Discover and if that map is correct, where the acceleration is happening between stories and then the lenses left inside of the app? Thank you.", "Drew Vollero", "Look at couple of levels here, we don\u2019t get into the sales forecasting business so what we try to do is give you visibility to the comp from last year. Equal [ph] last year revenues from 71 million in second quarter last year to 128 million in the third quarter of last year. We did have a nice benefit from the two things that I called out with the summer Olympics and then also we had a little bit of an election bump as well. If you normalize to that, that gain was more like $39 million gains so you can get a sense on sort of the size of that bump in the quarter so we thought that would help provide some perspective as you think about sales in the back half of the year. ", "As it relates to where the advertising is being placed it's hard for me to comment on a particular product line. I will say though that we certainly had a lot of success with Snap-ads broadening them across the platform, you can see that in our revenue share expenses, our revenue share expenses fell 300 basis points and that really was just advertisements being placed more on places where we don\u2019t have revenue share agreements like custom stories. So anyway, that was really the way you can put those pieces together but overall, we saw a good breath of Snap ads across both the Discover platform and the My Story platforms.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thank I'm following up just it's interesting, following up Ross' questions. What for Imran seasonality on Drew on the same question of revenue share expense. So, Imran you said in May [indiscernible] conference had which you considered the company more likely look at an agency or salvation company and seasonality your 3Q, 2Q, 1Q, given your mix is changing in 2Q does is comment still valid or do you think that we're going to see seasonality, it looks more akin to some of your digital peers.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think we're still early. I think if you look at our big brand business is 2-years-old and our self-service business it was just launched in Q2 and while we are very excited about the traction we're seeing and the growth we're seeing but it will take some time to get the equilibrium. And so, it will take some time, so over the years yes seasonality will be more and more muted in the business but it will take some time.", "Michael Nathanson", "And then for Drew, on Ross' last question, what was the last 3 quarters on page 6 on the revenue share cost, its been flat so I know you've done a good job of finding other places to monetize but what can we learn more broadly about the flatness there, what's going on in underline may be usage trends or just selling against whatever there is Discovery I guess past three quarters.", "Drew Vollero", "The big thing to remember about Discover at a high level is it\u2019s a good partnership between the company and the publishers, that business works because both sides of the equation make money. I think we continue to slide an awful lot of ads within the Discover platform. I think the difference over time has really been broadening other avenues for distribution outside of the Discover platform. And so really what you\u2019re seeing is that the revenue gains are being flat at some times on different platforms. ", "There is a little bit that I talked about in the first quarter call as well where we restructured a couple of agreements to these sort of more fixed key arrangements so there is a little bit of something in that well but for the most part really the ability to leverage that expense has being our ability to put advertisements outside of the Discover partnerships as we grow, but first and foremost Discover partnerships we believe our long term partnership and it's important that both sides, both the publishers and the company make money doing that and that\u2019s really what we're focused on first and foremost.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "Douglas Anmuth", "First, you talked about more than 50% of the impression has been coming from the auction and just that it seems lower price Snap ads or is auction is dragging the account. So now that you have more market based price discoveries, is there further risk just Snap ads pricing in the near term and how does that change or alter your direct sales efforts if it does. ", "And then secondly Drew, is there anything that you can talk about just on 4Q, certainly seems like the NFL and holiday should return so I don't think there is anything that normal there but anything to call out as we look deeper into the year. Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, Imran mentioned over 60% of Snap ads were purchased through our auction, which is more than double last quarter and we believe overall that the transition to a bided auction is the best way to grow our business over the long term but you're right, even though pricing is lower in the short term as we're on board more advertisers. I think lower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage, especially in the short term because it provides an incentive for advertisers to get over the hurdle of having to learn how to use Snap, and given the dynamics that we're seeing in the industry in the marketplace, where mobile ad pricing seems to be increasing pretty quickly due to limited impressions, we think that this offering of lower prices and high engagement is really attractive to advertisers and hopefully as we're seeing we'll incentivize them onboard quickly and take advantage of this.", "Drew Vollero", "As it relates to your second question I think you're thinking about the right key drivers seasonally in the fourth quarter of 2016, revenues went from a 128 million to 166 million, our drivers really were at that point that holiday bump that you get. We do have a as you mentioned strong partnerships both the NFL and college football, those really -- their strongest parts are really in that fall season as well, so those are really the two big drivers. We did have a little bump from an election standpoint but not enough to call out, but those are really the two key drivers, we do think there'll be a Christmas in our deals with both the NFL and college football are even deeper partnerships this year. So, I think we should -- I think we'll look forward to the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Another one along the lines of the auction dynamics and how it impacts pricing, just given how quickly the self-service platform has ramped, would you say that the bulk of the pricing pressure that you'll see on the overall business will be largely behind us by the end of the year or is this something that will likely continue to be a headwind for bit longer than that? ", "And then another question, your monetization relative to your public peers is significantly lower, one of the questions that we get is out of the significant daily usage that you have on the platform how much of that is spent doing things that might be more difficult to directly monetize versus activities where you have a real opportunity to monetize?", "Imran Khan", "I think on your second question I think if you go to our self-service platform you can see that a significant portion of our DAU is actually you can reach them through our self-service platform, so these are fairly monetizable audience base. And one of the fact that we don't do growth hacking like notification and things like that, our users actually come to our platform on their own, and they spend a lot of time on it, and that makes a great opportunity to monetize them. ", "And with regards to pricing, look we don't want to get into the guidance but one of the thing is that we are super excited, the kind of ROI that some of our advertisers are seeing on our platform. We're only two years into monetization and we want to onboard as many advertisers as possible on our platform and deliver incredible ROI for them, primarily in an environment when there's not enough mobile video inventory on the marketplace; so we're [indiscernible] with it, where we are with that. Drew, I don't know if you have anything to add. ", "Mark May", "Imran, just to clarify your first answer I wasn't talking about the total users that can be monetized, I was talking about the time that they spend of that 30 minutes plus, how much of that time is spent in activities where you can naturally monetize that activity -- their time...", "Evan Spiegel", "I think yes, this is an important thing to understand about our business obviously we monetize creation with our creation tools, and then that fans out into communication and into our stories products and so in that sense the communication products and the stories product create the audience for their creative tools and obviously we monetize stories with Snap Ads. So, I think you\u2019re seeing the behavior across the platform being monetized, again as Imran's mentioned very early stages. But we're monetizing engagement across the service. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Eric Sheridan ", "May be two, one going back to the auction dynamics, is there any sense you can give us about the pace of growth of breadth in the advertiser base over the last 12 months and how you see that trending over the next 12 months so we can get a bit sense of some of the tail winds around the base of advertisers that are coming into the platform.", "And second, one of the big areas of hiring in the ad sales force, Imran wanted to know if you can give us an update on efficiency in the ad sales team, how that ramps and what that might mean for tailwinds in the business over the next six to 18 months as people get up to productivity. Thanks. ", "Imran Khan", "On your first question, I think we're seeing more and more direct response advertisers are coming to our platform and now that we have self-service, that was one of that biggest ask when you talk to them what they wanted to see from us. And they are coming to our platform and they are seeing great results and we\u2019re pretty pleased with it and we continue to optimize it.", "And I think we launched self-service again in Q2 and we're seeing good start and I think and I'm very excited what possible in terms of number of advertisers on board on our platform. ", "With regards to self-efficiencies, I think as Drew pointed out that in Q2 our head count growth rate moderated significantly, a big reason is moderation in sales and marketing organization and I think what you will see that we expect continue to see improved productivity out of our sales organization as we rolled out all of this efficient buying tools for our advertisers, so I think that should will be a going trend going forward. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ", "Jason Helfstein ", "I just want to dig into scale versus measurement. How much of the friction on the advertiser side is because advertisers want to run more of a display ads that they are running in other platforms as opposed to more engaging video ads that you guys tend to prefer. And then what are those video ads that need to be custom created as opposed to the advertisers are just looking for more and different measurement that you don\u2019t offer. Thanks. ", "Imran Khan", "On the measurement side, I think we made quite a bit of progress. I think vast majority of advertising -- significant portion of advertising that happens on a platform and the big dollar that people spend, there is a measurement attached to it. So, I think advertisers are seeing good ROI from that. I gave quite a few examples that Nelson Catalina or [Newster], the kind of ROI that advertisers are seeing from our platform. ", "We now have more than 15 different third-party partners that we\u2019re partnering with on our platform to providing transparency to our advertisers, we're incredibly committed to provide transparency and I think the kind of results that advertisers seeing on our platform, we want to celebrate them and we want to share that with other advertisers. Can you repeat your first question please?", "Evan Spiegel", "I can take that as it pertains to the creative, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a barrier at all for big brands, I think people are seeing the value of full screen vertical video, it's pretty obvious across the industry. I think the barrier is definitely more of an issue for small businesses and direct response which is why we created the Snap publisher tool that we just released. It's pretty fun to play with, if you want to check it out but you can see how easy it is to create vertical video from all of your existing assets. So, I think that will be really important part of on-boarding more advertisers. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield ", "I've got two questions for Evan. Evan on your first investor call and actually Imran have just mentioned it earlier as well. You have both spoken about how others use growth hacking to inflate DAUs and how it really hurts the platform's relationship with users yet we definitely over the past quarter began to see push notifications from Snapchat essentially alerting us to one of our friends or one of our connections has published a story would you like to go and see it. Wondering despite Imran\u2019s comments earlier, has your philosophy on growth hacking begun to change? ", "And then two, time spent on Snapchat and Instagram based on the recent comments from Instagram it seems like it's fairly similar, but there is a very -- and my sense is there is very little direct messaging that happens on Instagram implying that most of their time spent is actually content consumption. When you think about Snapchat's 30 minutes of usage per day how much of that is actually stories including Discover versus basically communications? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So, on the first question we've been sending notification like that for stories for friends since 2014 so I'm not sure why you are just seeing that now. ", "On the time spent I think time spent is definitely an interesting metric because unlike daily active time spent is zero sum. So for us in Q2 we saw over 40 minutes spent per day for users under 25 and over 20 minutes per day per user over 25 so I think that\u2019s some strong growth for us on the time spent side. ", "We don\u2019t breakout stories versus communications but I think the important thing is we've done a very good job innovating around monetizing communication I think historically that's been challenging for folks so we're really excited about the way we've monetized communication with our creative tools.", "Richard Greenfield", "So maybe just to be clear what exactly is the growth hacking that others do? If you send me push notifications, it's not growth hacking. What are others doing that you consider to be growth hacking and not real DAU growth?", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, I think there are plenty of examples online if you want to go for a Google, but I think the most important thing for us is that when we are telling you about content on a service that is really highly relevant to you and from your very close friends and I think if people as they become more reliant on push notifications to sort of relax the standards there and I think it's important for our business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. ", "Mark Mahaney ", "I\u2019ll still limit myself to one question. Evan you talked about probably not seeing a meaningful impact from these Android innovations changes until the second quarter of next year.", "What is the meaningful impact mean. I think for investors they love to see some sort of inflection up in the rest of world DAUs and maybe that was handicapped by the Android problems over the last year. So is that what we should see? Was that what you meant by a meaningful impact or just describe what you meant? Thanks a lot. ", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, so I think for us meaningful impact -- we definitely look at engagement, we would really like Android users more engage. I think a lot of that is focused on the camera functionality, it's really tough across all the different camera hardware and all these different phones and the different camera APIs, so we really like to see that improve and that's takes a lot of work, obviously because our service is still focused on creation that's something that's really important.", "And I think just because you mentioned the rest of the world DAU I want to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about that because I do think that the market continues to focus on daily active users as a proxy metric for revenue opportunity which is why we always encourage folks to look at the ARPU numbers in our industry across different geos. ", "So just for some examples, looking at other folks in the industry mobile and advertising business as a comp. We have to add more than 10 million daily active users in the rest of world for everyone 1 million daily active users in U.S. and Canada in order to make the same amount of money. So obviously with 10 times of number of users we also incur 10 times the cost, the hosting cost to make the same amount of money. So that would impact the cash flow profile of our business. ", "I think in a way that\u2019s just not a feeling this stage of our business, so I think we look down the road a little bit over the next five to 10 years many of the market but today with those challenges the structure of our business will become more appealing as the more wide markets develop, mobile devices improve and reach parity and faster connectivity becomes cheap and hopefully ubiquitous. So, at that point we'll necessarily focus our growth efforts outside of the core market. ", "I believe that Snapchat is one of our six platforms with over 150 million daily actives outside of China and the other five or so platforms grown by two companies with an aggregate market cap in excess of $1 trillion. So, the reason I say this is to illustrate that we've always been last to market competing against giant companies and we've historically been able to grow our business in markets that are highly competitive and saturated by our competitors because we're so focused on innovation. ", "And so, I think that explains why we are willing take this wait and see approach in markets like the rest of the world that don\u2019t make financial sense for our business at this point, but may make sense in the future. And so, we will continue to reevaluate our opportunities there and keep you posted. ", "Operator", "This concludes our question and answer session as well as today's conference. We thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect. "]}

At this time participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.", "Mr. Arman Panjwani, Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Arman Panjwani", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snap Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Evan Spiegel, CEO; Imran Khan, Chief Strategy Officer; and Drew Vollero, CFO. Earlier today, we made a slide presentation available reviewing our key engagement and financial metrics for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 performance in addition to our financial outlook. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement based on assumptions today. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, and we make no obligation to update our disclosures.", "For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks described in our prospectus dated March 1, 2017, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors. This information can also be found in our other filings with the SEC, when available. Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for Investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends.", "These measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our press release issued today, a copy of which can be found on our website at investor.snap.com. At times in our prepared comments, or in response to questions, we may offer additional metrics to provide greater insight to our business or our quarterly and annual results. This additional detail may be one-time in nature, and we may or may not provide an update in the future on these metrics. Please refer to our filings with the SEC to understand how we calculate our metrics.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Evan.", "Evan Spiegel", "Hello everyone and welcome to the call. Our business really came together towards the end of last year and I am very proud of our team for working hard to deliver these results. We executed well on our 2017 plan to improve quality, performance, and automation, which removed friction from our advertising business and improved our application for the Snapchat community. This translated into annual revenues that grew 104% from the prior year, and 8.9 million Daily Active Users added in the fourth quarter, the highest number of quarterly net adds since the third quarter of 2016.", "All this growth came at a lower cost than the previous quarter. Cash burn decreased 49% from the prior quarter, and gross margin increased 1,400 points sequentially to 36%. These are big improvements that show how quickly Snap can scale when our products and our ad business are working well together. In 2017, we focused on removing friction from our products, our advertising business, and our team. Last year, we talked a lot about our investments in Android and the importance of improving our Android application. Our community has benefited significantly from the changes we have made throughout 2017, and we\u2019re excited to see the impact of this hard work reflected in our Daily Active User growth.", "The retention rate of new Android users increased by nearly 20% when compared to last year, meaning that the people who try Snapchat on Android are much more likely to stick around and become Daily Active Users. Additionally, the fourth quarter saw significantly more new Android users as a percentage of net additional users than any other quarter in our history. It wasn\u2019t just Android that grew because of our efforts. Our growth on iOS continues, and we were honored and excited to end the year with Bitmoji and Snapchat as the number one and number two most popular apps of 2017 in the Apple App Store. Our advertising business changed profoundly over the past year as we migrated the sale of our Snap Ads to an automated auction. Over 90% of Snap Ads were bought programmatically during Q4, which means that the auction transition for Snap Ads is largely behind us. We are learning a lot while operating our automated advertising platform and we are constantly improving the way we sell and serve advertising.", "In Q4, our effective price per impression decreased by 25% while our total advertising revenue grew 38% sequentially. More importantly, we increased advertising impressions by over four times year-over-year while continuing to grow per-user engagement. This demonstrates that our platform can deliver value and efficiency at scale for our advertisers. Over the past two years, we hired over 2,400 people, roughly 100 new team members every month. While it was critical to build our team to keep pace with the growth of our business, it has become clear that we can now unlock substantially more productivity simply by changing the way that we work and by continuing to build an inclusive and creative culture.", "As such, we plan to moderate the growth of our team over the next year and focus on making sure that we have the right team, leadership, and organizational practices in place to support our culture and our mission. We are determined to have a close-knit, hardworking team that is brimming with positive energy and we will continue to make the necessary changes to ensure that everyone at our company is aligned with our values. We ended 2017 confident that we can grow our Snapchat community and monetize our products more efficiently than ever before. With our plans for user growth, augmented reality, and content in 2018, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. We\u2019re going to keep up the hard work and stay focused on the big opportunities ahead.", "Improving application performance is just the beginning when it comes to removing friction so that our community can grow and enjoy Snapchat. We have recently launched partnerships with wireless carriers in over a dozen markets to begin reducing cellular bandwidth costs for Snapchatters around the world. We have seen that when data is less expensive, more people are willing to use our data-intensive products. This is important because Snapchat can be more fun to use out in the world rather than at home on WiFi. We feel strongly that Snapchat should not be confined to our mobile application, the amazing Snaps created by our community deserve wider distribution so they can be enjoyed by everyone.", "We recently rolled out Stories Everywhere, so that the whole world can easily view Stories on the web. We\u2019ve also started bringing Snaps to bigger screens like stadium jumbotrons at this year\u2019s Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl. Removing friction from the way people use Snapchat and view Snaps will help us continue to grow our community over the coming year. One of the things that makes Snapchat so unique is our Camera and how frequently it is used by our community. This is different from many other services where content is uploaded from other sources rather than created in-app.", "Today, 97% of all the Snaps sent on Snapchat are created using our Camera. With billions of Snaps created every day, we have a unique opportunity to engage our community with augmented reality experiences overlaid on our Camera. Every week, on average, more than half of the entire 13 to 34-year-old population of the United States plays with augmented reality Lenses in Snapchat. We recently expanded our Lenses product with the release of Lens Studio, a set of desktop creative tools that make it easy for anyone to create their own augmented reality experiences and distribute them using Snapchat.", "In just six weeks from launch, over 30,000 Lenses were created by our community and viewed over one billion times. We are blown away by the ingenuity of our community and we can\u2019t wait to see what they create next. We\u2019ll be working hard to expand Lens Studio for years to come. Our content partners continue to shine on Snapchat, and we\u2019re seeing great traction around our new Shows format. In the fourth quarter, more 13 to 34-year-old U.S. viewers watched an average episode of Face Forward by E! on Snapchat than many of the most popular television shows during the same period. Our sports coverage continues to expand, and this season we entertained more than 30 million football fans in the United States with over 400 NFL Stories.", "We\u2019ve built our content business on the belief that sustainable partnerships benefit everyone involved: our partners, our community, and our company. This year we generated over $100 million in revenue for our content partners and we\u2019re excited to deepen these relationships over the coming years. In addition to our ongoing efforts in user growth, augmented reality, and content, we believe that the redesign of our application that we announced on our last call will provide a strong foundation for the evolution of our business.", "That\u2019s because our redesign separates social from media, solving many of the problems that arise when friends are commingled with professional content creators. While we are still very early in the rollout, we are optimistic about the potential to unlock additional growth with the redesign of our application. As expected, it will take time for our community to get used to the changes, but overall, we are pleased with the initial results and will be making the redesign available to our entire community in Q1. There is a lot of work ahead as we optimize the updated application, but our early observations support the thesis behind the new architecture and the many growth opportunities that it provides.", "For example, in one of our first test markets, we saw that the number of Daily Active Users watching Publisher Stories on Discover grew by over 40% when compared to the old design of the application. We also saw gains in ad performance, both in terms of view time and engagement, as well as an overall increase in our Average Revenue Per User when compared to the prior design.", "Additionally, we believe that the redesign has also made our application simpler and easier to use, especially for older users. Compared to the old design, core metrics around content consumption and time spent in the redesigned application are disproportionately higher for users over the age of 35, which bodes well for increasing engagement among older users as we continue to grow our business.", "Our design and engineering teams are constantly monitoring the rollout of the redesign and making improvements based on what we learn from our community and their usage of Snapchat. These adjustments to our products will continue over the next few quarters as we continue to optimize the application.", "Our work during 2017 is proof that we aren\u2019t afraid to make big changes for the long-term success of our business. We redesigned the Snapchat application, transitioned our Snap Ad business to an auction model, and made changes to our team to improve productivity and collaboration. We enter 2018 energized by the opportunities in front of us and excited to deliver against our plan for user growth, augmented reality, and content.", "I\u2019ll now hand over the call to Imran for a discussion of our business results.", "Imran Khan", "Thank you, Evan, and hi everyone. We had a great fourth quarter. Total advertising revenue for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year and 38% quarter-over-quarter. The investments we have made across our advertising business are starting to pay off, and we are pleased with the results we have seen so far. We remained focused on three key areas throughout the year, and I would like to provide an update on each area.", "One, enhancing our ad product suite; two, developing efficient tools for our advertisers; and three, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. First, enhancing our ad product suite. We want to offer ad products that are valuable to all advertisers. This means developing and refining solutions that solve a wide variety of business objectives. Not only does this allow us to serve more advertisers, it also helps us become a one-stop shop for those that continue to invest in our platform.", "Our strategy is paying off. For example, of the Top 100 Ad Age Advertisers that started advertising with us in Q1 of 2016 or earlier, each one of them, at a parent level, also spent with us in 2017 and over 90% of them spent in every quarter of 2017. In Q4, we launched a new ad format called Promoted Story. Our advertising partners have told us that they want a way to spend more time with their audiences. Promoted Story allows brands to take advantage of the familiar stories format that we invented four years ago. It\u2019s been just over a month since launch, and we have seen some amazing Stories from advertisers such as State Farm, Dominos, T-Mobile, and American Express. More importantly, our community is embracing our new format. On average, users that chose to watch Promoted Stories viewed them for over 10 seconds. In the coming weeks, we plan to make this format available in our self-service tools, making it the first Story Ad unit buyable within the Snap Ads auction platform.", "We have also seen strong growth in our direct-response business. In April of last year, we launched the ability to bid for installs in our self-service tools. This allowed advertisers to optimize campaigns for users most likely to install their app. Our ongoing investment in machine learning and our commitment to improving efficiency for advertisers is paying off. We drove 15 times more app installs in December compared to April, while continuing to drive increased return on investment. As we doubled our total revenue from app-install campaigns since the beginning of Q4, we also significantly decreased Cost per Installs for our advertisers.", "One great example of our progress on the direct-response front is Etermax, the creators of the mobile trivia game, Trivia Crack. Using our app-install ads, they were able to acquire high-value, highly engaged users at scale. They saw that Snapchat users were 25% more likely to still play the game after a week, compared to users from other platforms. And overall Snapchat users played the game for twice as long as users acquired anywhere else. Importantly, they were able to achieve these results at a Cost Per Signup and Cost Per Install that was 20% lower than other channels.", "The second area of focus is developing efficient tools for our advertisers. We know that in order to truly scale our business, advertising on Snapchat has to be really easy. As Evan mentioned, in Q4, over 90% of Snap Ad impressions were delivered programmatically. In Q4 of 2016, this number was under 10%, so we\u2019re really happy about how quickly our advertisers have embraced this transition and continue to do so. In fact, the number of advertisers spending in the auction doubled quarter-over-quarter.", "We\u2019re also really excited that these self-service tools have allowed us to reach different types of advertisers, not just big brands. Revenue from small and medium-sized businesses more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. For the first time, revenue in Q4 from advertisers outside of Ad Age\u2019s Top 100 exceeded revenue from the Top 100 Advertisers.", "The Penny Hoarder is a great example of an SMB that is growing their business on Snapchat. The Penny Hoarder is a website dedicated to personal finance tips. They came to Snapchat with the goal of finding a new audience that couldn't be reached on other platforms. In just a few months\u2019 time, their Snap Ads campaigns generated 40% higher returns than other platforms and drove a 51% increase in their revenue. We're thrilled by the results they have seen.", "Our self-service tools have also enabled us to quickly scale in international markets. For example, in the Middle East, we made the strategic decision to rely exclusively on our selfserve tools for Snap Ads. Starting on October 1, Snap Ads could only be purchased through Ad Manager, and this decision quickly paid off. In three months, we more than tripled the number of advertisers spending in our auction, and out of all our international offices, this region was our top contributor to overall revenue growth in Q4.", "Still, we have a lot of opportunity to make it even easier for advertisers. Snap Publisher, a web tool for vertical video creation, was a great milestone on the Snap Ads front, and most recently, we took a big step in helping brands with augmented reality. As Evan mentioned, we launched Lens Studio less than two months ago to make it easier for our community and our advertisers to create Lenses. Foot Locker was our first advertiser to leverage Lens Studio to create a Sponsored Lens. They worked with our Lens Studio partner, North Kingdom, on a Lens that was incredibly successful and highly engaging. On average, users played with their Lens for 45 seconds!", "Lastly, proving the effectiveness of our advertising. In Q4, we made a lot of good progress with Snap Pixel. We focused on scaling its usage as well as building out its capabilities. In just two months since its launch, some of the most visited websites have installed the Pixel across thousands of domains. Many of these advertisers were previously not spending with us until we had stronger first-party measurement solutions. One out of every three advertisers that participated in the Q4 Pixel beta spent their first dollar on Snap after they got access to the Pixel.", "The Pixel is helping us to unlock dollars, especially from performance budgets. We think this will continue as we build out additional capabilities, such as dynamic custom audiences, conversion optimization, and secondary objective optimization. We also rolled out Pixel Custom Audiences in December, which allows advertisers to reach audiences based on actions such as visiting their site. It is very early but we\u2019re seeing good results. We still have a lot of work to do here but we\u2019re excited about what this can do, mostly for our midmarket and SMB customers.", "Our focus on online to offline measurement throughout the year helped us capitalize on the holiday season. We know Q4 is a critical time for many of our advertisers, especially retailers, and they want their campaigns to drive store visits and sales. Target partnered with us, using Snap Ads and Filters, to drive action intent and in-store visitation for holiday shopping. We drove a 16 percentage-point lift in action intent to shop at Target for the holidays as measured by Nielsen, as well as over 660,000 incremental visitors to their stores as measured by Snap to Store, which is our proprietary solution that measures foot traffic in stores.", "We continue to invest in our measurement ecosystem and now have 19 third-party measurement partners. In Q4, we partnered with the National Research Group, a leading data provider in the movie industry, to understand the impact that our ad campaigns have on opening weekend box office. Our ongoing partnership demonstrates that Snapchatters represent 36% of moviegoers and 50% of ticket sales.", "Additionally, movies that advertise on Snapchat are 22% more likely to be moviegoers\u2019 first choice in theaters on the opening weekend, a metric that is highly correlated to opening weekend box office. We\u2019re really happy with the progress we made in 2017. We still have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re excited to keep the momentum going.", "Thank you for the time today, and here\u2019s Drew to discuss our financial results.", "Drew Vollero", "Thanks, Imran, and good afternoon everyone. Simply put, our fourth quarter results represented a major step forward for Snap, both financially and operationally. Overall, we saw improvements across our business, but I will comment on four specific areas of interest for Q4.", "First, revenues increased 72% year-over-year and 37% sequentially, anchored by growing auction traction and holiday brand sales. Revenues for the year more than doubled, up 104%. Second, gross margin expanded substantially, which continues to validate that our business model can scale profitably. As Evan noted, gross margins were 36%, improving over 2,700 basis points year-over-year and up 1,400 basis points in just one quarter.", "Third, headcount growth continues to moderate, thanks to productivity gains from our team. Net additions in the quarter were slightly more than 100, one-third of the rate of recent quarters. And fourth, cash burn declined 49% sequentially, driven by more focused capital deployment priorities and thoughtful cash management.", "I will now expand on each. First, global revenues grew to $286 million in the fourth quarter. We saw growth in every region, and international markets now represent 23% of our total revenue, up from 12% a year ago and 20% last quarter.", "As expected, the fastest growing product in Q4 was Snap Ads, and specifically, Snap Ads sold through the auction. Many of the auction dynamics were consistent with prior quarters, although ad volumes were much higher in Q4. It was very encouraging to see some substantial daily sales volumes flowing through the auction during the quarter.", "As expected, revenue gains were driven by growth in ad impressions, partially offset by Snap Ad pricing, which fell sequentially due to the mix shift from managed to programmatic and reserved to bidded ads.", "Let me share some numbers with you on impressions and pricing. First, Snap Ad impressions, excluding Promoted Stories, were up 90% sequentially and up over 575% year-over-year. Second, overall Snap Ad pricing, excluding Promoted Stories, was down more than 15% sequentially, and nearly 70% year-over-year.", "Third, we ended the quarter with over 90% of our ads served programmatically, up from 80% in the prior quarter. Over the medium term, we believe that increasing our advertiser count will have a positive impact on our pricing. In the quarter, we saw the percentage of contested auctions increase versus the prior quarter, and auctions that were contested continued to have higher prices than single-bidded auctions.", "Now, looking at our key cost drivers, we are excited to continue to see our economic model gaining traction: growing revenues coupled with banded user expenses fueled gross margin expansion again in Q4.", "Please note that when I discuss all of our expense figures including gross margins, they will exclude stock based compensation and related payroll taxes as well as depreciation and amortization and non-recurring charges.", "The cost leverage we are seeing is particularly apparent on a per user basis. In Q4, our ARPU increased 46% year-over-year to $1.53, while our costs per user, or CoRPU, only increased 2%, to $0.98. We\u2019ve been able to moderate user cost growth through the successful execution of our multi cloud strategy. Specifically, hosting costs per user dropped from $0.72 a year ago to $0.70 in the quarter. That's great progress in a year when our sales have more than doubled and engagement metrics have grown substantially.", "As a result, worldwide gross margins expanded to 36%. Internal analyses continue to suggest our economic model can scale well as North American gross margins are well above the worldwide average, driven by their higher ARPU, which was $2.75 in the quarter.", "Now moving down the income statement, the primary driver for operating expenses remains people cost. In the quarter, our hiring pace slowed substantially. Specifically, net adds were slightly more than 100, as we started to lever our significant early investments in people.", "Hiring mix remains a priority, and the absolute number of back-office employees declined in Q4. Overall operating expenses were up 17% sequentially, driven by modest hiring, increased sales commissions, legal costs, and year-end expenses.", "Lastly, we focused on capital deployment priorities and thoughtfully managed our cash position this quarter. CapEx remained modest at $21 million and less than $85 million for the year, driven by our capital light infrastructure strategy. Our CapEx per user for the year was less than $0.50, which we believe leads the industry.", "M&A was modest in the quarter, and we adopted a sell-to-cover approach for vested restricted stock units for employees during the quarter, which substantially reduced our cash spend. As a result, we were able to reduce our cash burn by 49% sequentially. We ended 2017 with $2 billion in cash and marketable securities.", "As of December 31, 2017, total shares outstanding were 1,222 million and 1,420 million on a fully diluted basis. Q4 represented a significant step forward for Snap on the key financial metrics. As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to manage our business for the long term. In 2018, there is much to do and we are focused to deliver on our key priorities.", "I want to share some financial thoughts with you for the early part of the year. First, as we think about revenue growth in Q1 2018, we start with the current momentum in the business. Specifically, we saw strong growth in Q4, and our year-over-year advertising revenue growth rate accelerated to 74%. In Q1, we are planning for our year-over-year revenue growth rate to moderate from the Q4 pace. The majority of our revenue is generated through brand advertising, which seasonally peaks in the fourth quarter.", "Additionally, we are planning for the transition of the creative tools business to the programmatic platform, which we believe will drive additional impressions at lower prices and result in more modest growth in the first half of 2018. Also note that in Q1 2017, we had $8 million of Spectacles revenue which we are planning to be substantially down year-over-year and sequentially.", "On hosting expenses, we exited the fourth quarter with a slightly higher cost per DAU than the quarterly average of $0.70. The cost impact of our application redesign has yet to be fully determined. That said, we are focused on executing additional cost saving initiatives in 2018 to continue to offset future cost increases.", "With respect to operating expenses, we are planning for continued gains in team productivity and modest hiring. We are planning for operating-expense growth to moderate in the first half of 2018 and be up low double digits versus the second half of 2017, primarily driven by more focused hiring in front-of-house functions.", "Please note that this does not include any potential acquisitions. Capital expenditures were less than $85 million in 2017, and we are planning for a slight increase in 2018. We are moving many of our headquarter teams to a series of leased facilities in Santa Monica during the first half of the year, although we do expect additional moves to occur later in the year and into 2019 as well.", "With that, I will now turn the line back to the operator to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "That concludes the prepared remarks for today\u2019s earnings call. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, after your initial question is asked your line will be muted. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.", "And our first question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Ross Sandler", "Great, thanks. Just two questions. One for Evan and one for Imran. Evan you mentioned that Android retention is up 20% quarter-on-quarter. Can you just give us some color on what\u2019s driving that? And then you also said that engagement in the older cohorts and with \u2013 and with discover is up pretty big following the redesign. So how does the engagement Snaps compare with younger cohorts versus the older cohorts?", "And then second question for Imran, we saw some news in the upfront that you guys have secured as much as $70 million in ad revenue for the winter Olympics. So can you just talk about how much of that of flow through Snap and how that kind of triangulates with the comments about the first quarter? Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "Thanks, Ross. Yeah, I think in my comments earlier I talked about a year-over-year increase in retention. We have been working very hard to provide more value to our users when they sign-up and one of the key ways that we do this is try to make sure that they have a lot of great friends ready for them. So we rolled out quick out over this year, and that\u2019s made a huge difference on making sure that folks who sign up, get the friends they need quickly. I can\u2019t provide any detail on cohorts but we\u2019re excited with the progress we have been making on Android.", "Imran Khan", "So on the Olympic side, Ross, let me jump on that one. So we are very excited to have a special event like the winter Olympics. And we believe Snap, the community will really enjoy what we have there. We\u2019re excited to be the biggest mobile partner there. Obviously, it\u2019s an extension of a success or strong overall partnership we have with NBCUniversal and it builds on the success that we had with the summer Olympics back in 2016.", "So as our business is growing, we look to these tentpole events as engagement drivers and when we do financial drivers. And so our core business today is much bigger than it was back in the summer of 2016. Now we have been working with advertisers and our ad packages have sold well, so we do expect modest revenue tailwind in Q1. But overall percentage revenue boost to our sales base we expect to be less than what it was a couple of years ago when we had a smaller business.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.", "Stephen Ju", "Okay, thanks. Imran, I recall you were saying, I think it was two quarters ago that you\u2019re looking to evangelize the platform and lowering advertisers or cheaper price inventory. You have touched on this to some degree on the prepared remarks, but \u2013 around the Pixel, but how are the conversations going now? Do you still feel like you have to sell the benefits of advertising of Snap especially for the DR guys? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes, I think, the conversation is going really well as evident by our Q4 result. And I think a couple of things happening. Number one, we are really offering very attractive value to our advertisers on our platform given our size and scale and you are seeing that more and more advertisers are coming to our platform and number of advertisers and auction doubled in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. The second thing is on a direct response side, we are seeing great success on app install and lead generation and we are aggressively moving into e-commerce customers with the launch of Pixel and early trend looks really good and we are really excited about that.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Justin Post", "Great, nice revenue quarter. A couple of questions for you. Maybe Imran, the ad impressions were up 575%. Is that all just demand generated or did the company make a decision to open up more ad impressions this year? And how much \u2013 do you just feel like you have tremendous rooms still to grow there? And then maybe a question for Drew, you have on that a little bit. But was there any just unusual item in the fourth quarter as far as revenues that we should be thinking about that that might not sustained into next year? Thank you.", "Imran Khan", "Yeah, with 170 million \u2013 187 million daily active users who are incredibly engaged. We have a lot of inventory on our platform and we think there are still a lot of room for us to grow.", "Drew Vollero", "So, and Justin \u2013 hey, it\u2019s Drew. On the revenue side of the world, we did try to call out a couple of those in my comments. We are a brand business and we do believe that the brand business seasonally peaks in the fourth quarter. So that was something we wanted to highlight as you think about the early part of the year. Also as you think about the early part of the year, our spectacles business was $8 million last year in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect that business to annualize or even sequentially comp to where it has been.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mark Mahaney", "I want to try to get at the question of the sustainability of two trends, the DAU trends and the revenue growth trends. And I guess I would like to ask it in \u2013 in the first in the DAU trends in terms of the how far you think you are along in terms of kind of \u201cfixing the Android of problems\u201d or the crash where are the crash levels were versus where you have had them before? I know in the past you talked about having that all finalized by Q2 of this you. Do you think you are already there? So is there any more you need to do with Android in order to get that experience like you wanted?", "And then on the revenue side, I guess the one thing I\u2019d add there is it sounds like you\u2019re already through all of the auctions \u2013 the transition to the auction process. So I would think that this kind of growth rates that we\u2019re seeing leaving aside seasonality is relatively sustainable. But anything else you would want to do to caution us on extrapolating the growth from here other than the seasonality and the spectacles?", "Evan Spiegel", "So on the DAU side; obviously we talked a lot in 2017 about Android and how much we have focused on it. And today we have some of the lowest ever crash rates that we have seen, but we\u2019re still going to be doing a lot of work to rebuild the Android application. There are components of that in the updated discover functionality and it\u2019s rolling out in the redesign and so that\u2019s great to see. The frame dropping has gone away. The scroll performance is awesome and streaming is making huge difference for people who are watching content of our service. So I think that\u2019s a great step in the right direction, especially with the resign, but you will see a lot more this year and we have been chopping a lot of word on that for a long-time as you know.", "Drew Vollero", "It\u2019s Drew here. Hey a couple of thoughts for you on the overall business, Mark. So in terms of the revenue growth drivers, we didn\u2019t talk about the seasonality, we talked about the spectacles, spectacle as a smaller piece. Overall, the way that you should think about the business is really that the engine that drove the growth in the fourth quarter will continue to drive our growth really is the option platform that\u2019s really where things are heading. There is a smaller piece of our business on the creative tools side. We will be transitioning that in the first half of the year as we transition that we do expect to see gains and impression offset by declines in prices, but really sort of as you are thinking about big picture ideas and where our business is going, what\u2019s the business drivers are, it really is going to be Snap Ads and the auction for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Heath Terry", "Great, thanks. Evan, how do you experienced with the redesign impact in a way that you\u2019re planning product development? Where and how has it impacted your priorities? And then Drew just a quick one. Given the progress on cash burn, how should we be thinking about your trajectory there going forward?", "Evan Spiegel", "We decoupled the redesign from a lot of the feature development that we have been working on, so that\u2019s continued and I am very excited about the product pipeline for this year. The redesign is really focused on three things. We want to make the app easier to use. We want to bring your friends together and we want to elevate a lot of the great content that we have and discover. And so far I think we have accomplished all three and we have tried to be very deliberate. In the rollout, we have learned a lot as we have rolled it out. It's out now about 40 million folks and we\u2019re excited on the progress there. So we will be working on a lot of that throughout the year and for the years to come, but that\u2019s decoupled from the feature development process internally.", "Drew Vollero", "And Heath on the working capital or just general of the cash burn of the business, obviously big picture cash is very important to us, liquidity is something that we look at all the time. If you think about sort of the uses of cash for the business, we\u2019re EBITDA negative and investments in business operations continue to be our number one capital deployment priority. Our second capital deployment priorities, M&A, it\u2019s opportunistic as you know. So sometimes we do stuffs, sometimes we don\u2019t. I do think we can do a better job of thinking about cash versus stock mix as we do that. But I think we\u2019re still in the M&A game and we will be periodically looking at deals. I do think the big change we made between the third and fourth quarter was really we stopped buying back employee shares here in the fourth quarter and that was a big piece of what the change in cash burn was.", "I also think we did a better job of managing our working capital within the balance sheet and that\u2019s just the maturing business getting better than what it does. So, overall, it\u2019s really going to be the investment in the business and the M&A our capital deployments and those are the primary uses of cash.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Lloyd Walmsley", "Hey, guys. Congrats on the solid results. This is actually Matt chiming in on Lloyd\u2019s behalf. The question, two questions, really, one with the Android developments, could you talk about where you saw the engagement increase? Was it pretty uniform across your geographies or are there any differences to call out there? And two for any advertisers, who might have been with you that have been since left?", "What were the key challenges that they faced? And have those challenges been addressed whether that\u2019s targeting ROIs like a measurability, maybe not finding the right demographic, any color there would be helpful.", "Evan Spiegel", "So with the advertiser strike I think we've made tremendous progress in delivering things that advertisers are looking for. We made tremendous progress on app install side, tremendous problem \u2013 progress on lead generation side and we also launched Pixel. And I think a lot of the advertisers, primary who were on the e-commerce segment are looking for Pixel to really understand how we are driving growth. And I think that's the one big area that we continue to invest.", "The other area is that we have continued to remain really focused to buying add on Snapchat absolutely easy. And we did make a lot of progress with Snap publishers and we are going to continue to do so and that will also continue to drive growth. But overall, we are very happy with the progress we made and going to continue to do so. And in terms of Android geography, we saw improvement across the geographies. So there\u2019s no one specific geographic to point that out.", "Operator", "The next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Eric Sheridan", "Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on the advertising. The way you guys break up the business in talking about it between managed, versus programmatic, to reserved, versus bided, is there any chance you can give us color about the skew in terms of percentage of revenue that tilts one way or the other? And also the differences in price between the two so we could get a better sense of where we are in the transition on the revenue base and on the pricing mix in the business? Thanks so much.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes with regards to breaking down revenue by channel, we don't do that. But I think one thing I believe Drew pointed out that programmatic was the fastest growing segment of the business as evident by the number of impression that is flowing through the programmatic business.", "With regards to pricing, I think, we really focus here to drive return on investment for advertisers. If we drive more return on investment for advertisers that means more advertisers will come to our platform. We're just getting started, there are 26 million small businesses out there, we want to capture a big chunk of that. So we are less focused on price, more focused on driving value and driving growth.", "But in general right even an advertiser wants to reserve a date that always have high price than bided pricing. So that's how usually it works.", "Operator", "And our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "John Blackledge", "Great, thank you. So the user growth was better than expected. I'm just wondering if you have any color on engagement, time spent on the platform, and how you think about kind of the key engagement drivers in 2018? And then just a quick one on the total number of advertisers on the platform. Thank you.", "Evan Spiegel", "I don't have any material updates for you on engagement, but I did see I yesterday Verizon releasing numbers about their customers\u2019 usage during the Super Bowl. And I guess last year we were number three in terms of overall usage during the Super Bowl and this year we were number one. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that directionally, but no specific updates for you today.", "Imran Khan", "In terms of the total number of advertisers on the platform, obviously it's a key accelerator for our business. We know when we get more competition on the auction we take it. So we\u2019re aware that we can drive pricing over the medium turn. We did double the number of advertisers on the platform, we're still a young business with a lot of room to grow, but we're excited by the progress in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Anmuth", "Thanks for taking the question. I have two first for Drew or Imran, can you just help us understand how your longstanding kind of existing advertisers are behaving in a reserved media world versus auction just how their behavior is shifting And then secondly, Evan you talked a couple times about removing friction, what are the opportunities that you're thinking about in 2018 to continue doing that? Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Hi, thanks Doug. I think if you look at the large advertisers, they have different buckets of budgets, right. So they have always on budget, they have activation budget surrounding some events like Super Bowl, they have new initiative budgets. And what we're trying to do is play into all of those buckets and trying to capture dollar. So with regards to always on budget that's the money we are getting on to our auction platform, to our self-service platform. But then we also have this incredible ad unit tools like lenses and filters that\u2019s really unique and no other platform has that at scale like us. And you can see that large advertisers take advantage of those products or take advantage of our premium products like for shows and discover to surrounding some events or deliver some message. They want to do that to as part of their premium content strategy. Like Super Bowl, I think, I don't know if you saw that, we had a couple of great lenses and that did really, really well. And we are really, really excited about that.", "Drew Vollero", "On the removing friction mandate over here, I think, one of the key things is all of the new processes we have around quality and performance that will continue to make a big difference for us and were obviously a big focus of last year. But also we have some major architectural changes coming to both IOS and android, coming throughout the year and we're excited about the opportunities there.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Mark May with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Mark May", "Thanks. I have two. I think the first for Drew and then the next one Evan. Getting back to the question a lot of people have asked around the outlook for Q1 revenue we can obviously kind of back out spectacle impact. And brand I guess is seasonal like you said, so it should be \u2013 the seasonality should have reflected in the year ago. So I guess I'm just trying to understand coming off of a strong Q4 with accelerating trends the auction dynamics, et cetera that are benefiting you. Why would you \u2013 what is sort of driver of the \u201cmoderating growth\u201d in Q1? It seems like you've got some nice tailwinds on a year-on-year basis, ex Spectacles, going into Q1.", "And then for Evan there have been some other players, some other social apps in the space that have kind of admitted that some of the ways that their users are using their apps may not always be deemed good uses of time, right more around focusing going for more on quality versus quantity. I wonder if that's something that you think is in any parts of SnapChat an issue and anything that you're sort of addressing from that perspective? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "So let me comment on the first question. So we did comment on the underlying drivers for the spike up that we did see in the fourth quarter. And we did share we\u2019re thinking internally about the Q1 dynamics. The largest piece of our revenue for our business in Q4 remains brand sales. And we believe brand revenue seasonally peaks in Q4. And so as the business now has more scale, we believe year-over-year growth rates are probably the most relevant way to think about our business. We think it neutralizes the brand seasonality and it's frankly our team thinks about managing its business.", "So we're thinking about that a year-over-year growth rate and that's why I try to target that 74%, so you get a sense on that. But what we did try to do was point out some of that underlying drivers, the seasonality, the change in some of the creative that we moved to self-serve and then a little bit which is a smaller piece of the business on the spectacle side. So we try to give you some thoughts. Those are the big movers if you think about our business in the first quarter.", "And on the product side from the beginning we've been really thoughtful about how we approach these issues, it's one of the reasons why we've never had public facing metrics around followers or likes and why we've always tried to control the distributes content very widely on our platform.", "And I think if you look at the redesign the evolution with the redesign, what we're trying to say is that there's a really big difference between talking to your friends on the telephone and broadcasting on a TV channel. And I think our society has noticed that difference for a really long time and that's why there's different regulations and rules around communicating with your friends and broadcasting media. And so for us, as we evolve the product, I think this allows us to really reinforce the great things about our communications product, bring friends closer together and at the same time provide more distribution to really high quality content.", "So I think we're trying to stay way ahead of the curve on this stuff and it\u2019s the thing we care a lot about.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Jason Helfstein", "Thanks, two questions. So you did share a good amount of learnings on the app redesign. Are you getting input from advertisers and agencies? So kind of how deep is the learnings going? And then it does seem like brand will be a lower percent of the mix going forward between brand, DR and then large versus small advertisers. So if any thoughts about how to think about the mix of advertisers going forward and kind of the benefits of greater diversification, thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "Yes, we are taking a feedback from advertisers and advertisers and agencies, a perfect example of Promoted Stories. Agencies and advertisers always told us that they wanted a new way to tell their stories, and that's why we launched Promoted Stories and we're thrilled with the success we are seeing and really, really excited about the opportunity.", "The second question was around mix shift between brand and DR. I think for the first time in Company\u2019s history more than 50% of our revenue came from advertisers who were outside the Ad Age Top 100. As we said there are 26 million or so large and small businesses out there and there's a tremendous opportunity to help those advertisers to be successful and they are looking for ways to reach new users and we can help them. And so we really dedicated to focus \u2013 as we do that, you will see that the mix will change and that will also muted seasonality in the business hopefully in the long term.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Youssef Squali", "All right. Two questions, please. Starting with Drew, on the cost side, can you shed some more light into the strength in the gross margin, components of that and more importantly, as we look into 2018, it looks like 2017 had a lot of noise to it from a gross margin side. How should we be thinking about the seasonality on that line? And then Evan, GDPR requires changes to the consent recommendation is around kids 16 and under, I know, international is a relatively small percentage of the overall business. But how do you envision this effect in Snap\u2019s on boarding process and just any other potential fallout from GDPR or not? Thanks.", "Drew Vollero", "So let me speak to some of the wins that are happening on gross margin, you\u2019re right. Gross margins have been expanding here and been expanding for a while, we did have a terrific quarter, gross margins went from 21% sequentially up to 36% and a similar expansion on a year-over-year basis. Really it\u2019s \u2013 we have a powerful model when we can get incremental sales here. And so if you think about the marginal cost to serve here, it\u2019s not high. And so simply put, sales have been growing a lot faster than within our costs on a variable side, which has been terrific.", "Our cost structure really on the variable side as infrastructure costs and rev share both of which were been heading in the right direction. Our infrastructure costs are down $0.72 last year to $0.70, we\u2019re just doing an excellent job of executing on a multi-cloud strategy, we\u2019re winning there. And obviously, we\u2019re taking the capital out of the business as we deal with so that\u2019s really two wins that we\u2019ve been executing on the infrastructure side.", "On the rev share side, as we continue to open up more owned inventory that those incremental sales dollars come without a rev share. So that\u2019s really been helping manage down the revenue share percentages, it was 14% of sales last year, now it\u2019s 10% and we\u2019ve seen good leverage on that all along. So really it\u2019s a powerful combination of growing revenues and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of flattening the costs in marginal cost. And so you\u2019ve seen the expansion of the gross margin over the last six quarters, it\u2019s been nice progress.", "Evan Spiegel", "On the GDPR front something that we are ready for and we\u2019ve been very thoughtful about how we approach privacy in our product. Obviously, things like the right to be forgotten are close to our heart. It's something that we have a very serious focus on.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one for Evan. Evan, you were talking about kind of the trying to stay a step ahead of everyone else, when you think about the product. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of questions from investors about the kind of the rational for the redesign and how much of it was something you saw that you didn\u2019t like and use your behavior or was it trying to meet advertiser demand? And it seems like you\u2019re trying to portray as, this was more of nothing was wrong, we just believe we can be better. I just want to \u2013 could you maybe just set the record straight to confirm that the rational driving the redesign.", "And then just a question for Imran and Drew. You obviously exceeded Wall Street expectations for Q4, but as you think forward for a full year 2018, I think, if you look back to the IPO expectations were for roughly $2 billion of revenue in 2018. That\u2019s now down to call it a $3 billion at least before today\u2019s call and while I know you don\u2019t give guidance. Wondering how you feel about the level of consensus out there in terms of ability for the company to meet or exceed the way you did in Q4?", "Evan Spiegel", "Hey, Rich. We\u2019re always trying to improve the product and we\u2019re pretty relentless about it. We see here huge amount of opportunity both in the redesign, but also all the other stuff. That we are working on and obviously, it\u2019s what we want to do. So we\u2019re really excited about our work there.", "Drew Vollero", "In terms of the overall thoughts for the year, Rich, and look the Snap Ad sold through the auction that are going to continue to be our main revenue driver in 2018. The auction continues to be new for us, where there\u2019s lots of optimizing going behind the scenes, every single day on pricing, on targeting et cetera. But there are a series of new technologies, enablers, accelerators like the Pixel by targeting improvements, new products. But they should be accelerated for our business, but it\u2019s difficult to predict when they\u2019re going to be ready. And so as a result, our revenue visibility is really more in the near-term. And so that\u2019s why we shared some thoughts with you as it relates to the first quarter on the underlying drivers of the business. And so that\u2019s the visibility that we have comfort with at this point. So that\u2019s why we share those thoughts.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Thanks. I think you guys got assist before maybe a couple quarters ago. I would think I\u2019ll add with the strength that you\u2019re seeing in self-serve and we thought about opening up the auction to third-party DSPs to increase the number of advertisers to get it\u2019s more pricing point be there platform. Thanks.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think when you open it up to third-party DSP providers that are always a risk that some of the user ideas will leak our platform, and I think we have really, really focused on user privacy. And ultimately that\u2019s a very, very important part of it. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re interested in doing that. I think what\u2019s really makes great that \u2013 effort anybody can logon to our platform and buy advertisement. And there are a lot of advertisers, who are looking to acquire new customers and we do our strength in the millennials market, right, 70% of 13 to 34 in U.S., UK, France on those markets are on our platform. And so we\u2019re really excited that what we can offer and I think that\u2019s a great way to grow our business without compromising potential privacy issues.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Egbert with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "John Egbert", "Thanks. I had a couple questions on maps. I was wondering how maps fit into the redesign. Are you seeing increased used of maps and/or stories you didn\u2019t maps for the test users. That you\u2019re tracking. Is it a priority to make maps usage more friction less and redesign. And then on monetization on \u2013 it seems likes stories of reviewed from maps on the interface are still on monetize. There at least a very under monetized. Should we expect to see that change anytime soon or what type of criteria are you evaluating there? Thanks.", "Evan Spiegel", "We\u2019re really excited about maps and we have over 100 million monthly active users from Maps. And we'll be working on improving the frequency with which people use that product, mostly by trying to provide more value around using the maps experience. Today, it\u2019s hard to know where to go, it\u2019s hard to navigate interesting things that are happening. And so as we improve the product, we will make it easier for you to find the most interesting things that happened on your map. So I think a lot of work to do there, of course, and we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re bubbling it up higher, obviously in the redesign. On monetization, we\u2019re not currently monetizing maps and nothing to share on that front.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ron Josey", "Great, thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask about international expansion, I think Imran and Evan you mentioned about working with carrier partners internationally, and then also selling ads through Snap Ads through Ad manager in newer markets like the Middle East. So just wanted understand, if there\u2019s maybe a little bit of change in strategy, in terms of focusing on the top ad markets globally or just looking at launching everywhere? And then in terms of moderating headcount, just really quick, if you could provide any sort of insight on reducing the friction or improving I think productivity gains \u2013 you mentioned back office employees declined, but is there any change in sales structure given the strength in the auction. Thank you.", "Imran Khan", "Yes. I think with as our business becoming more and more programmatic ourselves forces becoming a consultant to our clients. And I think that is very important, because I think, we have a still lot of work to do to educate the market. And really teach the market, how to create vertical video, audio that really works on mobile environment. Many of our advertising partners are really waiting by creating great ad content and really understanding how to take advantage of our platform. And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest on that and I think that\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for us to capture market share by doing so.", "With regards to international market, look I think international is a great opportunity more and more advertisers in the international market wants to use Snapchat to reach their audience and we continue to be aggressive drilling out of the market that we think we can generate profitable revenue growth.", "Evan Spiegel", "As I going to say Ron as we\u2019ve been building up to the 3,000 here, the north star really has been add to the front of house and leverage the back of the house as much as we can. To your point, we saw that in the back of the house for the fourth quarter, but we have been able to move the mix front of house with engineering in sales, it\u2019s now over 80% of the people at the company that\u2019s by design. And so really those remain our strategic priorities. We are going to be focusing hiring to your point as we move forward. But those remain high priorities for us.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s session. You may now disconnect."]}
