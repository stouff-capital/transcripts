Riley FBR", "Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the WD-40 Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today's call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge; and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.", "In addition to the financial information presented on today's call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release, and Form 10-Q for the period ending May 31, 2018. These documents are available on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.wd40company.com.

The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our SEC filings as well as our earnings presentation.", "As a reminder, today's call includes forward-looking statements about our expectations for the company's future performance.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Wendy. Good day everyone and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of 107 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 98.2 million in the third period last year. This reflects an increase of 9% year-over-year.", "Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted our sales in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, we grew net sales by 5% year-over-year. Net income for the third quarter was 16.1 million compared to 14.4 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 12% period-over-period, and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.15 compared to $1.02 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Now let\u2019s start our discussions about our strategic initiatives. As most of you will recall, our long-term revenue target is to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025 and to do so while following our 55/30/25 business model.", "We\u2019d like to remind investors that those long-term targets are guideposts, not guidance. We acknowledge that our anticipated 2025 targets are aspirational, but we continue to believe if we keep our focus in the right places we can be successful in moving towards these targets.", "Our strategic driver number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic driver is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people who will find more uses more frequently.", "In order to achieve our target of 530 million of Multi-Purpose Product revenue, we need to continue our steady building of the Multi-Purpose Product across all markets through both geographic expansion as well as through innovation.", "In the third quarter, global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were 82.5 million reflecting an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were up 8% compared to last year.", "In our developed markets, we continue to drive revenue growth through innovation of our flagship product which includes premiumization. As part of our premiumization strategy, we continue to successfully convert WD-40 Multi-Use Product end users to our more innovative Smart Straw and EZ-REACH delivery systems.", "In developing and emerging markets, we continued to build brand awareness among end users through product sampling, specifically targeted end user groups in countries identified as key growth opportunities. As we\u2019ve shared with investors before, we\u2019re investing an additional 1 million in brand building this fiscal year to support initiatives like these.", "Our strategic driver number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our target under this initiative is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line through continued geographic expansion as well as by developing new products and product categories. Our focus is on building market awareness and distribution of WD-40 Specialist in order to achieve our stated goal of 100 million in revenue by the end of 2025.", "In the third quarter, global sales of WD-40 Specialist were 8.5 million, up 16% compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of Specialist were 23.4 million, up 26% compared to last year.", "We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist. However, there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs as we build out distribution and various other factors that come with building out a new product line.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company, to derive revenue from existing brands as well as from new sources and products.", "Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products of 3-IN-ONE, WD-40 Bike and GT85, but also includes homecare and cleaning product brands like Spot Shot, Lava in the Americas; 1001 in EMEA; and No Vac and Solvol in Asia Pacific. We believe we will continue to nurture and grow the products included under this initiative and expect their combined revenue to reach approximately 70 million by the end of fiscal year 2025.", "In the third quarter, global sales of products included under this initiative were 12.1 million reflecting an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of products included under this initiative were up 6% compared to last year.", "WD-40 BIKE had a particularly strong third quarter with solid sales growth across all three trading blocks. Much of the success we\u2019ve seen with BIKE has been achieved through our growing digital presence. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we\u2019re investing an additional $1 million in brand building this fiscal year and a sizable portion of that investment is being used to support and enhance our global digital presence where products like WD-40 BIKE and other Specialist products thrive.", "Strategic driver number four is to attract, develop, and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop, and retain talented tribe members to grow our tribe member engagement to greater than 95%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 467 tribe members around the globe. To support our tribe\u2019s culture, we launched our Leadership Lab program back in 2011 to develop our tribe, sharpen skills, and ultimately build our company\u2019s bench strength.", "Today, our Leadership Lab is present in all three trading blocks and over 920 attendees have engaged in more than 21,000 hours of learning under this program. We recently announced our next generation approach to Leadership Lab, a learning laboratory that is a global program for people development. These learning tools delivered by our tribe for our tribe are excellent examples of our continued commitment to our thriving global workforce.", "Additionally, I\u2019m happy to share with you that we continue to make progress on our plans for renovating a new building to house our UK-based tribe members and we expect to move the tribe to this new building in the second half of fiscal 2019.", "Finally, our fifth strategic initiative is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, making it better than it is today. We measure ourselves against the operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to processes and systems while safeguarding our brands.", "Volatile commodity prices, particularly those for crude oil, have negatively impacted our gross margins recently but over the long term, our 55/30/25 business model guides our business decisions. Accordingly, we have recently made some proactive price increases to ensure our gross margin will remain within our target ranges over the long term.", "Although some of these price rises were in effect prior to the end of the third quarter, in the Americas the price increases just went into effect in June. As a result, we expect we will begin to see the effect of these price increases reflected in our gross margin in the fourth quarter.", "That completes our update on the strategic initiatives. So let\u2019s move on to in a little more details around our third quarter results starting with sales. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated net sales were 107 million in the third quarter, up 9% versus the third quarter last year.", "Translation of our foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, total net sales would have been 102.6 million, an increase of 5% compared to last year. This is what we refer to as translation-related impacts and it affects reported results from Canada, Australia, China, and the EMEA segment.", "In addition, we experienced about 330,000 unfavorable transaction-related impacts in EMEA which slightly offset the impacts of translation. So in total, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our net sales by about 4.1 million in the third quarter.", "Now we\u2019ll take a closer look at the individual segments and we\u2019ll start with the Americas. Net sales in the Americas, which include the United States, Latin America and Canada, increased to 53 million in the third quarter, up about 8% from last year. Year-to-date, sales in the Americas were up 5% compared to last year.", "Sales of maintenance products increased 12% or 5 million in the Americas, largely due to higher sales of maintenance products in the U.S., Latin America and Canada. Maintenance products sales in the United States increased 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to the timing of customers\u2019 orders as well as a 12% increase in the sales of WD-40 EZ-REACH.", "In addition, maintenance products sales were up 34% in Latin America and 39% in Canada mostly due to the timing of customers\u2019 orders and the successful promotional programs that continue in both regions. We estimate that sales of maintenance products in the Americas were up approximately 2 million in the current quarter due to certain customers buying extra product in advance of the price increase which went into effect in June.", "As a reminder, our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 18% in the third quarter compared to the prior year largely due to lower sales of 2000 Flushes, Spot Shot and Carpet Fresh.", "Now we\u2019ll move over to EMEA. Net sales in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, increased to 39.6 million in the third quarter, up 15% from last year. Year-to-date, net sales in EMEA are up 13% compared to last year. EMEA reported results in the third quarter were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA increased by 4% compared to last year.", "As you know, we sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors. Net sales in EMEA direct markets, which accounted for 66% of the region\u2019s sales, increased 19% during the quarter to US$26.1 million. This increase was a result of increased sales of maintenance products in the region and due to foreign currency exchange rates, new distribution and higher levels of promotional activity.", "Net sales in EMEA distributor markets, which accounted for 34% of the region\u2019s sales, increased 9% during the quarter to US$13.5 million. This increase is primarily due to the timing of customer orders of WD-40 Multi-Use Products in Northern Europe. Partially offset, these increases was a 7% decline in sales in Russia due to the continued instability in the region.", "Russian sales during the quarter were also impacted due to restrictions that were placed on shipments of certain products into Russia during the World Cup. These continued challenges in Russia are preventing the distributor market from realizing even higher levels of growth year-over-year.", "Now we\u2019ll go down to Asia-Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China, and other countries in the region, decreased to 14.4 million in the third quarter, down 2% from last year. Year-to-date, net sales in Asia-Pacific were up 3% compared to last year.", "Asia-Pacific\u2019s reported results in the third quarter were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia-Pacific decreased by 5% compared to last year.", "In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were 4.7 million in the third quarter, up 5% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for Australia in the period. This increase in sales was driven primarily by successful promotional activities and the expanded distribution of WD-40 Specialist product line in Australia.", "In our Asia distributor markets, net sales were 5.5 million in the quarter, down 17% compared to last year. Our marketing distributor business in Asia-Pacific has been negatively impacted due to the transitioning of three major marketing distributor partners in the region. This transition has caused the disruption in the region but we believe that we are through the worst part of that transition and that the region will return to growth in the fourth quarter. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell our products in U.S. dollars in the region.", "In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were 4.2 million in the third quarter, up 17% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on these sales. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased 8% period-to-period. The increase in sales was primarily due to successful promotional programs that are ongoing and conducted during the third quarter of this year.", "We remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities in China, although we do expect volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "Now that's it for me. I'm going to pass over to Jay who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thanks, Garry. First, let's review the 55/30/25 business model. These are the long-term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be at 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our goal is to drive our cost of doing business over time toward 30% of net sales. And finally, the 25 which represents EBITDA.", "Let\u2019s look at the 55 or our gross margin. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 55.8% compared to 55.3% last year. This represents a decline of 50 basis points and for the first time in a few years that our gross margin has dipped below our long-term target of 55%. Changes in major input costs, which include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, was the primary driver of this decline and negatively impacted our margin by 140 basis points.", "As you know, crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals and recently we\u2019ve experienced rising oil costs which have put pressure on our cost of goods in all three of our trading blocks. Rising petroleum-based specialty chemical costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 100 basis points in the quarter.", "Also contributing negatively to our gross margin by 40 basis points was the increased cost of aerosol cans. In addition, gross margin was also negatively impacted by 40% due to higher warehousing and inbound freight costs, mostly in the Americas segment and primarily due to the freight market in the U.S.", "Promotion and other discounts that we give our customers also negatively impacted gross margin by 30 basis points. Then finally we had changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by 20 points due to fluctuations in exchange rates for the euro and U.S. dollar against the pound sterling in our EMEA segment. This is because in EMEA, our cost of goods are sourced primarily in pound sterling or approximately 70% of our revenues are generated in currencies other than the pound sterling.", "These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by the combined effects of favorable sales mix changes and decreases in other miscellaneous costs primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments which positively impacted gross margin by 130 basis points. In addition, sales price increases which we implemented in EMEA and Asia-Pacific over the last 12 months positively impacted gross margin by 50 basis points.", "Continually rising input costs have made it necessary for us to review our pricing structure and implement price increases in each of our trade blocks. The price increases in the Americas will take effect in the fourth quarter of this year and will begin to be reflected on our gross margin in coming quarters.", "In the near term, we expect with these price increases in place we can manage gross margin at a level that is near our target of 55%. Unfortunately, due to the recent volatility in the price of crude oil, it is uncertain the level to which our gross margin will be impacted over the short term. However, we will continue to be focused and deliberate in managing our business so that we can maintain our gross margin at a level that is above our target of 55% over the long term.", "Now I\u2019ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the third quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 32% compared to 33% last year. Revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving our long-term target of 30%. In the third quarter of this year, our reported revenue increase positively affected our cost of doing business percentage.", "And for the third quarter, 72% of our cost of doing business came from three areas; people costs or the investments we make in our tribe; the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion. As a percent of sales, our A&P investment was 5.1% in the third quarter. And then finally, freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers.", "In the third quarter, our cost of doing business increased $2.4 million compared to last year primarily due to $1.2 million in unfavorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Various other items also contributed to the increase in our cost of doing business including increased travel and meeting expenses along with general overhead costs.", "Increased investment in research and development also impacted the cost of doing business in the third quarter. These increases were slightly offset by lower employee-related costs due to lower earned incentive compensation. While our long-term objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30% of net sales, we\u2019ll continue to make the necessary investments in support of our strategic initiative that of operational excellence.", "And that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 23% of net sales in the quarter. That completes our discussion of the 55/30/25 business model for the current quarter. I\u2019ll now discuss a couple of other items worth noting.", "The first, our provision for income tax was 24.3% in the third quarter compared to 28.8% last year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the favorable impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. which became effective for us in the second quarter of this year.", "Based on our initial analysis of the U.S. tax reform but subject to revisions of our provisional amounts, we expect that our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2018 will be in the 22% to 23% range.", "Net income for the third quarter was $16.1 million versus $14.4 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 12%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of about $800,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by 6% compared to last year.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $1.15 in the third quarter compared to $1.02 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13.9 million shares from 14 million shares a year ago.", "Now, a word about our balance sheet and capital allocation. Due to the recent tax law changes in May, we decided we\u2019ll repatriate a portion of our earnings generated abroad. As a result, you will see large fluctuations on our balance sheet between short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents for the current quarter.", "Since our plans are to use the proceeds to pay down a portion of our line of credit in the fourth quarter, we also reclassified $80 million of our line of credit balances from long term to short term as of May 2018. Though we are in the process of repatriating these earnings, our capital allocation strategy remains largely the same and includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing and long-term growth while providing strong returns to our stockholders.", "We typically target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales, but as we previously disclosed, in addition to our normal maintenance CapEx, we have purchased and are in the early stages of renovating an office building to house our UK-based tribe members. In total, this capital expense will cost approximately US$13 million which will be incurred over fiscal years 2018 and 2019.", "We continue to return capital to our stockholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On June 19, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share, payable July 31 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 20. And based on today's closing price of $153.05, the annual dividend yield is 1.4%.", "During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 48,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $6.4 million under our current $75 million share repurchase plan, which was approved by the Board in June of 2016. At the end of the third quarter, we had $26.1 million remaining under the 2016 plan.", "In order for the company to continue its share repurchase activities, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase buyback plan on June 19, 2018 which authorizes the company to acquire up to $75 million of its outstanding shares following the expiration of the current plan and runs through August 31, 2020.", "So with that, let\u2019s turn to the fiscal year 2018 guidance. We are updating our net sales, net income and EPS guidance today only to reflect the recent changes in foreign currency exchange rates. And with that, net sales growth is projected to be between 6% and 8% with net sales expected to be between $403 million and $411 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 55%.", "Advertising and promotion investment is projected to be near 6% of net sales. And net income is projected to be between $56.3 million and $57 million. And diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $4.05 and $4.10 based on an estimated 13.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "This guidance doesn\u2019t include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices will remain close to current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018.", "Now that completes the financial overview. Now, I'll turn it back over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. In summary, here\u2019s some of what you heard on this call today. You heard that we had a 9% net sales growth on a reported basis and a 5% net sales growth on a constant currency basis. You heard that our global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product grew 10% during the quarter. You heard that global sales of WD-40 Specialist grew 16% during the quarter.", "You heard that we reported record EPS of $1.15. You heard that price increases that have been or will be implemented this year are expected to help our gross margin remain in line with our 55/30/25 business model.", "You heard that we decided in May we will repatriate some of our earnings generated abroad and use these proceeds to pay down a portion of our line of credit. You heard that we\u2019ll continue to return capital to our stockholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. And you heard that we have updated our fiscal 2018 guidance to only reflect updated foreign currency exchange rates.", "So today, I\u2019d like to share with you in closing a quote from Nelson Mandela, \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\u201d Thank you for joining us today. We will be pleased now to open the conference call for questions and we\u2019ll go back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Liam Burke from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Garry. Good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, you had strong Specialist sales overall. Understanding that sales are variable from quarter-to-quarter, you did have lower sales in the Americas in Specialist. Is there something related to that or is it just timing of promotion or what was behind that?", "Garry Ridge", "Again, Liam, it\u2019s just a continuation of the process of expansion of Specialist. I\u2019ve shared in the past that you\u2019re going to see it vary from quarter-to-quarter. We are 26% up year-to-date. Specialist sales are now pushing in, I think for the year in the $27 million, $28 million mark. We want to take that to $100 million by 2025, so it\u2019s a journey. And no there\u2019s nothing that concerns us. We continue to build more of that business on a day-to-day basis.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And EZ-REACH in the U.S. was up 12%. You\u2019ve launched that product in Europe, WD-40 Flexible. How has the progress been or is it too early to tell?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019ve launched it in Europe only in Italy and France, and the initial launch was successful. We\u2019re now ramping up our plans to take it further into Europe next year, which is really a plan around production. We have capacity. So we\u2019re now going to be expanding that across a number of other markets in Europe as we roll out our plans in the following fiscal year. So far, very pleased with EZ-REACH everywhere including Australia and France and Italy and the US.", "Liam Burke", "Great. And Jay you mentioned that you\u2019re going to allocate some of your cash to reducing the short-term debt. Can you give us a sense as to how much you plan on reducing that percentage wise or any way here?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, we think it\u2019s about 80 million.", "Liam Burke", "So you\u2019ll reduce that by $80 million.", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, that\u2019s our expectation.", "Liam Burke", "Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Hi, guys. How are you?", "Garry Ridge", "Good, Daniel. How are you?", "Daniel Rizzo", "Doing well. So what\u2019s the range for petroleum prices before you would kind of feel the need to raise your own prices again? Do you have a goal or a range in mind for that?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019re currently kind of at the top end of where we think oil was going to be when we raised our prices. So I think that we\u2019ll be watching it closely. I would suggest that anywhere in the mid-80s is something that would be impactful. We\u2019d need to wait until we see the flow through and the mix of what we\u2019ve already done. I think oil is currently sitting around the $73, $74 mark, so we\u2019ll see how the price rise is impacted as they flow through, but we would think that if it got closer to 85, we might have to do something differently.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then you\u2019ve kept adjusted guidance to account for FX changes or swings. I was just wondering what your assumptions are for FX for the remainder of the year.", "Jay Rembolt", "Essentially that FX rates would remain the same as they are. So if we see much variance from where they are today that would have an impact.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then finally, you indicated you\u2019re expanding your online presence for WD-40 BIKE and doing your digital efforts, and I may [indiscernible] forward, does that include like working with retailers such as Amazon?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. Amazon has been a customer, is a customer with us globally as is eBay, Taobao and most of the new digital players as well as the great work that we\u2019re doing and getting support from our regular customers who are having expanded digital presence. So our investment in digital is to maximize search engine optimization to continue to have digital content that\u2019s driving consumption through education and new uses. We\u2019re very excited about the investment this year and next year and the year after. We have a true determined goal to own digital globally in our category. And the reason we can do that is we\u2019re the only true global brand. So we\u2019re excited about it and we\u2019re pleased to be investing against it.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. I\u2019m sorry, just got one more. So you mentioned that \u2013 I think there was some disruption with three major marketing distributors I think in China or in Asia anyway. Does that just mean you\u2019re shifting \u2013 you\u2019re changing distributors, like you\u2019re changing them out with somebody different, and I was wondering if that\u2019s true, how often that happens?", "Garry Ridge", "Okay. To answer the first part of the question, no, it\u2019s not China. It was in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. We already made the change a number of months ago. But when we changed marketing distributors, there\u2019s a period of time where inventory transfers from the old distributor to the new distributor, and while the new distributor settles into distribution, we tend to have a hiatus in order flow. How often does it happen? When it needs to happen. If you look at our distributor markets globally, we have many, many, many that have been with us for many years, but if we feel that a market needs further development, we analyze that market, we determine whether we should be direct in that market or whether we need to find a new partner that has broader distribution and we make those changes. In Asia-Pacific, a number of years ago we changed out one of our distributors, and that was probably the only time for a while. But it\u2019s not something that we do that regularly but we do it when we need to, when we feel that we need to increase the presence in the market.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Good afternoon, everyone.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi. Nice to hear you.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Just following up on the last question, what was the reason that you had to change? Were they too small distributors in order to be effective given how you are pushing your new products in the region or were they just not efficient?", "Garry Ridge", "It certainly wasn\u2019t the second part. As we look at our 2025 goals we review the capabilities not only internally of our own organization and where we need to make changes but externally. So in one market it was because we believe that we needed to have a different partner to get us to that position in 2025. The second one was because the prior distributor was acquired by a new company. As the acquisition was closed, we didn\u2019t feel that together that our future was one that would deliver the growth, so we decided to make a change.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "I see. So it is not that at the onset when you get started in one particular region you first go with a small distributor in order to get your feel around the need in that particular region then?", "Garry Ridge", "No, not at all.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And then if we look at the pricing you have instituted and some that are coming up, are those catching up with 2017 inflation rate and how much more inflations have you seen so far here to-date and what are you expecting for the full year if you have a feel for that?", "Garry Ridge", "The only area we\u2019re certainly seeing any movement in costs certainly are cans and we\u2019ve shared the impact of that. The other variable really is oil and who knows. Most of the other input costs have been reasonably stable. Right, Jay?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, it depends on the market and we\u2019ve seen some price inflation in the European segments a while back, but most of it is already baked in.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And you gave us the FX impact on overall revenues and you may have given us that impact on maintenance and on Specialist, but I did not catch it. So of the 10% top line growth in maintenance products and the 16% top line growth on Specialist products, what was the FX contribution?", "Garry Ridge", "I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve got that broken out.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "So I did not miss it.", "Garry Ridge", "You did not miss it.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Are you willing to share it so we get a feel?", "Garry Ridge", "We don\u2019t have it with us right now, but I would suggest that the ratio would be the same across all of the product lines.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, so just a little less than half then, right?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And lastly, if I may, what was \u2013 still on the FX side, what was the impact on EPS?", "Jay Rembolt", "I think we gave it on income I believe it was and I think we said that \u2013 I apologize. So our net income without currency \u2013 on a constant currency was up 6% versus the 12% reported.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And then one last one if I may. The tax rate for this year will be for the full year 22% to 23%. Do you have an estimate for 2019 and beyond assuming everything stays the same?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, we think it will be a couple of percentage points lower.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "So around 20?", "Jay Rembolt", "20-ish is probably a number we can \u2013 we haven\u2019t really fully tied it down, but that\u2019s a number that\u2019s in the range for the moment.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, great. Thank you and congratulations.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today's call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge; and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.", "In addition to the financial information presented on today's call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release, and Form 10-Q for the period ending May 31, 2018. These documents are available on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.wd40company.com.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Wendy. Good day everyone and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of 107 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 98.2 million in the third period last year. This reflects an increase of 9% year-over-year.", "Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted our sales in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, we grew net sales by 5% year-over-year. Net income for the third quarter was 16.1 million compared to 14.4 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 12% period-over-period, and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.15 compared to $1.02 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Now let\u2019s start our discussions about our strategic initiatives. As most of you will recall, our long-term revenue target is to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025 and to do so while following our 55/30/25 business model.", "We\u2019d like to remind investors that those long-term targets are guideposts, not guidance. We acknowledge that our anticipated 2025 targets are aspirational, but we continue to believe if we keep our focus in the right places we can be successful in moving towards these targets.", "Our strategic driver number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic driver is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people who will find more uses more frequently.", "In order to achieve our target of 530 million of Multi-Purpose Product revenue, we need to continue our steady building of the Multi-Purpose Product across all markets through both geographic expansion as well as through innovation.", "In the third quarter, global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were 82.5 million reflecting an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were up 8% compared to last year.", "In our developed markets, we continue to drive revenue growth through innovation of our flagship product which includes premiumization. As part of our premiumization strategy, we continue to successfully convert WD-40 Multi-Use Product end users to our more innovative Smart Straw and EZ-REACH delivery systems.", "In developing and emerging markets, we continued to build brand awareness among end users through product sampling, specifically targeted end user groups in countries identified as key growth opportunities. As we\u2019ve shared with investors before, we\u2019re investing an additional 1 million in brand building this fiscal year to support initiatives like these.", "Our strategic driver number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our target under this initiative is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line through continued geographic expansion as well as by developing new products and product categories. Our focus is on building market awareness and distribution of WD-40 Specialist in order to achieve our stated goal of 100 million in revenue by the end of 2025.", "In the third quarter, global sales of WD-40 Specialist were 8.5 million, up 16% compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of Specialist were 23.4 million, up 26% compared to last year.", "We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist. However, there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs as we build out distribution and various other factors that come with building out a new product line.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company, to derive revenue from existing brands as well as from new sources and products.", "Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products of 3-IN-ONE, WD-40 Bike and GT85, but also includes homecare and cleaning product brands like Spot Shot, Lava in the Americas; 1001 in EMEA; and No Vac and Solvol in Asia Pacific. We believe we will continue to nurture and grow the products included under this initiative and expect their combined revenue to reach approximately 70 million by the end of fiscal year 2025.", "In the third quarter, global sales of products included under this initiative were 12.1 million reflecting an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of products included under this initiative were up 6% compared to last year.", "WD-40 BIKE had a particularly strong third quarter with solid sales growth across all three trading blocks. Much of the success we\u2019ve seen with BIKE has been achieved through our growing digital presence. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we\u2019re investing an additional $1 million in brand building this fiscal year and a sizable portion of that investment is being used to support and enhance our global digital presence where products like WD-40 BIKE and other Specialist products thrive.", "Strategic driver number four is to attract, develop, and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop, and retain talented tribe members to grow our tribe member engagement to greater than 95%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 467 tribe members around the globe. To support our tribe\u2019s culture, we launched our Leadership Lab program back in 2011 to develop our tribe, sharpen skills, and ultimately build our company\u2019s bench strength.", "Today, our Leadership Lab is present in all three trading blocks and over 920 attendees have engaged in more than 21,000 hours of learning under this program. We recently announced our next generation approach to Leadership Lab, a learning laboratory that is a global program for people development. These learning tools delivered by our tribe for our tribe are excellent examples of our continued commitment to our thriving global workforce.", "Additionally, I\u2019m happy to share with you that we continue to make progress on our plans for renovating a new building to house our UK-based tribe members and we expect to move the tribe to this new building in the second half of fiscal 2019.", "Finally, our fifth strategic initiative is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, making it better than it is today. We measure ourselves against the operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to processes and systems while safeguarding our brands.", "Volatile commodity prices, particularly those for crude oil, have negatively impacted our gross margins recently but over the long term, our 55/30/25 business model guides our business decisions. Accordingly, we have recently made some proactive price increases to ensure our gross margin will remain within our target ranges over the long term.", "Although some of these price rises were in effect prior to the end of the third quarter, in the Americas the price increases just went into effect in June. As a result, we expect we will begin to see the effect of these price increases reflected in our gross margin in the fourth quarter.", "That completes our update on the strategic initiatives. So let\u2019s move on to in a little more details around our third quarter results starting with sales. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated net sales were 107 million in the third quarter, up 9% versus the third quarter last year.", "Translation of our foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, total net sales would have been 102.6 million, an increase of 5% compared to last year. This is what we refer to as translation-related impacts and it affects reported results from Canada, Australia, China, and the EMEA segment.", "In addition, we experienced about 330,000 unfavorable transaction-related impacts in EMEA which slightly offset the impacts of translation. So in total, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our net sales by about 4.1 million in the third quarter.", "Now we\u2019ll take a closer look at the individual segments and we\u2019ll start with the Americas. Net sales in the Americas, which include the United States, Latin America and Canada, increased to 53 million in the third quarter, up about 8% from last year. Year-to-date, sales in the Americas were up 5% compared to last year.", "Sales of maintenance products increased 12% or 5 million in the Americas, largely due to higher sales of maintenance products in the U.S., Latin America and Canada. Maintenance products sales in the United States increased 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to the timing of customers\u2019 orders as well as a 12% increase in the sales of WD-40 EZ-REACH.", "In addition, maintenance products sales were up 34% in Latin America and 39% in Canada mostly due to the timing of customers\u2019 orders and the successful promotional programs that continue in both regions. We estimate that sales of maintenance products in the Americas were up approximately 2 million in the current quarter due to certain customers buying extra product in advance of the price increase which went into effect in June.", "As a reminder, our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 18% in the third quarter compared to the prior year largely due to lower sales of 2000 Flushes, Spot Shot and Carpet Fresh.", "Now we\u2019ll move over to EMEA. Net sales in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, increased to 39.6 million in the third quarter, up 15% from last year. Year-to-date, net sales in EMEA are up 13% compared to last year. EMEA reported results in the third quarter were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA increased by 4% compared to last year.", "As you know, we sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors. Net sales in EMEA direct markets, which accounted for 66% of the region\u2019s sales, increased 19% during the quarter to US$26.1 million. This increase was a result of increased sales of maintenance products in the region and due to foreign currency exchange rates, new distribution and higher levels of promotional activity.", "Net sales in EMEA distributor markets, which accounted for 34% of the region\u2019s sales, increased 9% during the quarter to US$13.5 million. This increase is primarily due to the timing of customer orders of WD-40 Multi-Use Products in Northern Europe. Partially offset, these increases was a 7% decline in sales in Russia due to the continued instability in the region.", "Russian sales during the quarter were also impacted due to restrictions that were placed on shipments of certain products into Russia during the World Cup. These continued challenges in Russia are preventing the distributor market from realizing even higher levels of growth year-over-year.", "Now we\u2019ll go down to Asia-Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China, and other countries in the region, decreased to 14.4 million in the third quarter, down 2% from last year. Year-to-date, net sales in Asia-Pacific were up 3% compared to last year.", "Asia-Pacific\u2019s reported results in the third quarter were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia-Pacific decreased by 5% compared to last year.", "In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were 4.7 million in the third quarter, up 5% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for Australia in the period. This increase in sales was driven primarily by successful promotional activities and the expanded distribution of WD-40 Specialist product line in Australia.", "In our Asia distributor markets, net sales were 5.5 million in the quarter, down 17% compared to last year. Our marketing distributor business in Asia-Pacific has been negatively impacted due to the transitioning of three major marketing distributor partners in the region. This transition has caused the disruption in the region but we believe that we are through the worst part of that transition and that the region will return to growth in the fourth quarter. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell our products in U.S. dollars in the region.", "In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were 4.2 million in the third quarter, up 17% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on these sales. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased 8% period-to-period. The increase in sales was primarily due to successful promotional programs that are ongoing and conducted during the third quarter of this year.", "We remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities in China, although we do expect volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "Now that's it for me. I'm going to pass over to Jay who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thanks, Garry. First, let's review the 55/30/25 business model. These are the long-term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be at 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our goal is to drive our cost of doing business over time toward 30% of net sales. And finally, the 25 which represents EBITDA.", "Let\u2019s look at the 55 or our gross margin. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 55.8% compared to 55.3% last year. This represents a decline of 50 basis points and for the first time in a few years that our gross margin has dipped below our long-term target of 55%. Changes in major input costs, which include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, was the primary driver of this decline and negatively impacted our margin by 140 basis points.", "As you know, crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals and recently we\u2019ve experienced rising oil costs which have put pressure on our cost of goods in all three of our trading blocks. Rising petroleum-based specialty chemical costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 100 basis points in the quarter.", "Also contributing negatively to our gross margin by 40 basis points was the increased cost of aerosol cans. In addition, gross margin was also negatively impacted by 40% due to higher warehousing and inbound freight costs, mostly in the Americas segment and primarily due to the freight market in the U.S.", "Promotion and other discounts that we give our customers also negatively impacted gross margin by 30 basis points. Then finally we had changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by 20 points due to fluctuations in exchange rates for the euro and U.S. dollar against the pound sterling in our EMEA segment. This is because in EMEA, our cost of goods are sourced primarily in pound sterling or approximately 70% of our revenues are generated in currencies other than the pound sterling.", "These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by the combined effects of favorable sales mix changes and decreases in other miscellaneous costs primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments which positively impacted gross margin by 130 basis points. In addition, sales price increases which we implemented in EMEA and Asia-Pacific over the last 12 months positively impacted gross margin by 50 basis points.", "Continually rising input costs have made it necessary for us to review our pricing structure and implement price increases in each of our trade blocks. The price increases in the Americas will take effect in the fourth quarter of this year and will begin to be reflected on our gross margin in coming quarters.", "In the near term, we expect with these price increases in place we can manage gross margin at a level that is near our target of 55%. Unfortunately, due to the recent volatility in the price of crude oil, it is uncertain the level to which our gross margin will be impacted over the short term. However, we will continue to be focused and deliberate in managing our business so that we can maintain our gross margin at a level that is above our target of 55% over the long term.", "Now I\u2019ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the third quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 32% compared to 33% last year. Revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving our long-term target of 30%. In the third quarter of this year, our reported revenue increase positively affected our cost of doing business percentage.", "And for the third quarter, 72% of our cost of doing business came from three areas; people costs or the investments we make in our tribe; the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion. As a percent of sales, our A&P investment was 5.1% in the third quarter. And then finally, freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers.", "In the third quarter, our cost of doing business increased $2.4 million compared to last year primarily due to $1.2 million in unfavorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Various other items also contributed to the increase in our cost of doing business including increased travel and meeting expenses along with general overhead costs.", "Increased investment in research and development also impacted the cost of doing business in the third quarter. These increases were slightly offset by lower employee-related costs due to lower earned incentive compensation. While our long-term objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30% of net sales, we\u2019ll continue to make the necessary investments in support of our strategic initiative that of operational excellence.", "And that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 23% of net sales in the quarter. That completes our discussion of the 55/30/25 business model for the current quarter. I\u2019ll now discuss a couple of other items worth noting.", "The first, our provision for income tax was 24.3% in the third quarter compared to 28.8% last year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the favorable impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. which became effective for us in the second quarter of this year.", "Based on our initial analysis of the U.S. tax reform but subject to revisions of our provisional amounts, we expect that our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2018 will be in the 22% to 23% range.", "Net income for the third quarter was $16.1 million versus $14.4 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 12%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of about $800,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by 6% compared to last year.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $1.15 in the third quarter compared to $1.02 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13.9 million shares from 14 million shares a year ago.", "Now, a word about our balance sheet and capital allocation. Due to the recent tax law changes in May, we decided we\u2019ll repatriate a portion of our earnings generated abroad. As a result, you will see large fluctuations on our balance sheet between short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents for the current quarter.", "Since our plans are to use the proceeds to pay down a portion of our line of credit in the fourth quarter, we also reclassified $80 million of our line of credit balances from long term to short term as of May 2018. Though we are in the process of repatriating these earnings, our capital allocation strategy remains largely the same and includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing and long-term growth while providing strong returns to our stockholders.", "We typically target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales, but as we previously disclosed, in addition to our normal maintenance CapEx, we have purchased and are in the early stages of renovating an office building to house our UK-based tribe members. In total, this capital expense will cost approximately US$13 million which will be incurred over fiscal years 2018 and 2019.", "We continue to return capital to our stockholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On June 19, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share, payable July 31 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 20. And based on today's closing price of $153.05, the annual dividend yield is 1.4%.", "During the third quarter, we repurchased just over 48,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $6.4 million under our current $75 million share repurchase plan, which was approved by the Board in June of 2016. At the end of the third quarter, we had $26.1 million remaining under the 2016 plan.", "In order for the company to continue its share repurchase activities, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase buyback plan on June 19, 2018 which authorizes the company to acquire up to $75 million of its outstanding shares following the expiration of the current plan and runs through August 31, 2020.", "So with that, let\u2019s turn to the fiscal year 2018 guidance. We are updating our net sales, net income and EPS guidance today only to reflect the recent changes in foreign currency exchange rates. And with that, net sales growth is projected to be between 6% and 8% with net sales expected to be between $403 million and $411 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 55%.", "Advertising and promotion investment is projected to be near 6% of net sales. And net income is projected to be between $56.3 million and $57 million. And diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $4.05 and $4.10 based on an estimated 13.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "This guidance doesn\u2019t include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices will remain close to current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018.", "Now that completes the financial overview. Now, I'll turn it back over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. In summary, here\u2019s some of what you heard on this call today. You heard that we had a 9% net sales growth on a reported basis and a 5% net sales growth on a constant currency basis. You heard that our global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product grew 10% during the quarter. You heard that global sales of WD-40 Specialist grew 16% during the quarter.", "You heard that we reported record EPS of $1.15. You heard that price increases that have been or will be implemented this year are expected to help our gross margin remain in line with our 55/30/25 business model.", "You heard that we decided in May we will repatriate some of our earnings generated abroad and use these proceeds to pay down a portion of our line of credit. You heard that we\u2019ll continue to return capital to our stockholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. And you heard that we have updated our fiscal 2018 guidance to only reflect updated foreign currency exchange rates.", "So today, I\u2019d like to share with you in closing a quote from Nelson Mandela, \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\u201d Thank you for joining us today. We will be pleased now to open the conference call for questions and we\u2019ll go back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Liam Burke from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Garry. Good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, you had strong Specialist sales overall. Understanding that sales are variable from quarter-to-quarter, you did have lower sales in the Americas in Specialist. Is there something related to that or is it just timing of promotion or what was behind that?", "Garry Ridge", "Again, Liam, it\u2019s just a continuation of the process of expansion of Specialist. I\u2019ve shared in the past that you\u2019re going to see it vary from quarter-to-quarter. We are 26% up year-to-date. Specialist sales are now pushing in, I think for the year in the $27 million, $28 million mark. We want to take that to $100 million by 2025, so it\u2019s a journey. And no there\u2019s nothing that concerns us. We continue to build more of that business on a day-to-day basis.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And EZ-REACH in the U.S. was up 12%. You\u2019ve launched that product in Europe, WD-40 Flexible. How has the progress been or is it too early to tell?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019ve launched it in Europe only in Italy and France, and the initial launch was successful. We\u2019re now ramping up our plans to take it further into Europe next year, which is really a plan around production. We have capacity. So we\u2019re now going to be expanding that across a number of other markets in Europe as we roll out our plans in the following fiscal year. So far, very pleased with EZ-REACH everywhere including Australia and France and Italy and the US.", "Liam Burke", "Great. And Jay you mentioned that you\u2019re going to allocate some of your cash to reducing the short-term debt. Can you give us a sense as to how much you plan on reducing that percentage wise or any way here?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, we think it\u2019s about 80 million.", "Liam Burke", "So you\u2019ll reduce that by $80 million.", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, that\u2019s our expectation.", "Liam Burke", "Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Hi, guys. How are you?", "Garry Ridge", "Good, Daniel. How are you?", "Daniel Rizzo", "Doing well. So what\u2019s the range for petroleum prices before you would kind of feel the need to raise your own prices again? Do you have a goal or a range in mind for that?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019re currently kind of at the top end of where we think oil was going to be when we raised our prices. So I think that we\u2019ll be watching it closely. I would suggest that anywhere in the mid-80s is something that would be impactful. We\u2019d need to wait until we see the flow through and the mix of what we\u2019ve already done. I think oil is currently sitting around the $73, $74 mark, so we\u2019ll see how the price rise is impacted as they flow through, but we would think that if it got closer to 85, we might have to do something differently.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then you\u2019ve kept adjusted guidance to account for FX changes or swings. I was just wondering what your assumptions are for FX for the remainder of the year.", "Jay Rembolt", "Essentially that FX rates would remain the same as they are. So if we see much variance from where they are today that would have an impact.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then finally, you indicated you\u2019re expanding your online presence for WD-40 BIKE and doing your digital efforts, and I may [indiscernible] forward, does that include like working with retailers such as Amazon?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. Amazon has been a customer, is a customer with us globally as is eBay, Taobao and most of the new digital players as well as the great work that we\u2019re doing and getting support from our regular customers who are having expanded digital presence. So our investment in digital is to maximize search engine optimization to continue to have digital content that\u2019s driving consumption through education and new uses. We\u2019re very excited about the investment this year and next year and the year after. We have a true determined goal to own digital globally in our category. And the reason we can do that is we\u2019re the only true global brand. So we\u2019re excited about it and we\u2019re pleased to be investing against it.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. I\u2019m sorry, just got one more. So you mentioned that \u2013 I think there was some disruption with three major marketing distributors I think in China or in Asia anyway. Does that just mean you\u2019re shifting \u2013 you\u2019re changing distributors, like you\u2019re changing them out with somebody different, and I was wondering if that\u2019s true, how often that happens?", "Garry Ridge", "Okay. To answer the first part of the question, no, it\u2019s not China. It was in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. We already made the change a number of months ago. But when we changed marketing distributors, there\u2019s a period of time where inventory transfers from the old distributor to the new distributor, and while the new distributor settles into distribution, we tend to have a hiatus in order flow. How often does it happen? When it needs to happen. If you look at our distributor markets globally, we have many, many, many that have been with us for many years, but if we feel that a market needs further development, we analyze that market, we determine whether we should be direct in that market or whether we need to find a new partner that has broader distribution and we make those changes. In Asia-Pacific, a number of years ago we changed out one of our distributors, and that was probably the only time for a while. But it\u2019s not something that we do that regularly but we do it when we need to, when we feel that we need to increase the presence in the market.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Good afternoon, everyone.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi. Nice to hear you.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Just following up on the last question, what was the reason that you had to change? Were they too small distributors in order to be effective given how you are pushing your new products in the region or were they just not efficient?", "Garry Ridge", "It certainly wasn\u2019t the second part. As we look at our 2025 goals we review the capabilities not only internally of our own organization and where we need to make changes but externally. So in one market it was because we believe that we needed to have a different partner to get us to that position in 2025. The second one was because the prior distributor was acquired by a new company. As the acquisition was closed, we didn\u2019t feel that together that our future was one that would deliver the growth, so we decided to make a change.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "I see. So it is not that at the onset when you get started in one particular region you first go with a small distributor in order to get your feel around the need in that particular region then?", "Garry Ridge", "No, not at all.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And then if we look at the pricing you have instituted and some that are coming up, are those catching up with 2017 inflation rate and how much more inflations have you seen so far here to-date and what are you expecting for the full year if you have a feel for that?", "Garry Ridge", "The only area we\u2019re certainly seeing any movement in costs certainly are cans and we\u2019ve shared the impact of that. The other variable really is oil and who knows. Most of the other input costs have been reasonably stable. Right, Jay?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, it depends on the market and we\u2019ve seen some price inflation in the European segments a while back, but most of it is already baked in.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And you gave us the FX impact on overall revenues and you may have given us that impact on maintenance and on Specialist, but I did not catch it. So of the 10% top line growth in maintenance products and the 16% top line growth on Specialist products, what was the FX contribution?", "Garry Ridge", "I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve got that broken out.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "So I did not miss it.", "Garry Ridge", "You did not miss it.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Are you willing to share it so we get a feel?", "Garry Ridge", "We don\u2019t have it with us right now, but I would suggest that the ratio would be the same across all of the product lines.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, so just a little less than half then, right?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And lastly, if I may, what was \u2013 still on the FX side, what was the impact on EPS?", "Jay Rembolt", "I think we gave it on income I believe it was and I think we said that \u2013 I apologize. So our net income without currency \u2013 on a constant currency was up 6% versus the 12% reported.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And then one last one if I may. The tax rate for this year will be for the full year 22% to 23%. Do you have an estimate for 2019 and beyond assuming everything stays the same?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, we think it will be a couple of percentage points lower.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "So around 20?", "Jay Rembolt", "20-ish is probably a number we can \u2013 we haven\u2019t really fully tied it down, but that\u2019s a number that\u2019s in the range for the moment.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, great. Thank you and congratulations.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

Good day and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of 96.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which was an increase of 4% from Q3 of last fiscal year. Net income for the third quarter was 12.7 million compared to 11 million in Q3 last year, an increase of 16%. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.88 compared to $0.75 for the same period last fiscal year.", "As we review our results for the third quarter, we will be doing so under the umbrella of our 55/30/25 rule and our strategic initiatives. So before we dive into the sales results, let me take a moment to review our strategic initiatives, as well as our long-term targets. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places, for more people who will find more usage more frequently. We believe we can grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product to approximately 600 million globally in revenue over the next 10 years. Global sales of Multi-Use Product were up 7% this quarter compared to last year, this increase was due to solid sales growth of the Multi-Use Product in all three trading blocks. This growth was primarily attributed to successful promotional programs we run in our Asian distributor markets, a change we made to our distribution model in our Germanics region, and sales of WD-40 EZ-REACH in United States, which continues to exceed our original expectation.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the Shield to develop Use Products and categories within identified geographies and platforms. We believe we can grow WD-40 Specialist to approximately 125 million in revenue over the next 10 years. In the third quarter, sales of WD-40 Specialist were 5.6 million, which represents an 8% increase over the third quarter of last year. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist product line. However, there will be some volatility and sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the launch of new product offerings, and the building of new distribution.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from new sources and brands. During the third quarter, we continued to broaden the distribution, our products like 3-IN-ONE and WD-40 Bike and GT85 and we expect overtime they will continue to contribute to our long-term goals. We are excited about some new initiatives coming soon for the 3-IN-ONE brand, and we look forward to sharing those with you in future quarters.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our long-term target under this initiative is to grow employee engagement to greater than 95%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 440 tribe members globally. Recently, we made an important decision that we believe will help us reach our long-term employee engagement goal. Let me take you back in time for a moment. 1973 was a big year for WD-40 Company. Two things happened, we completed our IPO and we moved into our current global headquarters in San Diego. Since that time, we've grown the San Diego corporate tribe from just a handful of people to roughly 20 employees. In addition to our corporate employees, our San Diego facility also houses about 100 tribe members from our Americas trading block.", "For 40 years, we've attempted to make our current facility work by adding on additional square footage and leasing extra office space nearby. This has resulted in a work environment that limits collaboration, has inadequate meeting spaces and quite frankly, is not the best work environment. That's why we have decided it's time to invest in a new facility for both our corporate and Americas tribe members. We have identified a property in San Diego area, which we intend to purchase and we expect to make a capital investment associated with the purchase of about $15 million in the next year. We look forward to keeping you updated on this exciting project in the coming months.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, make it better than it is today. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems and processes, as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection. During the third quarter we successfully completed the transition of all 50 U.S. States to the lower VOC formula we launched in California in fiscal year 2014. We also made some distribution changes in our German market. Historically in this market, we had a large wholesale customer who distributed our products to many of the DIY retailers in the region. We've made a change in this market, which now enables us to sell to some of those retailers directly. The tribe in Germany is doing just a great job managing the transition and as a result has seen a 22% increase in sales this quarter.", "That completes the update on strategic initiatives. So, let\u2019s move on to the details of our third quarter results starting with sales. As I mentioned before, consolidated net sales were 96.4 million in the third quarter, up 3.9 million or 4% versus last year. As you know, we focused all our time, talent, treasure on technology on growing our maintenance products. In the third quarter, sales of maintenance products were nearly 87 million, which represents a 6% increase from last year. In the third quarter, we generated approximately 38% of our sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changing foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind for us, albeit a smaller in the current quarter. If we were able to remove all foreign currency exchange impacts, our consolidated revenue would have been 97.6 million, up 6% compared to the third quarter last year.", "Consolidated net sales were reduced by about 2.8 million, due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against functional currencies of our subsidiaries. This is what we refer to as translational related exposure or constant currency. And it impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China and the EMEA segment. However, due to changing foreign currency exchange rates, our consolidated net sales were actually improved this quarter by about 1.6 million in transaction related exposure. This currency exposure impacts reported results in our EMEA segment and was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling.", "Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at what is happening in the individual segments. We will start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas, which includes the United States, Latin America and Canada remained relatively constant at 49.9 million in the third quarter. Changes in foreign currency did not have a material impact on sales in the Americas from period-to-period. Sales of maintenance products increased by 3% in the Americas, primarily due to the strong sales in the U.S., where maintenance product sales increased about 5% benefitting from added distribution of WD-40 EZ-REACH. These increases were partially offset by declines in maintenance product sales in Canada, which were down 16% during the quarter. These declines were primarily due to lower sales associated with unstable market and economic conditions in Western Canada, as a result of suppressed activity in the oil industry. Maintenance products sales in Latin America were flat compared to last year.", "Our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products. We continue to consider our homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S. as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows, but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business overtime. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas during the third quarter decreased about 13% from last year.", "Now over to EMEA, consolidated net sales in EMEA which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, increased to 32.9 million in the third quarter, up about 9% from last year. On a constant currency basis sales in EMEA would have increased 4.8 million or 16% compared to the prior year. As you know, we sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations, as well as through marketing distributors. And reported consolidated sales in our EMEA direct markets which accounted for 68% of the region sales, increased 9% during the quarter to 22.3 million. However, it's also helpful to look at the results in local currencies in which we conduct transactions in the direct markets.", "In the United Kingdom, our pound sterling based market total sales increased 1% in the quarter. In local currencies, pound sterling based market saw a 3% increase in sales of the maintenance products. However, these increases were almost entirely offset by a 6% decline in homecare and cleaning products. In euro based direct markets sales in euros increased by 15% in the quarter.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our EMEA distributor markets, which account for 32% of EMEA sales during the quarter. Distributor market sales increased 7% in the third quarter to 10.6 million, primarily due to improved market conditions in Eastern Europe. Although, market conditions have begun to stabilize in Russia, we'd like to remind you that is that the political and economic instability in the region makes it difficult for us to predict what level of sales we'll have in the near future.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at Asia-Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific which includes Australia, China and other countries in the outright Asian region, increased to 13.6 million in the third quarter, up 10% from last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia-Pacific would have been 14.1 million, an increase of 14% compared to last year. In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were 4.3 million in the third quarter, flat compared to last year. In its functional currency, the Australian dollar, sales increased 6% for the quarter. This growth was primarily due to a higher level of promotional programs.", "In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were 3.4 million in the third quarter, down 5% compared to last year. In its functional currency, the Chinese RMB, sales were up 1% for the quarter. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in the China region. Although, we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "In our Asian distributor markets, net sales were 5.9 million in the quarter, up 32% compared to last year. This increase in sales was driven by successful promotional programs for WD-40 Multi-Use Product. However, the significant increase is also due to the fact that in the comparable period last year, we encountered a quality issue linked to a defective aerosol can component that required us to record an allowance of 900,000 during that quarter. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency translations since we sell in U.S. dollars in those markets.", "So I'm going to take a break and now I'm going to hand over to Jay who will continue the review of the financials. Thanks Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hi, Gary, thank you. First, let\u2019s review our 55/30/25 Rule. Those are the long-term horizon targets that we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be a 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales. Finally, the 25 represents EBITDA. Well, if our gross margin is a 55% and our cost of business is a 30%, our EBITDA will be awfully close to 25%. First the 55 or gross margin, in the third quarter our gross margin was 56.8% compared to the 53.3% last year. Our gross margin was positively impacted by 200 basis points from major input costs and 160 basis points and various other items.", "Let's begin with the major inputs costs, which include, our petroleum based specialty chemicals, and aerosol cans, crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based chemicals. Our gross margin this quarter reflects the lowest cost we've seen in well over a decade. As you may recall and we've shared with you in the past, it takes considerable time approximately 90 to 120 days for changing commodity prices to impact our cost of goods sold. The cost of crude declined sharply in the second quarter of this fiscal year, and this significantly benefited our gross margin in our third quarter. Since the beginning of the third quarter however the price of oil has risen by more than 60% and as a result of this recent trend, we do not expect to realize the same level of benefit to gross margin in future quarters. As a remainder, our long-term gross margin target of 55% is not contingent upon oil staying at any particular price point. We cannot control global market dynamics such as the price of crude oil or fluctuating currencies, but we can continue to be focused and deliberate in managing the rest of our business so that we can maintain gross margin at a level close to our target over the long-term.", "Well let's briefly talk about some of the other items that impacted gross margin in the third quarter. Advertising, promotional and other discounts that we give to our customers, decreased compared to last year, positively affecting our gross margin by 100 basis points. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our gross margin by 60 basis points. This is because, in EMEA our cost of goods are sourced in pound sterling, while approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros with 30% in pound sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars. The combined effect of the strengthening of both the euro and the U.S. dollar gives the pound sterling to cause the revenues in total to be worth more in pound sterling this quarter, thus improving our gross margin. These improvements to gross margin were partially offset by some sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs, which combined had a negative impact on gross margin of 10 basis points.", "Now, I'll address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the third quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 36% compared to 34% last year. SG&A increased 10% compared to last year, which negatively impacted our cost of doing business percentage. This increase is primarily attributable to higher employee related costs associated with higher accruals for earned incentive compensation, compared to last year. While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative, operational excellence. And that includes investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard the blue and yellow can with a little red top. We expect to move closer to our long-term target of 30% overtime as revenues grow.", "For the third quarter, 77% of our cost of doing business came from three areas; people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion. As a percentage of our sales, our A&P expense investment this quarter was 6.4%. And finally freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers.", "Well that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 22% of net sales for the third quarter compared to 19% in the third quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by the improvements to gross margin I discussed earlier.", "Well, that includes our discussion of our 55/30/25 business model for the current quarter. I\u2019ll now discuss a couple of other items worth noting. The provision for income taxes was 28.1% in the third quarter compared to 30.2% last year. The lower tax rate was driven by increased taxable earnings generated from foreign operations, which are being taxed at lower rates. Net income for the third quarter was $12.7 million versus $11 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of about $300,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.88 in the quarter compared to $0.75 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted shares outstanding decreased to 14.3 million shares from 14.6 million shares a year ago.", "Now, a word about capital allocation, our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balancing both investing in long-term growth and providing strong returns to our shareholders. We charge at maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales for our fiscal year. Although as Gary discussed earlier, we are planning to buy a new office building to house our San Diego based tribe members. Therefore, in addition to our maintenance CapEx we anticipate making a one-time investment of approximately 15 million next fiscal year.", "On a personal note, I'm very excited about this project, it will enable us to put an additional $10 million in long-term debt on our balance sheet and this investment we're making in the future of our tribe. In addition, we continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On June 21st, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share payable July 29th to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 15th. Based on today's closing price of $115.89 the annualized dividend yield is 1.45%.", "During the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 91,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of approximately $9.6 million under our share repurchase plan. Our March 2015 repurchase plan provides authorization to acquire up to $75 million of the Company's outstanding shares through the planned expiration date of August 31, 2016. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $34.6 million remaining under the plan. In order for the Company to continue our share repurchase activities our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback plan on June 21, 2016 which authorizes the Company to acquire up to $75 million of its outstanding shares, following the expiration of the current plan and through an end date of August 31, 2018.", "Now let's briefly talk about our current affairs in the United Kingdom. As the U.S. based company is generating approximately 38% of our revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, dramatic shifts in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on our reported results. Clearly, the vote in Britain last month has put a lot of uncertainty into the markets. We don't know what the future holds, but we will share with you in a moment how we think shifting currency exchange rates in particular a significantly lower pound sterling will impact our fiscal year 2016 guidance. Aside from volatility on the foreign currency exchange rates, there're so many moving pieces and unknowns and so much that has to happen in order for Britain to exit the European Union. The good news is that we have a very geographically diverse business. We have weathered a variety of economic crisis over the last 60 years and we've always come out fine. Brexit is another event for us to navigate through.", "So with that let's turn to fiscal year 2016 guidance. We've updated some of our guidance to reflect our current view of the business. As a reminder this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and assumes that crude oil prices will remain close to current levels for the remainder of the year. The assumptions used in this guidance have been adjusted as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates to accommodate the current events in the UK.", "Net sales are projected to be slightly above fiscal 2015 or between $378 million and $383 million, gross margin for the full fiscal year is expected to be about 55%, advertising and promotional investments are projected to be near 6%. Net income is projected to be between 49 million and 50 million. And diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.40 and $3.47 based on an estimated 14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "Now that completes the financial overview, I'll turn it back to Gary.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. Let me sum up with what we hope you heard on the call today. You've heard that foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind, albeit a weaker one and they reduced our net sales by about 1.2 million in the third quarter. You heard that globally maintenance product sales grew 6% this quarter. You heard that the Americas segment is performing well and in line with our expectations with a 3% growth of maintenance products sales this quarter. You heard that third quarter global sales of WD-40 Specialist were 5.6 million which represents an 8% increase over the third quarter of last year. You heard that most of our EMEA direct markets reported solid double-digit sales growth and that we are seeing some recovery of market conditions in Eastern Europe. You heard that crude oil prices have trended up from recent lows and therefore we expect some pressure on gross margin in the coming quarters. You heard that we'll be making a capital investment of approximately $15 million in order to purchase a new office building for our San Diego-based tribe members to call home. You heard that our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback plan that authorizes the Company to acquire up to 75 million of its outstanding shares through 2018. You heard that there is a lot of uncertainty around the British exit from the EU. Despite some currency related headwinds that we\u2019re likely to encounter, the underlying business will endure because we still see that there are squeaks in the United Kingdom and in other countries in the European Union. You heard that we have revised our fiscal year 2000 guidance to reflect our current view of market conditions in the business.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to share a quote with you from our famous San Diegan Dr. Seuss. Sometimes you\u2019ll never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory. Let's wish the memory of the UK a good one. Thanks for joining us on the call today. And being an Aussie I could say God thank the Queen. We\u2019ll now be pleased to open the conference for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, could you give us a sense how the emerging markets are doing particularly China. You talked a bit about Asia-Pacific, you talked about currency. But how is the, generally how is the market doing in China?", "Garry Ridge", "We continue to build distribution in China, in fact Liam after this call today I\u2019m headed to LA and I\u2019ll be on a flight to Shanghai and I\u2019ll have a fresh view. But we are still comfortable and confident that we will build the business in China overtime that\u2019s going to be worth about $100 million as we see it today. So we don\u2019t see anything that would tell us it\u2019s any different other than events that we\u2019re unaware of. So China to us continues to be a focused growth market and the thing that gives me Goosebumps is this morning someone in China woke up and met WD-40 for the first time and if that continues to happen we\u2019ll be fine.", "Liam Burke", "And in terms of the new product innovation is a big push for your incremental revenue growth. How is the new product pipeline looking, I mean without being specific but I mean a lot of these things you\u2019d like to wait until the last night before announcing, but how does the pipeline look?", "Garry Ridge", "It looks very solid. I just attended our 12 month rolling planning meeting a week ago and was witnessed to some of the very exciting products that are getting ready to launch later this year and early next year. So the pipeline is solid and we\u2019re optimistic. The other thing that we\u2019re really happy about Liam is even with all the noise and everything that\u2019s going on in the world. Our multi-purpose maintenance products year-to-date are up 4% globally. And that takes into account all these other events that are happened when you strip out the impact of currency. So our strategy is to drive our focus of time, talent, treasure and technology, on activity that we see to be the most opportunity and that\u2019s growing the blue and yellow can and then using the power of the Shield to grow Specialist and we know what our circle of competence is and we\u2019re not going to get outside that. So we feel good in the world we will deal with events as they come.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "So in terms of the UK and the devaluation of the British pound, I know that that has a couple of different effects on your income statement, top-line effects as well as, I think it\u2019s going to be a positive, a favorable growth margin effect because of the cost side. Can you maybe just go over what those effects are just so we\u2019re all clear on the nature of those impacts?", "Garry Ridge", "I\u2019ll let Jay handle that.", "Jay Rembolt", "Well, I think you\u2019re exactly right that as the pound weakens against dollar and the euro, what happens is the sterling results, which the -- all of our European businesses denominated sterling results. They get translated over at lower rates. So that effects top-line, middle-line and bottom-line. However, in sterling, you\u2019re right that\u2019s the lower or the weekend sterling results in higher sales in non-sterling currencies in that market and that\u2019s does impact in benefit gross margin. So there is a little offset.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "So net-net, is the British pound devaluation a positive or a negative to net income for your Company?", "Jay Rembolt", "It would be a net-net negative, but although a small one.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay, got you. And then of course we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with aftereffects in the economy in Europe, but is it safe to say that if the economy were to soften that your product I mean it's an industrial type product, I mean your business would be somewhat impacted by that if that were to happen, is that the way to think about it?", "Garry Ridge", "We don't know, Linda. I mean he who runs business by the crystal ball lens to a glass, I would say we been through different economic and whatever periods overtime. I think it's a shambolic condition in Europe right now and we don\u2019t and I am not smart enough to predict it. Right now, early indications are we're not seeing evidence of that, but who knows, time will tell we'll know more in a few -- little time. We've grown in past years through most financial crises that there are and it's because of our global diversity and the diversity of our business across multiple trade channels. Sure, industrial is a big part of our business, but DIY is a huge part of that business so is automotive, so is marine, so is farming. So, we feel blessed to have that shield if you will excuse the pun, but we'll see what happens.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then just in terms of the gross margin pressure that you mentioned in your press release that we shouldn't expect this high level to continue so when you talk about pressure, I assume you mean coming down off this high growth margin level, but doesn't that mean though you still to be up year-over-year for a couple more quarters, I am picturing first half 2017 maybe up, but then second half down year-over-year, is that, am I thinking of that correctly?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, certainly we could be up for another couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis and we would just expect that given the current cost and the current market. What we saw, however, though in our third quarter was some very unusually low prices that were in the market in our second quarter and when that flowed into our cost of goods this quarter it -- we don't see those likely repeating. However, if we do see it oil fallback to that point, we would see similar opportunities in future. Now there was a period of time Linda you probably may remember in the January-February-March time, when oil was in the high 20s, low 30s. It's now up around 40 to 50, or high 40s to 50s. So we could see some of that impact in this quarter.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then you had mentioned that you adopted a new modeling something in the Germanics I didn't quite catch what that was? I mean that\u2019s a -- you're not using distributors there I don't think, and can you explain is that strong growth was like a onetime channel fill or is that strong growth going to continue do you think?", "Garry Ridge", "Basically it's an evolution of the market, in the Germanics and it's happened elsewhere as we build markets, but sometimes we use wholesalers to sell into major retail chains, so we don\u2019t -- I mean it's a direct market but we would sell to a theater or a wholesaler who would then sell into a retail chain. The reason being you have to have a certain velocity within a retail chain for it to be economical for us to service that retail chain directly and in some cases they didn't have their own internal distribution that was aligned to the way we sell. So in the DIY trade channel in Germany, we are converting to direct supply to people like Bell House and OB and whatever. And in doing that, we get closer to the customer we're able to expand the product offering and take in more sizes and more product like Specialist and Bike and we\u2019ve been in the early stages of doing that all this year, so we're going to continue we think to see some pretty good growth in that channel in Germany for a while to come. And as part of our strategy and that we've identified for a while now that Germany is the second biggest DIY market in the world. And we're only about 65% of our potential in that trade channel, so this was a strategic move to start to accelerate our expansion in that trade channel.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "And then just the Canada weakness I mean you kind of mentioned that again, I guess that's related to the oil industry weakness, so does the trend there is it looking like it's getting worse or better or just what do you think?", "Garry Ridge", "Canada has been a basket case this year and I feel for our tribe members up there. They\u2019ve done a lot of hard work and they fought a hard battle, where we see it's kind of stabilizing but it is the oil going to -- is oil going to regenerate activity in the west, I don't know. But we're going to lap a bad year so hopefully it won\u2019t look so bad next year, but it's been a tough year for our folks up in Canada and we're hopeful that we'll get through this and next year will be better.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "And then I guess the distributor markets in the EMEA like the Russia and all that that was up about what mid single-digit in the quarter? Is that, do you consider that then a recovered level of business activity so we could see modest growth then going forward do you think?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, as far as Russia is concerned, I don't think Russia is out of the -- out of where it should be now, the sales remain depressed, the economic sanctions and lower oil prices have led Russia into a deep recession. Some experts believe the economy in Russia will start to grow in calendar year 2017, but even with the growth rate being relatively low maybe 1% to 2%, in the third quarter our sales were up nearly 31% in Russia over the last year, but this was less to do with the Russian market improving dramatically, meaning there were more to do with the fact we've been experiencing, in our Russia distributor markets from Q3 '15 because that's when the economic crisis began. So, we -- I think it'll take us a while to get back to where we were in Russia. I think it's -- we've seen over two quarters now, a flattening out of the downtrend if you will. So, hopefully we'll just have to take it step-by-step as that economy gets better overtime.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "And then just lastly you made it clear that you\u2019ll have this 15 million CapEx investment next year for the new headquarters and you're adding some debt, so does that imply that your usual share repurchase level could be expected to remain as expected you wouldn't change it just because of that?", "Garry Ridge", "That would be our expectation. We see the activity that's taken place over the last five years to continue and we see the -- and our dividend policy is unchanged and as Jay said he's personally happy with this because he can put a bit of long-term debt on the balance sheet, and put the balance sheet to work for a good purpose.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today's conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

Mitchell", "", "Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call for fiscal 2010.  Today we are pleased to have Gary Ridge, President and CEO and Jay Rembolt, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company\u2019s outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results.  These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company.", "Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements including the impact and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of new product introductions and the uncertainty in economic conditions both in the United States and internationally.

", "Our second quarter fiscal 2010 earnings conference call is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, April 7, 2010 at 2PM.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Ridge.", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Today we reported net sales of $77.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, a decrease of 7% over Q1 of last fiscal year.   Net income for the first quarter was $9.5 million, up 22.5% compared to Q1 of last fiscal year.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up from $0.46 in Q1 of last fiscal year.", "Before I get in to more detail about the last quarter I want to spend a few minutes on the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve adopted and shared with you in our annual shareholder meeting and our annual shareholder letter.  There are four major strategies that are getting the most of our time, talent and treasure to drive our growth, we call them the fantastic four.  Strategy is defined by us as the how to over a given time frame.  These strategic initiatives are aligned to achieve our vision which is our brands will create positive lasting memories as they become solutions that doers and on the job users around the world turn to first to get the job done.", "By doing so we will provide attractive economic returns for our stakeholders and meaningful work and opportunity for our trip members.  We remain focused on committing our time, talent and treasure to our core strategic initiatives.  The fantastic four are number one, global expansion, continuing our efforts to expand around the world by helping end users in emerging and developing countries solve rust, squeak and other maintenance issues.  Number two, maximizing our position in the multipurpose maintenance product segment by focusing our research and development resources to leverage our core products in adjacent categories.  The recent launch of the BLUE WORKS line is a direct result of this strategy.", "Number three, developing our business through acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and strategic partners within our defined sandbox.  Number four, leveraging the trust the WD-40 brand has established with its wide user base to grow revenue and profits.  Our results continue to reflect our execution of these strategic initiatives so let\u2019s talk about the first quarter results and how the business is evolving.  ", "We are pleased with our first quarter results.  While sales were below Q1 of fiscal 2009 we expected them to be that way as the prior year quarter\u2019s sales benefited from the timing of global price increases implemented in Q1 and Q2 of our fiscal year 2009.  During the prior year period we saw many customers take advantage of lower prices prior to our price increase.  We then navigated through the uncertain economic times along with our customers and our stakeholders.", "Although there is still some uncertainty around us all, we are not about doom and gloom at WD-40 Company.  In the current quarter we continued to see improving economic stability in many markets and saw some of our core customers realize sales growth compared to major declines experienced during fiscal 2009.  We saw relative stability in foreign currency exchange rates and raw material costs, both of which significantly impact our results and gross margins.  ", "While changes in foreign currency change rates continue to impact our results, the magnitude was much lower than we had experienced during fiscal year of 2009.  In Q1 fiscal 2009 the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by $5.5 million compared to $1.8 million in the current quarter.  ", "On a constant currency basis, net sales in the current quarter would have decreased 5% instead of 7% and net income would have increased 27% instead of 22%.  Despite increases in oil based material costs in the current quarter versus Q4 of fiscal 2009 we managed our gross margin at 51.4% of sales, just shy of what we accomplished in the prior year fourth quarter.  Compared to a year ago, our gross margin in the current quarter was over 500 basis points higher than we experienced in Q1 of last fiscal year when oil based material costs peaked in our cost of goods.", "It\u2019s been a relatively good and stable quarter for us so let\u2019s dig in to the details of our results by product line and they are as follows.  Multipurpose maintenance products sales were down 8% compared to the first quarter fiscal 2009 yet 2% above our prior fourth quarter results.  Q1 was the largest sales quarter we had last year driven by customers\u2019 forward purchases prior to global price increases implemented in Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2009.  ", "The sales decreases in the first quarter were in the WD-40 brand as the 3-in-1 brand grew 7% in the period versus the prior period due to innovation and distribution in the Asia Pacific region.  The growth was driven primarily in China where we\u2019ve launched new formulations targeted to the automotive trade channel under the 3-in-1 pro brand line.  ", "By trade block, sales of our multipurpose maintenance products in Q1 were down 6% in the Americas, down 8% in Europe and down 7% in Asia Pacific.  Homecare and cleaning products were down 4% globally in the first quarter which includes the Spot Shot!, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, No Vac, 1001, X-14, LAVA and Solvol brands.  ", "By trade channels sales of our homecare and cleaning products in Q1 were down less than 1% in the Americas, 23% in Europe and up1% in Asia Pacific.  Spot Shot! Sales increased 30% in Q1 due to promotional activity.  Solvol which is exclusively sold in the Asia Pacific region increased 8% versus prior year period and these gains were offset by lower sales in other homecare and cleaning brands.  ", "The 1001 brand which is exclusively sold in Europe declined by 23% due to the timing of promotional activities and the unfavorable impact in changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Sales of other brands were impacted by decreased distribution and the effect of competitive factors.  Period versus period automatic toilet bowl cleaners under the 2000 Flushes and X-14 brands combined declined [70%] and X-14 hard surface cleaners declined 37%, Carpet Fresh 8% and LAVA 17%.  ", "Now, looking at our results by segment, as I mentioned earlier sales in our current quarter are lower compared to last fiscal year primarily due to prices increases implemented in Q1 and Q2 of the fiscal year of 2009.  Sales in all three segments which include the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific were impacted by this period-over-period.  There were also impacts from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Europe which negatively impacted global net sales by $1.8 million.", "Sales in the Americas decreased to $43.7 million in Q1 down $1.8 million or 4% versus Q1 last fiscal year.   In the US the sales decreased by 3% driven by lower sales of multipurpose maintenance products.  Homecare and cleaning product sales in the Americas were up 1% driven by Spot Shot! which benefited from a comprehensive consumer targeted campaign surrounding the successful film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  The campaign included commercial advertising in movie theaters, a robust online program and discounts with free purchases of promotions.  It also included print ad in magazines and special in store displays.  The brand also received excellent press coverage in the red carpet premier and through special regional screenings which included a program with Feeding America.  ", "Sales in Latin America decreased by 5%, most of which was in the WD-40 brand.  Sales in Canada decreased by 13% versus Q1 of last fiscal year with a negligible impact from changes in foreign currency rates versus the prior period.  Although the sales for Latin America and Canada were lower in Q1 of fiscal 2009, these markets showed a recovery with growth of 36% and 44% respectively versus the prior fourth quarter of last year.", "We\u2019re also pleased to report that we began shipping our new BLUE WORKS product line as expected in early December and we\u2019ll start to see modest sales results in the second quarter as we begin to build distribution.  You\u2019ll not find this BLUE WORKS new line in your local hardware store as BLUE WORKS is aimed at industrial customers in the repair, maintenance and overhaul segments of the market.  We are encouraged by the feedback and the early acceptance we have received regarding BLUE WORKS which carries for the first time the WD-40 Company DNA.", "We continue to have global expansion efforts in Europe which accounted for 35% of global sales in Q1.  Sales in Europe decreased to $27.2 million down $2.9 million or 10% versus Q1 of last fiscal year.  Most of these decreases were due to the changes in foreign exchange rates period versus period.  Europe sales on a constant sales basis would have been $29.4 million down $.7 million or 2% for the period.  ", "We sell in to Europe through a combination of direct operations in certain countries as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in other countries.  We have direct sales force operations in the UK, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and in the markets we term the German region which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands.  Overall sales in these direct markets were down 5% in Q1 versus the prior year quarter.  ", "The direct markets which experienced Q1 sales growth in US dollars were France, Spain and Italy which grew 19%, 30% and 51% respectively.  The sales growth in Italy and the Spanish region was primarily due to improved market conditions and new distribution which sales growth in France was driven by continued growth of the WD-40 Smart Straw and the 3-in-1 Pro product lines.  These gains were offset by decreases in the UK and German markets which in US dollars decreased 26% and 18% respectively.  ", "The sales declines in these markets were due to the timing of promotional activity during Q1 compared to the same quarter last year.  Promotional activity was higher during the first quarter of the prior fiscal year in advance of the price increases implemented in that quarter.  We sell through exclusive independent marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe and in the Middle East and Africa and virtually all sales in this area consisted of the WD-40 brand.  ", "These distributor markets combined accounted for approximately 38% of our total European segment sales and decreased 17% in Q1 versus the same period last year.  As with many other markets, sales in the first quarter of 2009 were high in advance of the price increases implemented during that quarter.  Asia Pacific which is a global strategic growth market for us accounted for approximately 9% of sales in Q1.  Asia Pacific sales decreased to $6.8 million or down $1.1 million or 14% in Q1 versus the same period last year.", "Sales in Australia increased by 11% while sales in the Asia distributor markets and China declined by 22% and 38% respectively.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period versus period had favorable impact on sales.  In constant currency, Asia Pacific sales in the current year would have decreased $1.4 million or 18%.  The 11% sales increase in Australia in Q1 was due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  On a constant currency basis, sales would have decreased slightly during the period primarily due to merchandising changes within some key customers.  ", "China and many of the markets throughout the Asian region experienced strong sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 followed by declining sales throughout the remainder of the fiscal year due to the negative impact of the general economic conditions.  Although these markets appear to be improving, sales growth in the current period has been slow.  In addition, continuing economic challenges and competitive factors have negatively impacted sales in certain markets in the Asian region. ", "Despite these challenges, China continues to be a long term growth market for us.  It\u2019s not unusual to see these bumpy sales trends as we build new markets.  There are a lot of squeaks in China and many end users find WD-40 to get their jobs done for the first time every day and they\u2019ll continue to do that for many years to come.  That\u2019s it for the sales update and now over to Jay Rembolt who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "In addition to the information that is presented in this call, we suggest that you review our 10Q that will be filed today.  As Gary has covered sales in detail, I will continue with the rest of the financials.  Gross margin was 51.4% of sales in the first quarter compared to 46.3% of sales in the prior year quarter.  The 510 basis point increase was primarily attributable to prior year price increases, lower discounts and shifts in major input costs as well as sourcing changes and product conversions.  ", "Price increases implemented in Q1 and Q2 of fiscal \u201909 added approximately 160 basis points to our gross margin percentage in the first quarter.  The price increases were primarily across our multipurpose maintenance products although some price increases were also implemented on our homecare and cleaning products in Europe.  Lower promotional and other discounts positively impacted gross margin by 90 basis points.  Certain of our advertising and promotional costs such as customer rebates, display allowances, slotting, coupon redemptions are treated as a reduction in sales.  Period versus period, a lower percentage of our sales were subject to these promotional allowances this year in our Q1.  ", "This quarter saw lower costs for petroleum based products, mostly offset by higher costs for aerosol cans.  Although the cost of petroleum based materials has been on the rise, our costs continue to be much lower than we had experienced in the first quarter of 2009.  The impact of these lower costs increased our gross margin by 390 basis points.  This benefit was offset by the dramatic increase in the cost of our aerosol cans that took effect in the second quarter of fiscal \u201909.", "The higher cost for aerosol cans had a negative impact on our gross margin and impacted by 330 basis points.  Other items that favorably impacted our cost of goods sold included sourcing changes and product conversions.  The sourcing changes and product conversions positively impacted gross margin by 130 basis points.  Cost of goods sold improvements stemmed from new lower cost formulations associated with product conversions, investments in equipment to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products and lower cost manufacturers.", "Our gross margin was also positively impacted as we began manufacturing our WD-40 Smart Straw in Europe.  Previously the Smart Straw was exclusively manufactured in the US and sold in to our international markets.  When the international local currencies declined in value against the dollar in Q1 of fiscal 2009 the cost of the Smart Straw effectively increased negatively impacting our gross margin.", "To mitigate this impact and to reduce freight costs we initiated Smart Straw manufacturing in Europe during the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201909 and as a result of this change our gross margin improved by 50 basis points in the current fiscal year versus the prior year.  Sales mix and other miscellaneous impacts combined positively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points. ", "This completes the gross margin discussion and we\u2019ll look on to operating expenses beginning with our selling, general and administrative expenses.  Our SG&A expense in Q1 was $19.8 million versus $21.1 million in the prior quarter.  As a percentage, SG&A increased slightly to 25.5% of sales.  Favorable impacts to SG&A expense include freight costs which decreased $.7 million due to lower fuel costs, increased shipping efficiencies and lower sales.  Lower professional service costs which decreased $.5 million primarily due to lower legal fees in the quarter.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to Q1 of last year decreased the expense by $.4 million and lower miscellaneous expense of $.5 million which would include things like bad debt expense, broker and sales commissions and a few others.  These favorable impacts were offset by higher employee related costs which increased $.7 million primarily due to compensation increases and higher staffing levels.  ", "Our advertising and sales promotion expense in Q1 was $5.2 million versus $5.4 million in the prior year quarter and slightly increased as a percentage of sales from 6.5% to 6.7%.  The actual level of investments remains fairly constant but the expense in dollars is lower due to the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  ", "Our amortization of intangible assets was $.2 million compared to $.1 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter includes amortization related to the Carpet Fresh and the [inaudible] trade names which were changed to definite life intangible assets at August 31, 2009.  Both periods include $.1 million of amortization related to the customer lists acquired in the 1001 acquisition completed in fiscal year 2004.  ", "Operating income in Q1 was $14.7 million compared to $12.1 million in the prior year quarter.  Net interest expense in Q1 was $.5 million, up slightly from the same period last year.  Our other income decreased by $.1 million primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange gains versus the prior year quarter.  The provision for income taxes in Q1 was 34.4%, a decrease from the 35.2% in the prior year quarter.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of income expected from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the US.", "The net income in Q1 was $9.4 million an increase of 22.5% from the $7.7 million in the prior year quarter.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net income of $.3 million.  Q1 fiscal \u201910 results on a constant currency basis would have produced net income of $9.7 million.  On a diluted per share basis earnings were $0.56 in Q1 compared to $0.46 in the prior year quarter.  Diluted shares outstanding on similar to the prior year period at 16.7 million shares.", "Regarding the dividend, on December 8th the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on January 29, 2010 to the shareholders of record on January 8, 2010.  Based on today\u2019s closing price of $32.50 the annual dividend yield would be 3.1%.  ", "About our balance sheet at November 30th, cash and cash equivalents were $48.9 million up from $46 million at the end of \u201909.  Cash provided by operations was $16.3 million.  Issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options provided additional cash of $.9 million and we also got a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates on cash which had an impact of $.8 million.  ", "These cash inflows were partially offset by: one, our annual $10.7 million principal payment; two, dividends paid of $4.1 million; and, approximately $.3 million used for capital expenditures during the period.  We continue to delever our company with our annual October $10.7 million principal payment.  As of November 30th our outstanding balance on our original $75 million term loan was $21.4 million.  Final payment will be due in October of 2011.  ", "The company\u2019s financial condition and liquidity continue to remain strong.  Our strong balance sheet helped us to weather the recent global liquidity crisis and as we look forward it will also serve us well in executing on our core strategic initiatives.  We believe that our existing cash, the liquidity available from our credit facilities and our anticipated cash flows from operation will be sufficient to meet the projected operating capital requirements of our business.  This would include supporting our core strategic initiatives of acquisitions, investing in new direct markets for global expansion and supporting new product introductions.", "In light of our strong cash position and goal to provide long term return to shareholders, the company\u2019s board of directors authorized an open ended share buyback plan.  Under the plan approved on December 8, 2009, the company may acquire up to $15 million of the company\u2019s outstanding shares during 2010.  The authority will expire on December 8, 2010.", "That completes the financial overview and again, more information will be available in the 10Q which is filed today.  Now back to you Gary.", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Now, let\u2019s discuss our outlook and guidance on the balance of fiscal 2010.  We continue to be cautiously optimistic as how we see economic conditions improve.  While we see increased momentum, we also recognize there is still a level of uncertainty in the marketplace.  Given these conditions and that we\u2019re only a few months in to our fiscal year, we are maintaining the guidance we shared with you last quarter.  The following fiscal year 2010 guidance does not include any acquisition activity and assumes foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels.", "Having said this, we continue our search for business opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships that fit our stated criteria.  We also continue to dedicate time, talent and treasure to understand and leverage the trust of the WD-40 brand and we will share any of these new developments with you as they evolve.  So, for fiscal year 2010 we expect our net sales results to be in the range of $298 to $380 million.  That will be a growth of between 2% and 9% in sales versus 2009.  ", "We expect our global advertising promotional investment to be in the range of 6.5% and 8% of net sales and we expect the net income to be in the range of $30.2 to $32.8 million which would achieve an EPS of between $1.80 and $1.95 assuming that there are 16 million shares outstanding.  Thank you for joining us today, we would be pleased to open the conference call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities.", "Analyst for Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities", "I had a question here about raw materials and the trends that you might be seeing both in petroleum as we get in to 2010 here and steel costs?", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Well, we\u2019ve seen that the petroleum based products rise a little bit as of late.  I think if we look forward the rates that we currently see are probably what we\u2019re going to experience on average throughout the end of our fiscal year.  With respect to our tin plate pricing, we are in our annual pricing negotiations and have yet to determine if we\u2019re going to receive any sort of price decreases.", "Analyst for Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities", "You normally have some seasonality as you get in to your second fiscal quarter, is that something we might expect this year?", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Well, I think seasonality went out with the uncertainty that we treaded through last year.  But, having said that I think if you consider our guidance, what we\u2019re looking at is the first quarter this year was up against a fairly solid first quarter of last year and now we\u2019re going up against two relatively soft quarters in two and three and that should help us obtain our guidance which was sales growth through the full year.  ", "So there is no doubt that the two toughest quarters last year were the second and third quarter for everybody.  We don\u2019t see them obviously being as tough this year and we\u2019ve reflected that in the sales guidance we\u2019ve given and hence why there\u2019s quite a delta in that guidance because we want to make sure we\u2019re not being overly optimistic in what may happen.  But, that\u2019s kind of how we see it.", "Analyst for Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities", "Lastly currency, is there expectation baked in to that sales growth number?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "The currency impact is based on the currencies that we see as of today or recent currency kind of projecting forward so our currency outlook is in some ways blind.  We are just projecting based on current currencies.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Given the cost cuts you instituted last year and the issues we went through last year, it looks like now you have some good potential leverage in your business model which you can obviously harness by driving volume.  So, broadly speaking can you just speak to the idea of how you view the opportunities you have to drive volume over the next 12 months or so?", "Gary O. Ridge ", "I\u2019m not quite sure we did any cost cutting Alan.  Maybe you are referring to the enhancement of our gross margin which has been a strategic driver of ours for four or five years.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Yes, exactly.", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Our sales growth opportunities are really aligned with our strategic drivers.  The first one is our continued global expansion which will come from our European and Asia markets.  Secondly the expansion of our activity around our multipurpose maintenance products which will include the strengthening of the WD-40 brand\u2019s position in the US and in other markets and then development of the 3-in-1 Pro line and then also to a lesser extent because it\u2019s quite an unknown yet is the BLUE WORKS line. ", "They are the major drivers. The other area is the stabilization if you will of our homecare and cleaning products where we are very encouraged with the 30% increase in our Spot Shot! brand in the first quarter.  And, as you know we made the decision that we would place our bet on the big winners when we deemphasized the new development activity particularly around X-14 and Carpet Fresh and rediverted that time, talent and treasurer in to product development activities around our multipurpose maintenance products around the world and then on a promotional basis on the Spot Shot! and to a lesser extend 2000 Flushes business.", "So global expansion, expansion of our multipurpose maintenance products area, stabilization of our homecare cleaning products and hopefully, although none of it is really baked in as we continue our development activities revenue that will come from our other strategic drivers which are really leveraging the trust that we\u2019ve established with the end user of the WD-40 brand.  There\u2019s a lot of work going on there.  Then finally, just ventures, acquisitions and partnerships that we may enter in to that either leverage our global position or some other channel strength that we may have.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "I\u2019m also trying to get an idea of the extent to which the last minute buying that you experienced in the first quarter of last year impact your comparables?  I know you increased your prices on various WD-40 products in the first and second quarter so when I look back to the first quarter of fiscal \u201909 do you have a rough level that you could share with us of the impact that had either on a dollar basis or on a percent growth basis?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "We haven\u2019t quantified that.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Is it likely to be material?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "No, it wouldn\u2019t not but it\u2019s enough in comparison period-on-period to have us come up a little shy this period.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Then last question, what tax rate assumptions are embedded in your fiscal year guidance and is there any significant BLUE WORKS revenue in that as well?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "Well, we haven\u2019t shared our tax rate in our guidance, we typically share just the various items that we\u2019ve included in our guidance.  With respect to BLUE WORKS we see that as a very slow build.  I\u2019ll let Gary share a little bit more about how we think about the BLUE WORKS.", "Gary O. Ridge ", "BLUE WORKS is a brand that as I shared in my commentary is one that you won\u2019t find in your local hardware store.  So, the sell in isn\u2019t about loading in to shelves, the sell in is about making the end users aware and making it easier for them to buy and the end users are repair maintenance and overhaul professionals in factories and that just takes a little longer.  So, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the BLUE WORKS program over time but there is certainly no significant ramp up of BLUE WORKS in this year\u2019s guidance.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC.", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC", "Gary, you mentioned in your commentary in revenues in China that you saw additional competition?", "Gary O. Ridge ", "No.  If I did I didn\u2019t mean that.  The issues in China are not competitive from any particular competitive source.  They are bumpy as China reduced manufacturing particularly for export as the world economies turned down we backed off a little bit but we\u2019re very, very bullish about China in to the future.  It\u2019s not unusual for us to see some bumpy sales trends as we start to build markets.   But we\u2019re no less confident about China today, it\u2019s just taking a little time and certainly the economic conditions that surrounded it were not in our favor but we\u2019re very comfortable about taking our time to do China right.", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC", "On BLUE WORKS, it\u2019s a given that it\u2019s going to be a slow ramp.  Now, you mentioned having to increase the awareness of the product with the repair maintenance and overhaul channel.  What specifically do you do and is it a hit on resources to develop those kinds of campaigns?", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Good question, thanks for asking it.  Basically what has happened is part of the strategic or tactical execution with BLUE WORKS is us engaging across the United States a team of manufacturer representatives if you will that specialize in calling on the decision makers in repair, maintenance and overhaul facilities.  So these would be people who represent products to plant managers in major manufacturing operations across the US.", "These people have been for the last nine months grilled and trained.  In fact, they all now have what we call masters in BLUE WORKS degrees which is a comprehensive training program we did with them that they have to pass.  Their job is to carry the BLUE WORKS message with samples of the product to the end users.  So, they started doing that early in December, late November and before that it was all collateral based so now they\u2019re taking the product to end users, putting it in to factories, having the end users sample the product so that\u2019s stage one.", "We have identified the key target customers we want across the United States to do that.  There are three rep organizations across the US that are doing this for us and then those companies then source product from who you would normally call our distributors.  So, our sales people are selling to the traditional distributors.  Those sales rep organizations are paid for that on a commission basis for sales so the costs are variable in relation to the success of their efforts.", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC", "Jay, could we go back to the cost of raw materials?  The tin plate pricing is fixed on an annual basis, is that right?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "Yes, it has been?", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC", "Has it been fixed through this fiscal year?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "It hasn\u2019t been finalized.", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC", "With steel prices on the rise, you\u2019re anticipating that it would at least hold its own this year?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "That\u2019s certainly our preliminary expectation at this time.  We are expecting it not to increase.", "Operator", "", "At this time there are no further questions.  I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gary O. Ridge ", "Thank you very much for joining us this afternoon.  We appreciate your interest.  As Jay said, the 10Q is filed today so you have all the reading you want.  We wish you a good 90 days and we\u2019ll talk to you again after the end of the next quarter.  Thanks very much.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company\u2019s outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results.

Our third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, July 2, 2008 at 2:00 pm. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Garry Ridge.", "Garry Ridge", "", "Good day, thanks Maria and thank you for joining us today on our conference call. The company\u2019s diversification strategy across borders and trade channels continues to benefit global sales and profits. In the second quarter, 66% of WD-40 brand sales and 57% of our total sales were outside the United States, proving we are truly a global company. Our international segments grew over 22% in total versus the second quarter last year, essentially offsetting the challenges we are seeing in the US market. Today we reported net sales of $78.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of $400,000 or half of a percent versus last year. ", "Year to date net sales are $158.1 million, an increase of 4.5% over the same period last year. Net income for the second quarter was $8.7 million, down 3.1% compared to the second quarter last year. Year to date net income is $14.9 million, up 1.8% from the same period last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51 compared to $0.52 last year and year to date earnings per share are $0.87, up from $0.85 last year. Taking a look at our performance by product segment, in the lubricants segment, sales in Q2 were $59.3 million, up 4.5% over the same quarter last year and year to date are $116.6 million, tracking at 10.4% above the year to date last year. ", "Hand cleaners came in at $1.2 million, they were off 700 basis points, year to date they are $2.9 million, off 300 basis points and household products were $18.4 million, down 13.7% in the same quarter for last year and $38.6 million year to date, off 9.7%. Lubricant sales were up globally in the second quarter, with both driven by the European and Asian Pacific trading blocks. Our core lubricant business continues to be a growth opportunity with great geographic expansion and the addition of WD-40 smart straw. As previously announced, we converted many of our can sizes exclusively to the smart straw format in the United States in just recently which was in late March of this year. ", "Household products were down 14% globally in Q2 versus the second quarter last year, driven by declines in the US market. US household product sales were down 20% in the second quarter and down 14% year to date, the result of several factors including lost distribution, timing of promotions and customer purchasing patterns. I am pleased however to see sales growth in our household products in Asia Pacific and Europe business segments which grew 42% and 6% respectively in Q2 versus the second quarter last year. ", "The increases were driven by growth of the 1001 brand in Europe and No Vac sales in Australia. Heavy duty hand cleaners continued to be a small stable and profitable line of our business at our company. Hand cleaners represented 2% of global sales this quarter and sales in Q2 were essentially equal to the same period last year. We switched to our regions, in the Americas trading block, sales for Q2 were $41.9 million, up 14.4% and year to date are $85.4 million, off 9.2%. ", "Last year the Americas region accounted for 62% of global company sales while still the company\u2019s largest segment, the Americas region shifted to 53% of total sales in the current quarter. This shift is due to the growing Asia Pacific and European markets as well as the challenges and weakening market to conditions in the US. Breaking the Americas block into smaller regions, in the US, sales were down 20% and are down 13.6% year to date. ", "US sales were down 20% in Q2 versus the second quarter last year driven by declines in both the WD-40 brand and household products. The decrease in the WD-40 sales was the result of the timing of promotional activities as well as key customers reducing inventory levels and in store promotional activity in advance of the smart straw conversion and also in response of the slowing US economy. The decline in household products was driven by decreased or lost distribution, the carpet and toilet bowl cleaning segments continued to sustain the declining shelf space and category shifts, while hard surface cleaners continue to be a highly competitive category. ", "In addition to these pressures, the US lost the distribution in Q2 with some customers because of out of stocks that were related to the Q1 manufacturing disruption. The company is working to offset these declines in household products through innovation that capitalize on category trends as well as new packaging and promotional offerings. And as a result, in the carpet care segment, we are introducing an environmentally friendly stain remover. The company is introducing a non aerosol green and pet focused spot shot products that are non-toxic and bio-degradable. ", "The pet product is already in distribution and the other items will be in distribution during Q3. In Latin America, our Latin American business which is primarily based in lubricants, WD-40 and 3-in-1 brand were up 22% in the quarter, and primarily due to increased distribution and development of the business in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Year to date Latin America was up 23%. In Canada, we sell lubricants, hand cleaners and household products, Canada sales were up 22% in Q2 due to increased promotional activity in the WD-40 brand versus the prior fiscal year and second quarter. ", "We now will go across the pond to Europe. Our European business includes lubricants and household products and sales in Q2 were $29.8 million, up 22.2% for the quarter. Year to date they\u2019re running at $58.2 million, up 25.8% year to date. The European region generated sales increases versus last year in all of its operating segments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to Q2 last fiscal year positively impacted current sales in the region by approximately $600,000 or 2%. ", "In our European direct markets, where we have sales forces, those being UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany Portugal, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands, sales were up 17.7% in the quarter and year to date are running at an increase of 20.6%. Specifically, by country in the quarter, the UK is up 9%, we\u2019re up 28% in France, 25% in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands, 23% in Spain and Portugal and 21% in Italy. Sales from these countries accounted for 69% of the total European sales in the current fiscal quarter, down from 72% in Q2 of the last fiscal year. ", "Our investment in our direct operations in Europe continues to be validated by the consistent growth of our business. We in the distributor markets of Europe, we sell through independent local distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe and in the Middle East and Africa. All of the European distributor markets combined grew 34% over the second quarter last year. The distributor market grew to account to about 31% of our total European segment in Q2, up from 28% in the same period last year. ", "Turning to the Asia Pacific block, Asia Pacific sales are approximately 9% of our total company sales compared to 8% of the total sales in the second quarter of last year. Sales in that area were $7.3 million in the quarter, up 20.9% and year to date are running at $14.5 million, up 32.3%. Asia Pacific benefited from increased lubricant sales in both Asia and Australia as well as increased No Vac and Solvol sales in the Australian market. Changes in foreign currency, exchange rates compared to the same period last year positively impacted current sales by approximately $400,000 or 6%. ", "Breaking the region into two, looking at Asia alone, the Asian sales were up 17.4% for the quarter and up 30.5% year to date. This region represents long time growth potential for the company. While the company has historically sold to Asia through third party marketing distributors to help accelerate the growth in the region, the company began direct operations in China in 2007. We are pleased that our sales in China grew by 68% in Q2 over the second quarter of last year. ", "The balance of the Asia distributor markets grew 5.3% for the second quarter of last year. Sales across the region were up including India, Indonesia, Japan and Hong Kong. The increased sales were the result of both increased promotional activity as well as continued growth in awareness, penetration and usage of the WD-40 brand. Strong sales in China and Asia distributor markets led Asia total sales to a 17% increase. In Australia, sales were up 28% in Q2 and are running at a 35.5% year to date, primarily due to the sales growth of lubricants and No Vac. ", "Sales of WD-40 are benefited from account specific promotional activity with key accounts as well as the continued broad distribution across many trade channels. The No Vac product continued to gain market share in the Australian growing industry of aerosol rug and room deodorizers. That\u2019s it for the sales update, now over to Mike Irwin who will continue to review the financials.", "Michael Irwin", "", "Thanks Garry. In addition to the information presented on this call we suggest that you review our 10K that will be filed today. As Garry\u2019s covered the sales in detail we\u2019ll continue with the rest of the financials. In regards to our second quarter results, gross profit was 48.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 49.2% of sales in Q2 last year. The 0.9% decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to increases in costs of products stemming from escalating component and raw material costs including aerosol cans and petroleum based products. ", "To combat the rising costs, the company has implemented price increases on certain products worldwide. These price increases added approximately 0.9% to the gross margin percentage in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to Q2 of 2007. In addition to price increases, shifts in product mix in Europe helped to mitigate the rise in cost during the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Another factor in the decreasing gross margin percentage was the increase in advertising and promotional discounts which negatively impacted gross margin by 0.3%. ", "Certain A&P costs such as coupons, slotting and customer rebates are treated as a reduction in sales. The timings of these promotional activities as well as shifts in product mix may influence fluctuations in gross margin percentage from period to period. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased 3.1% to $20.3 million. The increase in SG&A stems in part from higher employee related costs of $0.4 million for salary increases, benefits and additional staffing to support China operations as well as $0.2 million for stock options expense. ", "Higher research and development costs of $0.3 million due to the timing of new product development activity, higher costs for professional services of $0.2 million primarily as the result of increased legal costs and $0.3 million of the SG&A expense increase was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by $0.8 million decrease in freight costs and other miscellaneous expenses, such as commissions and investor relations costs. The higher costs though lowered our operating leverage as SG&A expense increased to 25.8% of sales in the second quarter compared to 24.9% in the same period last year. Advertising sales promotion expenses decreased to $4.2 million in the second quarter from $5.1 million in Q2 last year. And as a percent of sales, decreased to 5.4% from 6.4% in Q2 last year. ", "In the prior fiscal year second quarter the company invested in consumer broadcast advertising and print media in the US to support advertising of the Spot Shot brand which wasn\u2019t repeated. The costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as a reduction in sales while others remain in advertising and sales promotion expenses. In the second quarter, total promotional costs recorded as reductions in sales, was actually two sales were $3.9 million in fiscal 2008 versus $3.4 million in fiscal 2007, therefore the company\u2019s total investment in advertising and sales promotion activity totaled $8.1 million in Q2 versus $8.5 million last year. ", "Operating income for the quarter was $13.4 million compared to $14.1 million in Q2 last year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.4 million, down from $0.6 million in Q2 last year, reflecting the continued reduction in debt as we made our annual $10.7 million principle payment in October 2007. Other income was $229,000 in Q2 compared to other expense of $94,000 in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. The increase of $323,000 was due to foreign currency exchange gains in the current fiscal second quarter compared to foreign currency exchange losses in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. ", "The provision for income taxes was 34.6%, for the current quarter, an increase from 33.2% in Q2 last year. The increase in rate is primarily due to onetime tax benefits in Q2 last year, including favorable rulings on foreign tax matters, the renewed Federal research and experimentation credit and the tax benefit of municipal bond interest. The increase in tax rate in the current year quarter was partially offset by decreases in foreign tax rates and increased benefits related to qualified production activities. ", "Net income in the quarter was $8.7 million, down 3.1% from Q2 last year and on a diluted per share basis, earnings were $0.51 compared to $0.52 in Q2 last year. Diluted shares outstanding have decreased to 17 million shares compared to 17.2 million for the prior year quarter. Now moving on to the first half results, gross profit was 47.8% of sales compared to 48.6% for the same half last year. The 0.8% decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to increases in costs of products stemming from higher component and raw material costs. To combat these costs again, the company has implemented price increases. ", "These price increases added approximately 0.8% points to the gross margin percentage in the first half of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. In addition to price increases, the shifts in product mix period versus period in Europe helped to mitigate the cost. The company continues to address the rising costs through innovation and cost containment strategies. Another factor in the decrease in gross margin percentage was the increase in A&P or advertising promotional and other discounts which negatively impacted the first half gross margin by 0.2%. ", "Moving on to selling, general and administrative expenses for the first six months, increased 7.2% to $41.6 million and the increase in SG&A stems in part from higher employee related costs of $0.9 million for salary increases, benefits and additional staffing to support China as well as $0.3 million for stock options expense, higher costs for professional services of $0.4 million, primarily as a result of increased legal cost and higher miscellaneous expenses of $0.3 million which included increased R&D costs and increased meeting and investor relations costs. ", "The $0.9 million of the SG&A expense increase was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The higher costs lowered our operating leverage as SG&A expense increased to 26.3% of sales in the first half compared 25.6% in the same period last year. Advertising and promotion expenses increased slightly to $10.9 million in the first six months from $10.7 million in the first half last year. And as a percent of sales, A&P expense decreased to 6.9% of sales from 7.1% in the half year. ", "Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, advertising promotion expenses were essentially flat. Investment in global advertising promotion expense for 2008 is expected to be in the range of 6.5-8.5% of sales for the year. Operating income for the first six months was $22.9 million compared to $23.7 million in the same period last year. Net interest expense for the year to date period was $0.8 million compared to $1.3 million during the first six months of 2007. ", "And again we have made our annual principle payment in October with another one due in October 2008. Other income was $541,000 during the first six months compared to other expense of $185,000 in the prior fiscal year period. The increase of $726,000 was due to foreign exchange gains in the current fiscal year period compared to foreign currency exchange losses in the prior year period. The provision for income taxes was 34.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2008, nearly flat to the 34.2% rate we experienced in the first half last year. ", "The slight decrease in tax rate was primarily due to increased benefits related to qualified production activities and a decrease in foreign tax rates which were partially offset by onetime benefits in the prior fiscal year from favorable rulings on foreign tax matters. Net income in the first six months was $14.9 million, up 1.8% from the first half of the prior year and on a dilutive per share basis, EPS was $0.87 compared to $0.85 last year. Diluted shares outstanding decreased to $17 million for the first half compared to $17.3 million for the half last year. ", "And regarding the dividend, on March 25th the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 a share, equal to the previous year\u2019s dividend and that\u2019s payable on April 30th, 2008 to shareholders of record on April 16th. Based on today\u2019s closing price of $33.16, the annualized dividend yield will be 3%. Moving on to the balance sheet at February 29th, 2008, cash and equivalents were $23.4 million, down from $61.1 million at the end of the fiscal year. Year to date cash uses included $10.7 million for the principle payment on debt, $8.5 million for dividend payments and $17.7 million for share repurchases. ", "Accounts receivable increased to $52.9 million, up $5.7 million from the end of last year as a result of the timing of sales. Inventory increased to approximately $17 million, up by $3.8 million versus the end of year level. The increase in inventory was due to the buildup of inventory for new product introductions in the US, as well as the acquisition of inventory from VML which is the contract manufacturer and warehouse distributor for the company. Certain finished goods were owned in warehouse by VML under the company\u2019s historical contract to manufacture model as the company transitions to direct management of these finished goods of acquired inventory from VML to supply its distribution centers. ", "The purchase of VML manufactured goods will continue going forward. A word about auction rate securities. Periodically the company has invested in an interest bearing short term investments consisting of investment grade auction rate securities. Although these investments have states maturities 13 months to 30 years, they\u2019re designed to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets interest rates at pre-determined periods ranging from 7 to 35 days. This reset mechanisms is intended to allow existing investors to continue to own their respective interest in the auction rate security or to gain immediate liquidity by selling their interest at par. ", "Our practice had been to liquidate short term investments near the end of each fiscal quarter. However at the end of the second quarter we had $6.1 million of auction rate securities with underlying tax exempt municipal bonds with stated maturities of 26 to 27 years. These bonds are insured and have triple A ratings. The underlying issuer of these bonds have credit rates of at least double A minus. As a result of the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets, in February and March of 2008, auctions for auction rate securities held by the company failed. ", "The auction rate securities continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the underlying security, however liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these investments develop. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity related to auction rate securities will have an impact on our ability to fund operations. Current liabilities were $48.5 million, down from $53.9 million at August 31st, 2007. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $4.7 million due to the timing of payments. Accrued payroll and related expenses were down $3 million, primarily due to decreased bonus accrual. ", "And on March 27th 2007, the Board of Directors approved a share buyback plan and under the plan which was in effect for up to 12 months the company was authorized to acquire $35 million of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the first six months of fiscal 2008, the company completed the repurchase program by acquiring 1,028,800 shares at a total cost of $35 million. That\u2019s the financial update; again more information is available on the 10Q to be filed today. Thanks very much and we\u2019ll turn it to Garry Ridge.", "Garry Ridge", "", "Thanks Mike. While we are poised to weather the deteriorating economic conditions in the US with our growing international operations, we are revising our fiscal year guidance to reflect the challenges in the US market and global pressure on cost of goods. Here\u2019s a recap of our revised guidance for fiscal 2008. We now expect sales to grow by between 4% to 8% to $320 million to $332 million driven by continued geographic expansion, market penetration and new products. ", "We expect our advertising and promotional investments to range between 6.5% to 8.5% of sales and we expect net income of between $30.3 million and $31.9 million which would achieve an earnings per share of between $1.80 to $1.90 assuming shares outstanding of 16.8 million. Our guidance does not include any acquisition. We will continue to focus on growing sales and improving gross margins from both innovation activities and cost reduction initiatives. We\u2019ll also continue to look for the right acquisition of well known niche brands that can be entirely integrated into our business. To sum up, we really have the tale of two businesses right now. ", "We\u2019ve got the challenges in the US market offset by continued growth in nearly every other market around the world. The US market challenges are as we see them as follows, continued pressure in household products by direct competition and competition of shelf space as we\u2019ve seen for several years. WD-40 sales affected thus far as major customers scale back purchases and promotional activity in anticipation of the conversion to WD-40 smart straw which was done and executed on time in March and early April. ", "With both of these factors amplified by customer response to the ailing US economy. Cost of goods remains a concern to us. Today oil hit $112 a barrel. But we\u2019re not sitting still, we\u2019re introducing a non-toxic bio-degradable carpet stain removers from the spot shot brand and we also expect the US smart straw conversion to help our sales and gross margin dollars as the unit price is approximately 30% higher than the comparable size of the WD-40 can. In addition, we\u2019re taking price increases in several countries around the world. Outside the US, we continue to sustain growth rates. ", "Our European business has grown sales at a compounded annual growth rate of 19.9% from 2002 through to 2007 and is up 25.8% through the first half of fiscal year 08. Our Asia Pacific sales are up 32.3% through the first six months of fiscal year 08. At the core we sell simple staple maintenance products, we\u2019re in the squeak, smell and dirt business and as far as I can tell, the needs continue to happen regardless of the economic climate. Thanks for joining us today and that\u2019s the way it was for Q2 2008. We\u2019d be pleased to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to Jeff Zekauskas at J.P. Morgan.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Good afternoon, this is Ben Richardson sitting in for Jeff Zekauskas. Looking at your gross margin we saw a decline year over year of about 90 basis points. And can you talk a little about what you\u2019re experiencing, whether it\u2019s in aerosols, cans or in on the petroleum end.", "Michael Irwin", "", "Well I mean a couple things to keep in mind; I just want to put this in perspective. In the case of just using a can of WD-40 as an example, the majority of the cost of the WD-40 can finished product is not related to the cost of petroleum because the biggest chunk of it is related to packaging. But as Garry mentioned earlier, oil hitting $112 barrel today, we\u2019ve seen higher costs of the component ingredients that go into those products, higher petroleum costs also affect us in the plastic parts like the straws and the spray nozzles and that sort of thing and affect us in plastic bottles in which we sell many of our household cleaning products. ", "We\u2019ve seen a continued rise in the cost of aerosol cans which I think have gone up by more than 75% over the past five years. That too is a major factor to us. And so we\u2019ve been in this cycle of spiraling upward of costs across many of our cost lines on our underlying cost of goods. So it is a concern to us. We don\u2019t sit around and feel like we\u2019re waiting on costs to go down and so what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken a three pronged approach to helping improve our gross margin which is a strong priority to us. Number one we\u2019ve taken price increases where we can and where it makes sense. ", "We are a company though that believes that our job is to deliver above expectation performance at extremely good value to end users and so we\u2019re mindful of what our challenge is and so we try to maintain efficiency in our operation. But we have taken price increases and we\u2019ve taken price increases I believe for every single one of the past four fiscal years including the current one and that\u2019s a consideration. Number two, we want to use innovation as a way to improve our gross margin as Garry mentioned. ", "We have been in the implementation phase of the transition of WD-40 in the regular spray nozzle cans to the smart straw which is a way of delivering added value to end users and it just so happens that that added value also comes in the way of a higher price. So much like the toothbrushes which are of higher value today but also more expensive, WD-40 is following that step in the US. And so we\u2019re using innovation for things like that to help address the margin. And then the third area is that we continue to look at our supply chain and ways to help improve our efficiency, improve our gross margin while at the same time delivering better service to our customers.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Alright. And is it possible for you to quantify all of the, you know the gross margin you expect to recover through the introduction of smart straw in the US?", "Michael Irwin", "", "No it\u2019s not and we don\u2019t give forecast on gross margin anyway.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, alright. In that case I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, next we\u2019ll go to Alan Robinson at RBC.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Hi, good afternoon. You mentioned price increases during the quarter, improved gross margins by I think 90 basis points. To what extent was that impacted by smart straw or is that really a third quarter issue?", "Michael Irwin", "", "Smart straw is a third quarter issue as Garry mentioned the implementation really was a March April timeframe so it had nothing to do with the second quarter. What happens though is that I think it was last year during the second or third quarter last year we implemented price increases so on a year to year basis that\u2019s really where the majority of the difference of the benefit of pricing came from.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Okay and in terms of the smart straw could you remind us of where this is being rolled out and what your plans are for additional roll outs? You mentioned you completed the domestic roll out in March and April, what\u2019s left now?", "Garry Ridge", "", "The initial stage, firstly, smart straw is sold as a single SKU in a number of markets around the world. We chose to convert the majority of sizes in the US to smart straw and that happened at the end of March, early April. We\u2019ll be now executing and monitoring that swap over. This was an absolutely enormous endeavor. You know it\u2019s not often that you restage nearly a complete line of product and our folks just did a superb job of doing that. We\u2019ll be watching the roll out. As we build capacity for the smart straw unit itself and then reflect on the final outcomes in the US, we\u2019ll be deciding whether we totally convert other markets over time. But that will be a little bit of a test and see.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "And do you have any significant inventory in the form of the old canned version at the moment that might be at the risk of a revaluation?", "Garry Ridge", "", "No, we don\u2019t have, WD-40 is not an unsalable product, there was some residue inventory that we will be using as some clear outs but no we have nothing to be concerned of. WD-40 has no use by date and we\u2019re able to manage that pretty effectively.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Okay good and then you mentioned a lost distribution channel in terms of the household products is this something that you\u2019re working to reclaim or is this something that\u2019s not economical for you to reclaim?", "Garry Ridge", "", "We didn\u2019t lose any specific distribution channel, maybe it was in my communication but we have continued to lose certain pieces of distribution in certain channels and gained some distribution in other channels over time. We did have an issue with some supply; some of the product, but this being ebbs and flows so there was nothing that was hugely impactful. But it\u2019s just a trend that we continue to see in that really competitive trade channel.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Okay and then just a sort of 30,000 foot question really, you know if you look at your household products segment you\u2019ve seen very good historical growth in Europe, you know perhaps above the growth of the market there and by the same token you\u2019ve seen pretty big declines in the American market. So you know what gives you a competitive advantage in Europe as far as you see and how confident are you that you\u2019ll remain insulated from the competitive pressures you\u2019ve seen build up in the US market over the past two years in terms of your European strength?", "Garry Ridge", "", "Well Europe is a very clear story. We were able to take the innovation of Carpet Fresh which was a product that was developed here in the United States, we matched that with 1001 brand and we were first in the market with a completely game changing innovation in the room and rug deodorizer category. We did the same thing in Australia, so what we did is transplant an innovation into markets where the innovation had not been executed upon. ", "We continued to gain market share in the category of room and rug deodorizers in both Australia and the UK. Without significant entry by a competitor, my belief is probably because it\u2019s not big enough for them to get too excited about it. But you know we have to listen for the alarm bells, but at this stage we\u2019ve now built businesses in Australia and in the UK in the room and rug de-odor category with an aerosol product that is significant and basically unchallenged.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Interesting. And last question, regarding the share repurchases that you\u2019ve completed, any plans to ask the Board for a further authorization?", "Michael Irwin", "", "The Board reviews our capital structure on a quarterly basis and at this stage we have no additional authorization. But just to reflect back on share repurchase, this was one share repurchase authorization that we completed but we did another one several years ago and so we\u2019ve repurchased about $50 million in shares over the past three or four years. So roughly 10% of the shares outstanding over that time period.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Alright and your best guess for diluted share count for the second half of the year is what about 16.7 or something like that?", "Garry Ridge", "", "In the guidance that we gave, we estimated 16.8.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "I\u2019ve got you, okay, alright thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you we\u2019ll take our next question from Cheryl Cortez at Susquehanna Financial.", "Cheryl Cortez \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Hello. I just wanted to, most of my questions have been answered just now but I wanted to get additional color on any innovation products that you\u2019re focusing on for the future.", "Garry Ridge", "", "We haven\u2019t, as we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019ve got a number of things in our pipeline that we\u2019ll be releasing them over time but for obvious competitive and other reasons we don\u2019t really tip our hat on what they are. But certainly as you would have seen, our research and development, our team [inaudible] costs were up in the second quarter so we continued to invest in that activity and are really rigorous about the process and are optimistic that some new product will come out. The new green product in the spot shot category is an example of that and in fact we failed to mention that we are the first green positioned carpet stain remover to be released in the United States. We have a leading edge on that so we\u2019re kind of happy about that.", "Cheryl Cortez \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay. Last year you mentioned placement in major stores was shrunk because of the holiday season. Is some of the, did you see that activity again this year or was it more an economic factor that made [overlay].", "Garry Ridge", "", "Yeah I think you were referring to spot shot in the holiday season of the year before last actually. But there are certain retailers who rotate product in and out to make way for what I call Barbie Dolls and barbeque sets that sell better in the holiday period. That\u2019s a ways off yet, we\u2019re not aware of any of that at this time but I guess that review session will come up in the next 90 days or so.", "Cheryl Cortez \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay, well thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, next we\u2019ll go to Robert Felice at Gabelli & Co.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "Hi, just a couple of quick questions. I guess first Garry I was hoping you could characterize to what extent you think the weakness you experienced domestically is a function of customer de-stocking and to that end is just a timing issue versus a more fundamental or systemic slowdown. And it would seem to me that the bulk of WD-40\u2019s products are load ticket items and to that end should be somewhat resilient to an overall slowdown.", "Garry Ridge", "", "You know what I can tell you is that firstly as far as the economic behavior of our customers, it\u2019s erratic. What I can tell you is that the conversion to smart straw was probably the biggest thing we\u2019ve done in our 50 year history where we basically swapped out a complete line of product. The evidence would have been that we would have maybe expected a buy in of the old product against that because there\u2019s about a 30% lift in price. We didn\u2019t see that, in fact there was excitement about the new product. So we, the amount of promotion that we would have normally had around the WD-40 brand and the inventory at store level of the old product did decline in the second quarter. ", "Which we are now looking to see the other side of that in quarters three and four, we would hope that with the new innovation of smart straw, with the higher retail price, with the enhanced margin for the retailers, the higher dollar ring, that we\u2019re going to get some enthusiastic promotion for the WD-40 smart straw brand through to the end of the year. I\u2019ve been saying since day one of this year that it\u2019s going to be a pretty sort of roller coaster ride for the WD-40 brand in the US throughout the year. ", "There are a number or risks, firstly the risk that we would get the conversion done and as I\u2019ve said I\u2019m extremely proud of our team who executed rigorously to get that conversion done and basically seamlessly, although I\u2019ll tell you there was a lot of work in the background. So we got through that risk and now it\u2019s a matter of us getting the most amount of WD-40 in front of where the most people who use the most are. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. In the household products area, you know we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity going on there as with some economic pressure but I can\u2019t read that, that\u2019s too volatile for us to read. ", "What we need to be concentrating on is innovation like our new spot shot green product and some other product enhancements that we have that we\u2019ll be rolling out in the second quarter and really you know. I have a saying, no doom no gloom just boom. We can convince ourselves, have everybody else convince us that things are worse than they are, I wish we\u2019d declare a recession so we could get out of it, but we\u2019ve just got to do the best we can, get the best promotions we can and fill our consumer needs.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "So it sounds like if I\u2019m reading into it correctly I mean the economic environment really perhaps just noise in the background and the biggest dynamic is really this gap that you had in between that came about as a result from the switch to the old product to the new product in which customers really de-stocking, so there\u2019s just kind of empty period.", "Garry Ridge", "", "I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s noise in the background, what I can tell you is that certainly the behavior of our customer in relation to the WD-40 brand during the conversion period caused us to have less activity at retail for the WD-40 brand than we would have normally had in that period.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "Okay. And then switching gears for a second to the smart straws I was hoping you could kind of help me understand the economics behind it. I know that the pricing on the smart straw will be about $1.00 higher per can at the retail level but I\u2019m trying to get my hands around how much higher the gross margins will be on that product so I can get a sense for the overall incremental contribution a full conversion could have.", "Garry Ridge", "", "That\u2019s a really, really interesting question Rob you know we could freeze the input costs to our product right now, I could hope you\u2019d do that, but because we can\u2019t freeze the input costs to our product, i.e. cans, petroleum, freight and everything associated to that, we are also interested to see how it turns out. What we do know is that we\u2019ve raised our wholesale price 30%; we believe that as we get our production volumes up through smart straw, we\u2019ll gain some production efficiencies. ", "I would expect over time that the margin will enhance because initially any swap to a new production process, the initial period, the volumes are a little off what maximum productivity would be. So I\u2019m with you, what we do know is that we see this as a positive move and hopefully it\u2019ll give us some sort of breather from the absolutely crashing effects that the increase in raw materials have had on us over the past five years.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "And do you see this as a dynamic that could potentially lift your gross margins for the company north of you know say 49-50% over the long term?", "Garry Ridge", "", "I\u2019ve said that one of our stated goals was to get our gross margin back over 50%. This and many other things that we work on everyday are just brutally focused on doing that.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "Okay and then I guess last question you know I know your advertising and sales expenses are quite variable, volatile from period to period but if I look back over the last three years or so your A&S expense has kind of been at the low end of your 6.5-8.5% range. And I\u2019m just wondering should we kind of think about that lower end of that range as more of a normalized level on a percentage of sales basis on any given year perhaps certain dynamics could occur to push it up but that 6.5% level is more the normalized level?", "Garry Ridge", "", "No you shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s why we give a range between 6.5-8.5% and the reason being is there are activities we have planned that are circling around some of the new things we\u2019re doing in spot shot and we anticipate executing on them but then again timing may change that for a particular reason. So the best we can do is give you that range and have you trust us that we\u2019ll execute the best way we can when the time is right and it\u2019s in the best interest of our brands and reaching our consumers.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "Alright well thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "", "Next we\u2019ll move to Frank Magdlen at the Robins Group.", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "Good afternoon Garry. On the roll out of the stain remover, is that through all channels or your normal channels where spot shot is currently found?", "Garry Ridge", "", "Yes it\u2019s two staged, the first stage is the pet product and you\u2019ll already find that in distribution, it\u2019s in Petco and rolling out at other trade channels and you\u2019ll see the other SKU or two SKUs start to go into retail distribution in May and June. And it will be going across all trade channels.", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "All trade channels. And first quarter you had some stock outs and I know that cost you a little bit in distribution possibly but did you have any problem in the second quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "", "We\u2019ve had some continued disruption, not as severe, but certainly it hasn\u2019t been helped by some of this staging of product that we\u2019ve been doing like swapping out or bringing in the new spot shot green product and some other things we\u2019ve been doing but it wasn\u2019t as severe but there was some, still some disruption.", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "All right, one last question on the green product you said it was the first in the US which begs the question is there a competitor available and on another continent or country?", "Garry Ridge", "", "No we think we\u2019ve got to the finish line first on this one.", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "So first worldwide.", "Garry Ridge", "", "We think. Well for the best of our knowledge.", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "Okay that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s good, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "At this time there are no further questions I\u2019d like to turn it over to our presenters for final or closing remarks.", "Garry Ridge", "", "Okay that\u2019s it from us and we\u2019ll see you in about nine days or so.

Before Jay covers the sales and financials in more detail I\u2019d like to highlight some of the challenges and wins of this year. ", "Fiscal 2008 can certainly be characterized as the best of times and the worst of times for WD-40.  We experienced the best of times with increased international growth our WD-40 3-In-One brands, executing on our strategy established back in 1998 of diversification and growth by brands, borders and trade shows. ", "We faced the worst of times with continued rising costs of components and raw materials, sales challenges with our household cleaning brands and deterioration in the economic conditions in the U.S. and in some other parts of the world. Our people worked hard to meet the growing challenges of these dynamic economic times and we refined our diversification strategy to meet the realities of today\u2019s market and into the future. ", "Rising costs of components and raw materials is nothing new; however the volatility and sharp increases we experienced this year particularly in the fourth quarter were unexpected and unprecedented.

", "As you know, oil prices have an effect on oil based products, plastic components and cost of diesel fuel we use to transport our goods to our customers. Steel prices also increased dramatically with a strong demand in China, India and Russia and the emerging markets. WD-40 cans are manufactured from tin plate which increased 20% over the last two years. ", "We have continuously monitored the markets and prepared our teams to respond and adjust to the shifts during these uncertain economic times. While we were able to implement cost containment and margin enhancement strategies we could not shield the company completely from the volatility in commodity pricing this past year, particularly the fourth quarter. We experienced margin erosion as a result. ", "We also experienced higher SG&A expenses which increased 7% during the fiscal year compared to 2008\u2019s prior fiscal year [sic]. Our freight was up however it is important to note that freight costs could have been much higher if the company hadn\u2019t fully implemented an integrated freight management solution. ", "Changes in foreign currency also contributed towards higher SG&A costs. We hired staff to support our growing international operations; our legal expenses went up due to increased activity in litigation, case load and increased intellectual property protection. Also impacting Q4 results was an impairment cost of $1.3 million or $0.05 per share on an after-tax basis related to the indefinite lived intangible assets of the X-14 brand. The impairment charge, a non-cash charge, was triggered by a decline in future forecast sales levels of the X-14 brand due to management\u2019s strategic decision to remove a number of products from the grocery trade channel. That decision resulted from the company\u2019s new diversification strategy developed during the fiscal year 2008. This was the first step in transitioning the brand from its high dependence on the grocery trade channel. ", "In light of these events it could be seen to be the worst of times. However, we do have wins to celebrate, particularly our growth in the international markets.  As we commemorated our 53rd birthday for the first time in WD-40\u2019s company history over half or 53% in fact of the company\u2019s total revenues were generated outside the United States. International product sales of WD-40 alone grew from 57% in fiscal 2007 to 62% in 2008. Jay will cover the regional and product sales in more detail but I\u2019d like to highlight that we experienced 15% growth in Europe in fiscal 2008 due to the new Smart Straw technology, expansion in developing markets and the growth of the 3-In-One professional range of products. ", "China\u2019s sales increased 66% in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. International markets experienced growth this year and helped offset the weakness in the United States. ", "Another win for us this year was the U.S. conversion of our traditional WD-40 product to our new Smart Straw technology. As a successful innovation that has a dual spray and permanent straw attached. This new technology had allowed us to enhance our margins and our customers\u2019 margins while resolving the number one consumer complaint; losing the straw. We\u2019d like to think our customers will never lose that straw again. ", "Following the conversion in April the market demand for the product outpaced supply and we worked hard to ensure adequate stock. While still in early stages, we believe the technology is meeting the consumer\u2019s needs and the technology certainly looks promising. ", "We also launched several new products this year. In the U.S. we were the first to launch a non-toxic and biodegradable carpet stain remover called Spot Shot Pet Clean. We also launched a product called 3-In-One No Mess No Rust Shield, a product that prevents rust and corrosion when placed in small enclosed areas to protect tools and valuables against rust. We also launched 3-In-One Professional Garage Door Lube, incorporating the WD-40 Smart Straw technology. We launched the 3-In-One Professional Range of products in Germany introducing this brand in that country for the first time. ", "We continued to tighten up our new product development process to launch products that will meet our core consumer needs and the company\u2019s strategic direction. ", "Beginning with this fiscal year\u2019s 10K the company will start reporting its products offerings in one of two product categories; multipurpose maintenance products and homecare cleaning products. The WD-40 and 3-In-One brand revenues will report under multipurpose maintenance products and all other brand revenues will report under the homecare and cleaning products category. ", "Now over to Jay who will cover the sales and financial results in more detail. ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "In addition to the information presented on this call we suggest you review our 10K which will be filed next week. Now that Garry has touched on many of the themes of the year, let\u2019s cover the details regarding our sales and financials for the fourth quarter and the financials for the fiscal year in total. ", "Net sales were $76.9 million in Q4, a decrease of 3% versus the fourth quarter last year. Fiscal year 2008 net sales were $317.1 million, an increase of 3% over fiscal 2007. Our results by product line were as follows: Multipurpose maintenance products in Q4 had sales of $58.1 million, an increase of 7% and year-to-date sales of $235.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Looking to our homecare and cleaning products Q4 sales were $18.8 million, down 24% from the prior fourth quarter and the year-to-date sales were $81.2 million, off 11% from the prior year. Our multipurpose maintenance product sales were up in all trade blocks for the fourth quarter and fiscal year driven by continued geographic expansion and growth of the WD-40 Smart Straw in Europe. In April of this year the U.S. also converted many of the WD-40 can sizes exclusively to the Smart Straw. ", "Our core multipurpose products business continues to be a growth opportunity. In fact, it has been generating a compound annual growth rate of 10% between the years fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2008. Decreased sales of homecare and cleaning products in Q4 and the fiscal year were primarily due to sales declines in the U.S. and Europe resulting from some decreases in distribution, some competitive activity and category decline. The homecare and cleaning brands compete in highly competitive markets and are currently facing shifting product categories. While there were pockets of growth in certain countries such as the Carpet Fresh No Vac in Australia, we recognize that homecare and cleaning products continue to be a challenge for the company. ", "Spot Shot sales declined 20% in Q4 and 12% for the fiscal year due to reduced sales to some key customers and overall declines in the aerosol spot and stain category. We are currently transitioning to newer, non-toxic and biodegradable product offerings to replace the Spot Shot trigger which is currently in distribution and also help us gain additional new distribution. ", "2000 Flushes and X-14 automatic toilet bowl cleaning sales declined 36% in Q4 and 15% for the fiscal year due to decreased distribution with key customers, competitive innovation and temporary manufacturing disruptions earlier in the fiscal year. Sales in the entire toilet bowl cleaning category declined in the grocery chain channel where we continue to face increased competition for shelf space. To combat these challenges we are focusing on developing and enhancing distribution channels outside the grocery trade channel as the result of consumer shifts towards the manual cleaning devices we have discontinued our in-bowl products. Our focus is now towards the drop-in category in which we introduced new SKU\u2019s and some product improvements in the fourth quarter. ", "X-14 Hard Surface Cleaner sales declined 43% in Q4 and 38% for the fiscal year primarily due to lost distribution as the result of some competitive activity and again some temporary manufacturing disruptions that resulted in lost sales. In an effort to sustain the brand we are re-aligning our product portfolio to focus investment and distribution on our more competitive items. ", "Carpet Fresh sales declined 12% in Q4 and were virtually flat to the fiscal year. While the brand thrived in Australia it experienced reduced distribution and category declines in the mass and grocery trade channels in the U.S. The category decline is attributed to the reallocation of shelf space from traditional rug and room deodorizers to other air care products. We continue to refine our marketing and promotions and pricing strategies to create new opportunities for the Carpet Fresh brand. ", "Heavy Duty Hand Cleaners which are not categorized under our homecare and cleaning products made up 2% of gross sales in Q4 and for the fiscal year. Total sales of Lava and [Sovo] dipped a bit in the fourth quarter primarily due to soft Lava sales in the U.S. ", "No onto our results by region. The Americas in Q4 had sales of $42.8 million, off 9% from the prior period and for the year the sales were $176.9 million which represents a 5.5% decrease on prior year. Europe represented sales of $26.1 million, up 5% in the fourth quarter and sales of $110.5 million, up 14.5% on the year. Asia Pacific had sales of $8 million in the quarter which were down 14% from the prior year but on the year Asia Pacific sales were $29.7 million, up 22.9% from a year ago. ", "The Americas region is our largest segment covering 56% of total sales in fiscal 2008 versus 61% in the prior fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency rates period-to-period positively impacted sales by $200,000 or about 0.5% in Q4 and $1.5 million or 9% in the fiscal year. Most of the region\u2019s shortfall is due to the U.S. which experienced sales declines of 10% in Q4 and 8% for the year driven by declines in the homecare and cleaning brands and softness in WD-40 sales. The U.S. sales of homecare and cleaning brands fell 28% in Q4 and 15% for the year as the result of reduced distribution, continued competitive pressures as well as the manufacturing disruptions mentioned earlier. ", "WD-40 sales in the U.S. were up in Q4 by 5% yet declined by 3% for the fiscal year as customers reduced inventory levels and in-store promotion activities in response to the slowing U.S. economy. The brand was also impacted by supply constraints for the WD-40 Smart Straw which prompted the company to delay some key promotional activities related to the Smart Straw conversion until fiscal year 2009. ", "Latin America experienced some softness in Q4 but continued to do well for the year growing 19%. Canada sales grew modestly at 6% in Q4 and 4% for the fiscal year. Growth of our multipurpose maintenance product sales in Latin America and Canada partially offset the decline in the U.S. ", "No on to Europe which accounted for 35% of global sales in fiscal 2008 versus 31% in the prior fiscal year. Sales increased 5% in Q4 and 15% for the year driven by the distributor markets and the WD-40 and 3-In-One brands. Changes in foreign exchange rates period-to-period positively affected sales by about $300,000 or 1% in Q4 and $2.4 million or 2% for the fiscal year. We sell to Europe through a combination of direct operations in certain countries and other countries we use marketing distributors. We have a direct sales force in the U.K., Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands. The U.K. was the only direct market to experience a sales decline in Q4 and it declined 22% which caused total sales for the year to fall short by 3% versus fiscal 2007. ", "The softness in Q4 sales resulted from changes in customer specific promotional activities and from some increased competition surrounding the 1001 brand products. The other direct markets experienced sales growth as follows: France grew 30% in Q4 and 35% for the fiscal year. Italy had 15% growth in Q4 and 25% for 2008. Germany, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands combined grew 29% in Q4 and 19% for the fiscal 2008 period. Spain and Portugal grew 2% in Q4 and had a 9% growth for fiscal 2008. ", "We sell through independent marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. These distributor markets combined to increased 19% in Q4 and 22% in fiscal 2008 driven by growth in distribution and usage resulting from increased market penetration and increased brand awareness. ", "Now on to Asia Pacific which grew to account for 9% of the global sales in fiscal 2008 up from 8% in the prior year. Asia Pacific sales increased 14% in Q4 and grew 23% for the year. All three regions, the Asia distributor markets, the direct market of China and the direct market of Australia experienced double digit growth in the fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency rates period-to-period positively impacted sales by $.4 million in Q4 and $1.6 million for the fiscal year. ", "The Asia Pacific region continues to represent long-term growth potential for the company. We began direct operations in China during fiscal 2007 and we are pleased that our sales in China grew by 66% in fiscal 2008. Sales in the Asia distributor markets were essentially flat in Q4 but grew 12% for the year with growth seen in Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, India and Thailand. Sales growth resulted from both increased promotional activity and continued growth in the awareness and increased penetration of the WD-40 brand into those markets. ", "Sales in Australia increased 8% in Q4 primarily due to the Novak brand and 21% for the year which was driven by both the WD-40 and the Novak brands. WD-40 benefited from continued broad distribution across all trade channels and the Novak gained market share in Australia\u2019s growing aerosol rug and room deodorizer category. ", "That\u2019s it for the sales update. Now let\u2019s review the rest of the financials starting in Q4 and then our fiscal 2008 results. ", "Gross margin was 44.8% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 48.7% of sales in Q4 last year. The 3.9% decreased in the margin percentage was due to several factors including increases in cost of raw materials and components, some short-term costs associated with product conversions and sourcing changes that are being made in the U.S., losses sustained in our investments in the related party VML, and an increase in advertising and promotional discounts that are treated as a reduction to sales. ", "Let\u2019s talk about reaching points. As Garry mentioned earlier the rising cost of products that we have seen in the current period are due to some unprecedented cost increases that we have been experiencing for a number of our components and raw materials primarily aerosol cans and petroleum based products. It really had an impact on the fourth quarter. Also negatively impacting fourth quarter margins were short-term costs associated with product conversions and sourcing changes. ", "Product conversions are related to the automatic toilet bowl cleaners and the WD-40 aerosol products resulting in obsolete packaging and other components that were written off and expensed in cost of goods in the period. We had manufacturing disruptions which also led the company to attain additional partners to manufacture and warehouse our goods which resulted in higher short-term costs for some of our homecare and cleaning products. We expect the additional sales and margin opportunities arising from the conversions and sourcing changes to far outweigh the short-term costs of conversion. ", "Losses associated with VML, a related party contract manufacturer also negatively impacted our gross margin in the fourth quarter by $0.6 million. These losses were the result of manufacturing inefficiencies at VML that were recorded as a component of cost of products sold. The decrease in gross margin percentage was also the result of an increase in our advertising and promotional discounts which negatively impacted gross margin by 1.3%. A greater percentage of sales were subject to promotional allowances this quarter due to the overall increase in promotional activity in this quarter versus last year. ", "We also shifted some investment from broad media advertising to more targeted, customer specific promotions and programs which are reported as a reduction in sales. Certain A&P costs such as coupons, customer rebates, [inaudible] programs and slotting are contributing to the reduction in sales and the timing of these promotional activities as well as the shifts in product and customer mix caused fluctuations in our gross margins from period to period. ", "Price increases were implemented in certain of our products worldwide earlier in the fiscal year and this added 1.2 percentage points to our gross margin in Q4 but did not fully offset the cost increases we sustained. We will implement additional price increases in fiscal 2009 to mitigate the gap and we will continue to focus on margin enhancement strategies through our innovation efforts. ", "Those are the highlights of gross margin for Q4. Let\u2019s continue on through the rest of the income statement. Selling, general administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased from $19.5 million to $20.8 million, growing as a percentage of sales from 20.7% to 27%. The increase in SG&A expenditure stems in part from freight costs which increased by $1 million in the quarter due to higher sales as well as higher fuel costs. Advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased slightly in Q4 versus the fourth quarter last year. A&P expenses decreased from $4.9 million to $4.6 million and as a percentage of sales decreased from 6.2% to 6%. ", "The lower level of investment is due to the timing of promotional activities as a portion of our investment was pushed into fiscal 2009 due to supply constraints with the WD-40 Smart Straw. Including the promotional allowances of $4.8 million versus $4.1 million in the same period last year the company\u2019s total investment in A&P activities totaled $9.4 million in Q4 versus $8.9 million in Q4 last year. ", "Amortization expense of $100,000 in the fourth quarter is the result of the 1001 acquisition and was equal to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The fourth quarter results also include a $1.3 million impairment charge related to the X-14 brand that Garry discussed earlier. ", "Operating income for the quarter was $7.6 million compared to $14 million in Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $0.5 million and that was $0.1 million higher than Q4 last year. The increase is really due to lower interest expense offset by even lower interest income. Our interest expense was lower due to the continued reduction in our debt as we made our annual $10.7 million principle payment in October 2007 but we had lower interest income as the result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates in the current year compared to last year. ", "Other income was $0.2 million higher in Q4 as the result of the fiscal year versus Q4 last year. Most of this income was due to foreign currency exchange gains. The provision for income taxes was 36.8% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 32.2% in Q4 last year. The increase in rate is primarily due to higher benefits recognized in fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and those related to municipal bond interests. ", "Net income in Q4 was $4.7 million, a decrease of 50% from Q4 last year. On a diluted per share basis earnings were $0.28 compared to $0.54 in Q4 last year. Diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter fiscal 2008 decreased to 16.6 million shares compared to 17.3 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. ", "Now let\u2019s review our financial results for the fiscal year. Many of the themes and drivers for the fiscal year results are consistent with those we have just discussed. The gross margin was 46.8% of sales in fiscal 2008 compared to 48.4% of sales in fiscal 2007. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to cost increases in raw material components, costs associated with product conversions and source initiatives that were noted in our Q4 discussion and again increases in our discount to net sales. ", "As Garry noted, many of our oil based raw material components experienced double digit cost increases during the fiscal year. That put significant pressures on the company\u2019s margin. Costs associated with VML and short-term costs associated with product conversions and sourcing changes also negatively impacted gross profit for fiscal 2008. ", "We expect the sales and margin opportunities arising from these conversion and sourcing changes to far outweigh the short-term costs of the conversion. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin percentage was the increase in advertising and other discounts which negatively impacted gross margin by 0.8%. ", "Price increases implemented on certain products worldwide only partially offset these cost pressures and added 1.1% to the gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007. Additional price increases are planned for fiscal 2009 and we believe these price increases along with innovation and other margin enhancement strategies will help us to increase our gross margin to historical levels. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year increased to 6.7% to $83.8 million increasing SG&A to 26.4% for fiscal 2008 compared to 25.5% in fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A costs stem in part from freight expenses which increased by $1.5 million as a result of higher sales and fuel costs, changes to foreign currency exchange rates contributing an additional $1.3 million to SG&A expense for the fiscal year, employee related expenses which increased $2 million due to salary increases, additional investment in our sales efforts and higher fringe benefit expense offset by a lower bonus accrual of $1.2 million and our professional service costs which increased $600,000 primarily as the result of increased legal and information technology costs. We also had an increase of $500,000 in the current year due to higher stock based compensation costs. ", "Advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased to $19.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $20.7 million in 2007.  As a percent of sales, advertising and sales promotional expense decreased to 6.3% from 6.7% in the prior year. A portion of advertising and promotion expense was pushed into 2009 due to supply constraints associated with the Smart Straw. We expect to increase our media investment in 2009 as we align our advertising sales promotion activities with the distribution of our new and existing products. ", "Including the promotional allowances the company\u2019s total A&P investment for the year totaled $38.7 million for fiscal 2008, up from the $37.4 million in 2007. Amortization expense was $600,000 in both 2008 and 2007. As we noted in the Q4 discussion the company recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million for the X-14 brand. ", "Operating income for 2008 was $42.7 million compared to $49 million in 2007. Net interest expense for fiscal 2008 was $1.7 million compared to $2 million in the prior year. Other income was $1 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $0.2 million in fiscal 2007, primarily driven by foreign currency exchange gains. The provision from income taxes was 34.2% for fiscal 2008, an increase from 33.2% in the prior fiscal year. The change in tax rate is due primarily to one-time benefits from favorable rulings on tax matters as well as along with significantly higher municipal income interest in fiscal 2007. The loss of these benefits in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by increased benefits related to qualified production activities for the current year. ", "Net income in 2008 was $27.6 million compared to $31.5 million in fiscal 2007. On a diluted per share basis earnings were $1.64 versus $1.83 in 2007. Diluted outstanding shares decreased to 16.8 million for the year compared to 17.3 million for the prior year. Regarding the dividend, on October 6, 2008 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on October 31, 2008 to shareholders of record on October 17, 2008. Based on today\u2019s closing price of $28.10, the annualized dividend and yield would be 3.6%. ", "About our balance sheet at August 31, cash and cash equivalents were $42 million down from the $61.1 million at the end of the fiscal year. In addition to the $10 million in principle payment on our debt and $16.7 million of dividend payments, we acquired $17.7 million of common stock through the year. Accounts receivable increased to $49.3 million up $2.1 million from the end of the last fiscal year primarily as the result of timing. ", "Inventories increased to 18.3 million, up by 5.1 million from the end of last year. The increase in inventory is due to new product introductions and sourcing with alternative manufacturers in the U.S. as well as the acquisition of much of the manufactured inventory from VML. Certain finished goods were owned and warehoused by VML and under the company\u2019s historical contract packager model. As the company transitioned to direct management of these finished goods it acquired inventory from VML to supply its distribution centers. The purchase of the VML manufactured goods will continue as we go forward. ", "Current liabilities were $54.6 million up from $53.9 million at the end of fiscal 2007. Our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $0.5 million due to timing of payments. Crude, payroll and related expenses were down $0.8 million primarily due to decreased bonus accruals. Income taxes payable increased $1 million in the current year due to the timing of payment for income taxes. ", "That is the financial update for fiscal 2008. More information will be available on our 10K that will be filed this week. ", "Before Garry moves into his closing remarks I would like to briefly address the outlook for our gross margin, the impact of our relationship with VML and the sales challenges in our homecare and cleaning brands. Our gross margin eroded with the double digit increases in costs of raw materials related to our multipurpose maintenance products business particularly in the back half of the fiscal year. While we instituted selling price increases the timing and amount of those price increases only partially offset the entire cost of our products. We do expect our gross margin on our multipurpose maintenance products to improve with additional price increases planned for 2008 as well as manufacturing efficiencies we gained with the Smart Straw production scale. ", "Also, we expect margin improvement on our homecare and cleaning products as we transition to alternative manufacturers and bring innovation to the segment. That brings me to the second point, the impact of our relationship with VML. VML has been our primary partner for sourcing homecare and cleaning products and for warehousing and distribution. While the relationship had served the company well, VML began to have manufacturing inefficiency issues this past year that resulted in lost sales and margin. These events led the company to employ alternative and secondary manufacturers and partners. The company incurred some initial start up costs as the result of this sourcing transition as well as loss on the investment in VML. We may incur some additional short-term spend but we believe these changes will result in margin and product quality improvement in the long-term. ", "The last item I would like to address is our homecare and cleaning brands which have had sales and margin challenges. All of our brands under this segment compete in highly competitive categories. Maintaining and growing sales has been very difficult in some of our brands due to the very large competitors in this space that have greater resources to support heavier media and other advertising. The competitive nature of these categories have also made selling price increases difficult to implement and as a result we have not been able to cover all rising costs of material and have experienced merchant erosion over time. We will continue to support innovation which is critical to maintaining sales and margin for these brands. We recently rolled out several new products in the Spot Shot and 2000 flushes brand and have significant advertising and promotions resources slated to support them in fiscal 2009. ", "We do believe innovation along with cost reductions achieved through new sourcing will help our performance in the homecare and cleaning brands in 2009. ", "That completes the sales and financial update. Now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "", "We consider WD-40 Company a long-term investment in your diversified portfolio and as such we\u2019d like to share with you why it is fundamentally strong and stable. First, we pay close attention to our credit exposure. The company has strong credit relationships with large and trusted financial organizations and we will continue to manage these relationships closely. We monitor the health of our supplies and major customers as well as financial vendors to ensure we minimize the exposure to third-party relationships. ", "To minimize our credit risk we use credit insurance with our international distributor markets. We also monitor our direct sales markets very closely and the company has historically had bad debt levels that have been low as a result of these efforts. ", "Second, we have a strong balance sheet. However, our debt is low and we continue to de-lever the company. We have $42 million remaining on our original $75 million fixed rate term loan which we reduce to $32.2 million of our principle payment in just a few days. The company remains in compliance with all its debt covenants. We also have access to an additional borrowing if needed with a $10 million credit facility available. ", "Third, we implement best practices with our working capital and cash management strategies that has the company with strong free cash flow. We have cash available for investments and cash to fund the regular quarterly dividends and operating activities. Over the past 55 years our company has fared well in difficult times and we will continue managing the business to ensure long-term sustainability. ", "Our objective for fiscal year 2009 is to continue to deliver value to our shareholders despite the adverse economic conditions. Ultimately we will deliver value by providing products of choice for consumers. We want to give consumers the ability to choose by developing and acquiring products that consumers buy in our global distribution channels of demonstrated strength where we have the right to win. We want products that create the same positive, lasting memories as our hero product WD-40. ", "That said we invested time and resources this past year in reviewing our strategy with the objective of answering the following questions. Where do we now have the right play and win? All the work we\u2019ve done in this past year has now confirmed a shift in our belief and that is we must now focus on adjacent business opportunities by leveraging the WD-40 and 3-in-one brands. We believe this focus will provide us with the best global opportunities. ", "This means that we will look, develop and/or acquire more products under our core multipurpose maintenance products business and leverage the distribution channels where we have this high level of competency. It also means we will continue to diversify through global development and expansion. The new direction has also led us to revise our corporate logo to reflect the likeness and maximize the power and association of the WD-40 brand. We feel this will help address the company\u2019s need to leverage our famous brand while preserving the unique position the brand has in the hearts of many consumers around the world. ", "While the following guidance for fiscal 2009 does not include an acquisition, we believe that the turbulent times are creating greater numbers of attractively valued acquisition opportunities than in the past few years. Our strong balance sheet and good business model will enable us to execute on acquisition opportunities that are the right fit. ", "Our guidance for the fiscal year is as follows. We expect our sales to grow between 2-8% to $323 to $343 million driven by continued geographic expansion and market penetration in those markets and new products. We expect our investment in global advertising and promotion expense to rise between 6.5-8.5% and we expect net income of $27.4 to $30.7 million which would achieve an EPS range of somewhere between $1.60 and $1.85 assuming 16.6 million shares outstanding. ", "While we do not run our business on a short-term quarterly basis, or generally by the quarterly basis, we would like to share our Q1 outlook as well. Q4 was a tough period negatively impacted by short-term events and transitions. It is absolutely no more like business as usual. We believe our results in Q4 were an aberration and we are seeing a recovery in sales and the bottom line in Q1. ", "With that we will share our guidance for Q1. We expect sales to grow to between $81.5 and $84.7 million in Q1. We expect our investment in global advertising and promotional expense to range between 6.5-9.5% and we expect net income of between $6.6 and $7.4 million which will achieve EPS of between $0.40 and $0.45 per share assuming 16.6 million shares outstanding. ", "Thank you very much for joining us today. We\u2019d be pleased to answer any of your questions from what seems to be a marathon call. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan. ", "Ben Richardson for Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I just wanted to discuss business conditions in Europe for a moment. We noticed you had about 5% sales growth. We considered that you probably had a currency benefit, possibly 10% in the quarter and I just wondered if you might speak to price and volume trends in Europe as you see them. ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "The currency benefit was relatively small in the quarter. If we look at the end of the year in Europe we had really a number of markets that had phenomenal growth through the first three quarters and in some ways it was really just phasing as some of those markets adjusted to the higher level of volumes they had seen. So we don\u2019t see what may be a lower level of fourth quarter revenues in Europe as being indicative of what the future is going to bring.", "Garry Ridge", "", "In fact, the guidance that we have given for the first quarter would anticipate that you would see a reasonable growth in Europe in the first quarter. ", "Ben Richardson for Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I guess speaking to those factors impacting gross margin. Firstly, the product conversion costs and sourcing changes, can you go into a bit of detail concerning those factors? ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "We have had a number of new introductions and conversions of old products which as you move into the new from the old depending on if you have a soft cut up or a hard cut up you have some additional packaging component material that is left over. So some of those conversion costs were associated with that as we had a number of new products that were being introduced and changes. Some of the costs were associated with changes in our manufacturing partnership and those were costs associated with inefficiencies associated with new runs on new lines and kind of getting a new production facility up to speed. So a number of those costs are not expected to repeat as we go forward. ", "Garry Ridge", "", "We also had increased freight costs as part of our cost of goods as we were shipping product from a new manufacturer to other warehouses and those costs should also normalize as we go forward. So again those are a number of activities that cause that. ", "Ben Richardson for Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Lastly on the topic of raw materials, given the decline in oil prices, even steel has backed off a bit, in how many quarters do you expect to see raw material turn positive? Is that possible? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "Let\u2019s break it into two. Let\u2019s talk about oil first. Oil is down to around $75 today. We\u2019ve got a fair tail on that and that\u2019s why we had such an upswing in Q4. So certainly if oil stays down where it is we\u2019re going to get a positive advantage. The good side of that is both of the major tin plate can manufacturers released to the market a number of months ago they expected steel tin plated cans to increase in price anywhere up to 90% in January. The latest indications we have got is that percentage increase could be anywhere between 45-60%. So although we will see some offset on oil we had not anticipated that level of price rise on our tin plate can purchases. This has been widely announced and discussed. So certainly we would have hoped to have seen some back off but that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. Our tin can suppliers have been reluctant to confirm what they think the number is because I don\u2019t think they know either. I think it is going to be somewhere in the vicinity of the range that I shared. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC. ", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Garry thanks for your discussion of your credit procedures. It was very helpful. I\u2019d just like to clarify my understanding of your expectations regarding the factors that impact your gross margins. You discussed oil. You discussed tin plate. It seems the other factors, the product conversions, sourcing changes, losses at VML, increases in discount costs for A&P, they look like kind of one-time items really that perhaps shouldn\u2019t impact so much for next year. Is that a fair appraisal? ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "I think that would be the case with the exception of the discounts. Those move around period to period depending on the mix of marketing activities. So depending on the activities are focused on specific customer trade-type promotions we will see more discount related activities. If we do broad consumer based advertising activities those costs are reduced. So it really varies quarter by quarter. ", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Did you discuss at all any progress on your cost containment efficiencies program you talked about during the last all? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "That continues on an ongoing, 24/7 basis. Certainly one of the reasons we changed manufacturers of our automatic toilet bowl cleaners was to get a margin enhancement. So we are working on that. We are working on enhancing margins through innovation, through packaging changes, through rationalization. Certainly we will get a lift in our margin on Smart Straw as we enter next year and all of the high speed automation comes on line. So those are some of the things we have been working on. ", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "So what you are saying really is that things are looking very positive there on your margins, apart from this potential increase in tin plate cans we might expect in January? ", "Garry Ridge", "The thing we have been able to do is we implemented another price increase that took effect in the U.S. on the first of October of about 10%. That has gone through. We have accelerated our price increases. We think we have a handle on most things except for the volatility and uncertainty in steel and oil. But we have been able to offset that with some pricing. We would hope we are going to see an expansion of our gross margin as we go forward unless something doesn\u2019t happen or happens that we don\u2019t know. Today, that could probably happen. There are questions we ask ourselves today we would never bother to ask ourselves two weeks ago. So we\u2019ll see where it goes. ", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Your guidance that you mentioned for the year and for first quarter that seemed to imply to me you\u2019re going to have much flatter seasonality next year than you have experienced the last couple of years. Is that a fair point and if so what is causing that? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "No. What it should indicate to you is we are really uncertain looking further out. That is what it should tell you. We feel comfortable with our guidance for this quarter but we are not in a position to and we feel okay about the year but we need to get through the can increase and we need to get through what happens to our bumpy Q4. What we are happy about is we are seeing Q1 coming out strong for us with sales growth and I think if we can weather the storm through that we will give you more information at the end of Q2. Again, we thought it was best to give you that visibility. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer. ", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Just a few questions here on the top line. In terms of guidance, it looks like it is pretty wide for 2009. Where are sort of the unknown or the biggest unknown? Is it the U.S. you are unsure about or is it Europe? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "Do you think I can answer that question Joe? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m unsure of these days. I think what we do know is there are indicators for us that tell us we\u2019ve got growth going forward but I don\u2019t know where things are going to go. We know what is going on in our business but we don\u2019t know what is going to happen in the world around us. So I think that is why we have been wide. We have been probably a little less wide in this quarter guidance because we\u2019ve got a better feel for that. So to us it is a bit like how far do the headlights of a car see down the road? Well it depends how far the car is traveling down the road. Again, these are not times of business as usual and you probably know that much better than I do. ", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer", "In terms of the first quarter you said you are seeing sales growth thus far in the quarter. Is that in both of those regions? Is one region doing better than the other? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "We are seeing growth across the world. We are seeing growth in the U.S. because of Smart Straw and some of our other brands. We are seeing good geographic growth. We\u2019re seeing growth in all of our geographic locations. ", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer", "In terms of the accounting for the foreign exchange impact maybe I am missing something. If Europe is about 1/3\u2026actually greater than 1/3 of your sales and the Euro has been extremely weak relative to the dollar in the quarter since probably July why are you not seeing a greater FX impact? ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "Our FX impact we have got a couple of FX impacts. We really have our European business is really driven out of Sterling. So in Europe our sales are recorded and booked in Sterling so when they get converted to the U.S. because of those changes in the quarter year-over-year the impact was smaller than it has been in the past. ", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer", "But the Sterling has been relatively weak as well hasn\u2019t it? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "It got weak into the end of the fourth quarter. The real weakness has been in the last 5-6 weeks. ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "We get the gain from foreign exchange when the Sterling is strengthening because it converted at 2:1 instead of 1.7. ", "Garry Ridge", "", "That is why one other thing our guidance reflects for next year is the impact of for a full year the Sterling going from 2 to what is probably 1.7. So we are actually losing sale growth in our consolidation from Europe in these numbers for next year. Probably to the tune of a couple million. ", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Lastly, on the supply disruptions and the transition from VML, do you see any additional chance of further disruptions going forward or do you think that is behind you at this point? ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "I think we are comfortable with the move we made and I think we see most of the hiccups have gone through the system. I think we are fairly positive on the outlook with respect to that situation. I think as Garry talked earlier this isn\u2019t business as usual. I think that some of our concerns and some of our focus is really on the health of all of our supplier base. So that is an area that we watch very closely as well. ", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Are you seeing any weakness in your other suppliers thus far in terms of credit and things like that? ", "Jay Rembolt ", "", "Nothing that we have identified at this time. ", "Operator", "", " The next question comes from Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "First, I wanted to key back on a previous question related to variance around the guidance. I was hoping you could highlight some of the underlying assumptions that you are baking into the high end and the low end of the range. As you mentioned it is pretty unprecedented times and perhaps that would give us greater clarity around the sensitivity of the guidance. ", "Garry Ridge ", "", "I think the guidance really if you look at it the swing is in our sale number. What is the economic condition of our customers going to be like and how are they going to react. I think the biggest variance is the overall economic conditions that are in front of us now. ", "Jay Rembolt", "", "In addition to that we also are aware of the potential impact of the steel and potential additional volatility in the oil as well. Somewhat conservative in our expectations with respect to commodities in general. ", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "So you are not anticipating raw material costs being a significant headwind or tailwind either way? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "I think there is one headwind and one tailwind. There is a probably tailwind of oil and a probable headwind of steel. ", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "But on a net basis? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "I think there is probably a little headwind there now. We don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t had the final confirmation of the steel tin price increase yet so it is only an assumption. ", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "What was the magnitude of the delta during the fourth quarter between raw material cost increases and pricing? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the gap was and what is left to be made up. ", "Garry Ridge", "", "I don\u2019t know that we have that number. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from William Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott. ", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Garry on X-14 you said you were going to\u2026you obviously had written down some trademark value and you are going to reposition it in the distribution channel. Are you going to completely take it out of grocery or is it going to be more specialized through the hardware chain? How is that going to be repositioned? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "Liam what we have looked at very seriously is the whole point is where we have the right to win. In that bathroom area with the expansion of products like the new green products from Clorox and others we have not got the power to win with that product in that category. So we decided we\u2019re not going to throw our investment behind that. So I think what will happen is we will still maintain the premier position we have with our X-14 high end mildew products. Then we\u2019re going to look at where else the brand might be able to travel and more so along to the other trade channels that we have. We basically are out of those general purpose bathroom cleaners where margins were tight, competition is hard and we really just didn\u2019t have a right to win. ", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "So essentially you\u2019ll be in the grocery channel with just one product and that is the mildew remover? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "Yes. ", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "1001 in the U.K. how did that do? ", "Joe Rembolt", "", "It had some weakness in the quarter and was off. ", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Garry on the Spot Shot on the non-aerosol and the green product how did that do? I know the aerosol was sort of being de-emphasized. ", "Garry Ridge", "", "The aerosol is not being de-emphasized. We\u2019re in the stages of launch and transferring the original pump product into the new environmentally friendly, non-toxic VOC free product. So promotional activity on that is commencing within the next couple of weeks in line with a movie that is being launched and still building distribution. So I think we\u2019ll have a better picture on that in the next 60-90 days but I think we are progressing okay. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group. ", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "On the gross margin you said the goal was to get back to historic levels. Is that the recent historic level of say the 48%? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "I don\u2019t know. I keep saying and I am going to continue to say this business model was built on an assumption of a gross margin north of 50%. We need to get back there and we have been struggling with that for four years now. I think what you are going to see from what we know today in the fiscal year coming 2009 you are going to see us start to go in the right direction towards that. How fast and how much will depend on what the steel prices are, how our price raises fall in and anything else I don\u2019t know about. ", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "Did you have any stock options? Did you lose significant sales because of the product conversions and change in sourcing? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "One of the biggest areas was in our Smart Straw. Demand outpaced our production capacity in the last five weeks of the year. That really was a flow on from, if you remember when we converted the Smart Straw back in April we had an anticipation that our customers would buy out the classic product because of the increase in the price. They didn\u2019t. The outcome of that was we had a poor Q2 in WD-40 and we had hoped that as transition happened we could build inventory of Smart Straw to be able to support the demand as we got through to the end of the year. In fact we were living hand-to-mouth on Smart Straw right through the end of the year as it was only in the last weeks of August we got full production on line of the second supplier of the actual Smart Straw unit itself. ", "That is why we then ended up with a major part of the Smart Straw promotion pushing into the first quarter of this year and we had some classic products left over we then cleared out. So it was a consequence of that whole effect that we never got a chance to build inventory so we weren\u2019t maximizing our opportunity with Smart Straw. I believe we are through that now and we\u2019ve got the full production on line. I believe our production capacity will increase over the next month as we finish installing some new high speed equipment that actually puts the straw on the can. Right now it is being done by hand and these new machines are going in to play that will increase our production ability. I think we are through that. ", "On the household products area we did have some disruption as we transitioned our manufacturing of our automatic toilet bowl cleaners from one production site to another. Not material but some hiccup. More of a cost issue really on gross margin because we were paying either inflated freight rates because we were moving products from one warehouse to another to meet orders instead of being able to source product directly from the manufacturer. We are balancing stock a little more. So a lot more extra costs in our cost of goods just to keep in supply as we balance stock around the warehouses that had inventory but not necessarily in the place we wanted it. ", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "So I take that to mean you lost some sales? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "Yes, we would have lost some but I think in the household area it wasn\u2019t significant. Certainly there was a reasonable loss in the Smart Straw. ", "Joe Rembolt", "", "That is in the quarter. In the year-to-date, in the first part of the year we did lost probably $1 million or more of sales in the household products category. ", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "Garry when I looked at the long-term goals that you put up on your web site and you put up in your investor presentations are you inclined to change that at this time? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "We will update that in December. ", "Frank Magdlen \u2013 Robins Group", "On the X-14, is there anything left to write off on that impairment charge? Did you take it all or just part? ", "Joe Rembolt", "", "Just part of it. There is a little left. ", "Operator", "", "We have a follow-up question from Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "You talked about the fourth quarter here being somewhat of an aberration in terms of performance and you have given us guidance on the first quarter and it seemed relative to the fiscal year 2009 guidance that the back half of next year will be pretty weak or baked in the possibility of some substantial weakness. Why is that, especially in light of the fourth quarter? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "We don\u2019t know. That is why. We are not comfortable. We have given a guidance range in the full year but we\u2019re unsure what the economic conditions are going to be 3-6 months from now. I think not having that comfort zone then it would be irresponsible of us to say that we felt we could swim against the tide. So it is really because we don\u2019t know the impact of the current economic turmoil. It is not business as usual so we can see closer in and we feel we understand where we may end up and that is why the range is as wide as it is because we just don\u2019t know. We know our business but we don\u2019t know what is happening in the broader market. If you find anybody that does can you give them my number? I could really use it. ", "Operator", "", "We have a follow-up question from Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC. ", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Garry can you discuss how attractive are the acquisition opportunities out there? Are they attractive enough for your board to think about sacrificing the dividend if need be? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "We look at the dividend on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We understand the dividend is an important part of the investment consideration of the shareholders. At this stage we haven\u2019t had any discussions around that. ", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Are you more predisposed for smaller, tuck in acquisitions? Or is everything on the table? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "I think it is a matter of looking at we are certainly conservative. I think you know that. We\u2019re not going to make dumb business decisions and put ourselves at risk for the big prize that is maybe not there. We would like to think we can pull tuck-in acquisitions in pretty easily. So we are very actively looking around. We\u2019d like to see private companies that need help, particularly in this current circumstance. We are looking but I don\u2019t think you will find us doing something that will have you saying, \u201cOh my God why did they do that?\u201d", "Alan Robinson \u2013 RBC", "Presumably this discussion over the use of cash will still include the potential of share buybacks? ", "Garry Ridge", "", "We have done share buybacks. We have had dividend increases. We have paid down debt. The management and the finance committee every quarter look at our balance sheet and look at our cash needs, think about what it is we want and where we want to go and we make decisions based around that. We bought $60 million plus worth of our stock back in the last couple of years while paying down $30 million worth of debt, while paying out $15-16 million worth of dividends and still retaining $46 million cash.  So I think I best explain it as a balanced, responsible fiscal approach. ", "Operator", "", "There are no further calls.", "Garry Ridge", "That is a marathon that is for sure. It is always nice to talk to you. We hope that whatever is going on out there today you and your families are not being impacted adversely and we\u2019ll certainly get on and do the best we can to deliver the best results we can over the next period of time. As I said it is not business as usual but we\u2019re not people as usual. Thanks very much. "]}

", "At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Garry Ridge.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Good day, Happy New Year to you all and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. ", "Today we reported net sales of $83.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 5.6% over Q1 last year.", "Net income for the first quarter was $7.7 million, up 23.4% compared to Q1 last year.", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.46, up from $0.36 in Q1 last year.", "We are pleased with these results and the continued growth of our international markets, but they did not come without challenges. The reality this quarter continues to be volatility and uncertainly in economies, raw materials, and foreign exchange rates, all of which significantly impacted our business.", "Deteriorating economic conditions across the globe challenged our top line. Volatility in raw materials and the timing of the flow of those into the cost of goods impacted our margin. ", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted the company in two ways: in international markets where we sell in U.S. dollars, made our goods effectively more expensive where local currencies have fallen against the dollar, and more significantly, falling exchange rates reduces the sales and profits from our growing international segments.", "Q1 2009 results translated at last year\u2019s first quarter exchange rates would have produced net sales of $89.1 million and net income of $8.6 million, thus excluding the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates, quarter-over-quarter net sales and net income would have increased by 13% and 39% respectively.", "So let\u2019s dig into the details. Our results by product line were as follows. Multi-purpose maintenance product sales were up 15% globally in the first quarter with sales gains in all three trading blocs versus Q1 of last year. The increase was driven by the continued growth and penetration of both multi-purpose brands, WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE, which grew 14% and 22% respectively in Q1 over last year.", "Home care and cleaning products were down 18.8% globally in the first quarter, primarily due to sales decline in the United States. Sales of our home care and cleaning products in the Americas were down 24% in Q1 versus prior-year periods as a result of overall category declines. ", "The decrease in the Americas was partially offset by a 15% increase in sales of home care and cleaning products in Europe in the first quarter versus the first quarter last year.", "Our home care and cleaning products include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, 1001, X-14 and Lava and Solvol brands. Spot Shot sales declined 19% in Q1 due to less distribution and overall declines in the aerosol spot and stain category. The declines in the aerosol category are due to retailers reducing shelf space for aerosol spot and stain removers. ", "In an effort to provide consumers with an environmentally-friendly solution, and to offset some of the Spot Shot sales declines, we developed and launched environmentally-friendly products, which are non-toxic and biodegradable. We are currently using the new, non-toxic, and biodegradable product offerings to both replace existing Spot Shot trigger product distribution and to obtain additional and new distribution where possible.", "2000 Flushes and X-14 automatic toiler bowl cleaners declined 29% in Q1 due to the decreased distribution with customers and as a result there has been an overall decline in the entire toilet bowl-cleaning category. As part of the category trends, the customers are running less shelf space and consolidating this category. ", "To respond to these changing trends, we are increasing the use of consumer-orientated marketing tactics that include coupons and in-store promotional activity, as well as focusing on developing and enhancing distribution channels outside the grocery trade channel.", "Carpet Fresh sales declined 14% in Q1 due to the reduction of distribution and category declines in mass retail and the grocery trade channel in the U.S. the 20% decline in the Americas was partially offset by a modest of 6% in the Asia/Pacific segment. The category decline in the U.S. is attributed to the relocation of shelf space from traditional rug and room deodorizers to other air care products. We continue to refine our marketing and promotions and pricing strategies to create new distribution opportunities for the Carpet Fresh brand.", "1001 sales fared well in the U.K. in Q1 with sales at 15% in quarter versus the same period last year. The increase was due to promotional timing and activity for the products and a regained distribution of the NoVac-like product with a key customer.", "X-14 hard surface cleaner sales declined 41% in Q1 primarily due to lost distribution as a result of competitive activities, but really as well as in line with the recent strategic decision we made to withdraw certain product offerings from the grocery trade channel.", "We have two heavy-duty hand cleaner brands which are now categorized under home care and cleaning products, both experienced sales declines in Q1 of about 17% in aggregate as compared to the same period last year. The decline is attributed to the reduced sales of a key customer as a result of competitive activities as well impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.", "Now, let\u2019s look a little bit at the geographic segments. Despite strong gains in local currencies, sales from our international segments grew modestly once converted into the U.S. dollars. The impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates quarter-over-quarter negatively affected global net sales by $5.5 million, or 6%.", "The Americas continues to be our largest segment, remaining at 54% of total sales. Despite fantastic growth in Europe and Asia/Pacific in local currencies, these segments stayed flat in terms of percentage of the total sales, making up 36% and 10% of global sales in the period respectively.", "Sales in the Americas increased to $45.5 million in Q1, up $2.0 million, or 5% versus Q1 of fiscal last year. Changes in foreign currency rates during that period versus period last year had a minimal unfavorable on the Americas sales of approximately $300,000, or 7/10 of 1%.", "The Americas sales increase in the period was due to higher multi-purpose maintenance product sales across the entire segment. Despite significant sales declines across most of the home care and cleaning brands, the U.S. and Latin American area grew total sales by 5% and 9% respectively and Canada netted out flat in Q1.", "The U.S. experienced strong growth of WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE products of 30% and 29% respectively. The increase in sales of WD-40 was attributed to price increases and increased promotional activity during the quarter as well as the conversion of several can sizes to the Smart Straw format during the third quarter of fiscal 2008.", "The WD-40 Smart Straw format has a higher selling price than the traditional WD-40 cans and U.S. sales of the 3-IN-ONE brand increased due to price increases on many of the 3-IN-ONE oil products and increased distributions.", "Sales in multi-purpose maintenance products in the U.S. in the first quarter were heavily offset by declines across the following home care products: 17% for Spot Shot, 20% for Carpet Fresh, 43% for X-14 liquids, and 31% for 2000 Flushes and X-14 automatic toilet bowl cleaners, and 17% for Lava.", "As mentioned earlier, these brands continue to suffer from lost or reduced distribution related to the overall category declines, reduced shelf space at the retailers, and shift in product categories  and competitive factors.", "We continue to invest in these brands to minimize the impact of these challenges through marketing, promotions, and pricing strategies, as well as supportive innovation, SKUs, and exploring new distribution channels that are less reliant on the grocer trade channel.", "Spot Shot is a great example of these efforts, as we just kicked off our year-long campaign to support our new, environmentally-friendly trigger product with the movie release of Marley and Me. Our comprehensive consumer-targeted campaign includes commercial advertising on TV and in movie theaters, discounts and free purchases with promotions with the movie and the DVD release, print ads in magazines, and special in-store displays.", "This promotion also coincides with the expanding of our distribution into retail trade channels, such as the pet specialty retail trade.", "As for Canada, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products increased 19% primarily due to the price increases and additional promotional activities. The sales increases were fully offset by lower Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes and automatic toilet bowl cleaner sales, which declined 33% and 22% respectively in Q1, versus the same period last year.", "Sales growth in Latin America of 9% for the quarter was due to price increases, increased distribution with new customers, and increased promotional activity with a key customer. Latin America has negligible home care and cleaning product sales.", "Now over to Europe, which accounted for 36% of global sales in Q1 of both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, although Europe experienced a large lift in sales in local currencies, changes in foreign exchange rates during the period versus the period last year negatively impacted the growth of sales.", "Had foreign exchange rates stayed flat to Q1 last year, Europe sales in Q1 of 2009 would have increased by approximately $6.6 million, or 23%, versus the 6% net growth reported as a result of actual exchange rates. All brands that are sold in Europe continued the growth but the sales performance varied across markets.", "We sell into Europe through a combination of direct operations in certain countries, as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in other countries. We have our direct sales force in the U.K., Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and in the markets we term the German region, which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, and The Netherlands. Overall sales from these direct markets were flat in the first quarter. ", "The U.K. and France were the only direct market to experience sales growth in U.S. dollars in Q1 at 17% and 11% respectively. These gains were offset by some decreases in other direct markets. Period versus period sales in U.S. dollars in the German region fell 18%, declines 20% in Italy, and Spain and Portugal slipped 5%.", "The U.K. market benefited from sales growth of WD-40 Smart Straw, 3-IN-ONE, and 1001 products due to increased promotional activity for all products and the regained distribution of 1001 NoVac with a key customer.", "The sales growth in France was the result of increased promotional activity and continued growth in sales of the WD-40 brand, including WD-40 Smart Straw and the increased distribution of the 3-IN-ONE professional line of products.", "The sales decline in the German region was due to reduced promotional activity during the period and while the sales decline in Italy, Spain, and Portugal was due to customers reducing inventory levels in response to their economies. Italy was further impacted by some increased competitor activity during the period.", "We sell through exclusive independent marketing distributors in Eastern and North Europe and in the Middle East and Africa. With virtually all sales consisting of the WD-40 brand these distributor markets combined increased 16% in Q1 versus the same period last year.", "Let\u2019s move on now to Asia/Pacific, which accounted for approximately 10% of global sales in Q1 of fiscal 2009. Asia/Pacific sales increased 10% with sales gains of 16% in the Asia distributor markets, 30% in China, and a net sales decline of 5% in Australia.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, period versus period, negatively impacted the growth of sales. Had foreign exchange rates stayed flat at Q1 last fiscal year, Asia/Pacific sales for Q1 2009 would have increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 14%, versus the 10% net growth reported as a result of the actual exchange rates.", "Sales in Asia increased 19% in Q1 versus the same quarter of fiscal year last year, primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 products to customers across the entire region, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.", "Sales in China increased 30% due to price increases, increased promotional activities, new distribution channels, and our continued development of our direct sales activity in China.", "Sales across the rest of the region increased 16% due to promotional activity. Despite these gains we have begun to see a slowdown in certain markets as a result of the overall economic uncertainty across the region, which may impact sales for the remainder of fiscal 2009.", "The sales decline in Australia was due entirely to changes in foreign exchange rates. In the local currency sales increased 10% due to price increases across all product lines, promotional activities, and new distribution across all trade channels. The devaluation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar reduced total sales by $400,000 upon conversion, or 13% of total sales.", "That\u2019s it for the sales update for now. Now it\u2019s over to Jay Rembolt who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "In addition to the information presented on this call, we suggest that you review our 10-Q that will be filed later on this week.", "I will move on to the rest of the financials. Gross profit for the quarter was 46.3% of sales compared to 47.3% of sales in Q1 last year. The 1% decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher cost of goods as well as increased promotional allowances. These were partially offset by our price increases.", "In looking at the cost of goods sold impact, costs have risen for components and raw materials during the first quarter of this year compared to last year and these are materials, primarily petroleum-based products as well as aerosol cans. We have recently started to see relief with declines in the cost of oil-related products but those decreases are just now starting to make their way into our finished goods.", "We expect the benefit of lower oil-based costs to be offset by higher aerosol can costs starting in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. Our higher aerosol can costs are being driven by higher prices for tin plate and despite the softening of steel prices, the cost of tin plate to our can suppliers has risen significantly.", "Further impacting Q1 costs were losses associated with VML Company and the remaining costs associated with product conversions and sourcing changes made in the U.S. during Q4 last year. Losses from VML, a related party contract manufacturer, negatively impacted gross margin by 0.3% during the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year.", "These losses were the result of manufacturing inefficiencies related to their acquisition of a significant new customer during fiscal 2008. This investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and our share of earnings or losses in VML is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. As of November 30, our remaining carrying value of our equity investment in VML is down to only $200,000.", "Costs associated with product conversions and the sourcing changes implemented in fiscal 2008 negatively impacted this quarter\u2019s gross margin by 0.2% and we expect the additional sales in margin improvement from these initiatives to outweigh the short-term costs of these conversions.", "To mitigate the impact of the higher component and raw material costs, we implemented price increases across all trade blocks during fiscal 2008 as well as in the first quarter of this year. The price increases added 3.3% to our gross margin but did not fully offset the higher cost of products during the period.", "We also had an impact of promotional discounts. The type, magnitude, and timing of our promotional activities that are recorded as a reduction to sales also contributed to the fluctuation in gross margin period-to-period, negatively impacting the gross profit by 0.7% in Q1. A greater percentage of sales in Q1 were subject to promotional allowances due to the shift in promotional activity this quarter versus last year.", "That completes the gross margin discussion, now on to operating expenses, beginning with our selling, general, and administrative expenses. Our SG&A for the first quarter decreased by $100,000, or less than 1%, to a total of $21.1 million. With higher net sales, SG&A decreased from 26.8% of sales in Q1 last year to 25.3% this year. The decrease in SG&A was largely attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation and lower freight costs, which offset other increases in costs.", "Our foreign currency translation decreased the SG&A expense by $1.3 million for the first quarter. SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2009 translated at the exchange rate that affected Q1 last year would have produced a total SG&A expense of $22.4 million versus the $21.1 million.", "Lower freight costs of $800,000 resulted from improved shipping efficiencies as well as lower fuel costs. The positive impact from the foreign exchange rates benefit, as well as the freight, offset increases in people-related and other costs. ", "Some of these include employee expenses, which were up $800,000 due to the annual compensation increases as well as higher staffing levels, primarily to support the growth of our international operations.", "We had higher professional services expense up $500,000 primarily in the legal area. We had higher research and development costs of another $300,000 over the prior period due to the timing of new product development activity and additional miscellaneous expenses including stock option compensation and some bad debt added another $400,000 over the prior year.", "Advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased to $5.4 million in the first quarter from $6.6 million in Q1 last year and as a percentage of sales, fell to 6.5% in the first quarter from 8.4% in Q1 last year. The decrease in the current period is related to the timing of investment in advertising activities, primarily a 1001 TV campaign in Europe, which was not repeated during this fiscal year. We still expect investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal 2009 to be in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% of sales.", "Amortization of intangible assets of $100,000 is related to customer lists acquired in the 1001 acquisition completed in fiscal 2004.", "Our operating income for the quarter was $12.1 million, or 14.4% of sales, compared to $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales in Q1 last year.", "Our net interest expense for the quarter was $0.4 million, virtually flat to Q1 last year. While the expense was nearly the same as the prior year, both interest expense and interest income were lower in the current year. Interest expense was lower due to the reduced principal balance of our long-term debt while interest income was lower due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in the current quarter compared to last year.", "The provision from income tax was 35.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase from 33.4% in the first quarter of last year. The increase in tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in the tax rate benefits associated with municipal bond interests as well as some increase in state tax rates.", "Net income for the quarter was $7.7 million, up 23.4% from Q1 last year. Foreign currency exchange rates period-over-period had a $0.9 million impact on net income as fiscal 2009 results translated at last year\u2019s exchange rates would have produced net income of $8.6 million.", "On a diluted basis earnings per share were $0.46 compared to $0.36 in Q1 last year. Diluted shares outstanding have decreased to 16.7 million compared to 17.1 million for the first quarter last year. This is a result of share repurchases during Q2 of last year of over 0.5 million shares.", "On December 9 the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share payable on January 30, 2009, to shareholders of record on January 8, 2009. And based on today\u2019s closing price of $26.79, the annualized yield would be 3.6%.", "Now on to the balance sheet as of November 30, 2008.", "Cash was $26.3 million, down from $42.0 million at the end of fiscal 2008 primarily due to our annual $10.7 million principal payment on our long-term borrowings, which was paid in October 2008. We have dividend payments of $4.1 million in October and we had some capital expenditures of $1.2 million during the period.", "Our accounts receivable decreased to $46.4 million, down $2.9 million versus August 31 as a result of the timing of sales.", "Our inventory increased from $18.3 million to $20.3 million since the end of last year. The increase is primarily due to raw material and components to support new sourcing initiatives, as well as the build-up in inventory in Europe ahead of some anticipated future cost increases.", "Current liabilities at November 30, 2008, were $51.6 million, down from $54.6 million at the end of the fiscal year.", "Accounts payable on accrued liabilities decreased by $4.3 million due to the timing of payments. Our accrued payroll and related expenses were down $1.2 million primarily due to a payment of the fiscal year 2008 bonuses, which was paid in October 2008.", "Income tax payables decreased $2.6 million primarily due to the timing of income tax payments.", "We continue to de-lever the company and in October we made our $10.7 million annual principal payment. As of November 30, 2008, our outstanding balance under our original $75.0 million term loan was $32.1 million.", "Maintaining liquidity in these uncertain times continues to be a priority for U.S. we believe that our existing cash, the liquidity available on our undrawn $10.0 million line of credit, as well as our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet projected operating and capital requirements for our current business plans.", "In this time of economic turmoil and uncertainty we were pleased that our company has such a strong balance sheet and a solid financial foundation. ", "And that\u2019s really it for the financial update. Again, for more information, we will have available our 10-K which will be filed later this week.", "Thanks, and back to Garry Ridge.", "Garry O. Ridge", "We continue to operate in turbulent times with high volatility and raw material costs which has an impact on our cost of goods, slowing economies that challenge our top line, as well as sharp changes in foreign currency exchange rates that significantly impact sales and profits from our international segments.", "These factors make our job more difficult to anticipate how the business will fare for the fiscal year. Because of this we have decided not to issue our annual four-year outlook document, normally issued during the first quarter of the reporting period.", "Please note that any forward-looking goals we have released in the past on that document are now obsolete.", "We are all well aware, however, that our investment community appreciates as much visibility as possible relating to our business and we want to give you as much visibility as possible. That is why we are now providing you with our current outlook for Q2 and an updated guidance for the fiscal year.", "As you have heard me say often, we do not run our business on a short-term quarter-to-quarter basis nor generally guide on a quarterly basis but feel it is appropriate given the volatility we have seen and are experiencing.", "The following guidance does not include any acquisition although we continue to actively seek opportunities that are the right fit at the right price and the right business case.", "For the second quarter we expect our net sales to be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates with results in the range of sales of $69.0 million to $73.0 million. Actual net sales in Q2 of last fiscal year was $78.9 million, however would have been $70.9 million at the current year foreign exchange rates, thus our expected reduction in net sales in Q2 versus last year is due largely to the foreign currency exchange impact.", "We expect our investment in global advertising and promotion in Q2 to be about the annual range of 6.5% and 8.5% of net sales.", "We expect our net income to be in the range of $3.8 million to $4.6 million, which would achieve an earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.28, assuming 16.6 million shares outstanding. Note, the key drivers of the difference of Q2 this year versus last year are mostly higher promotional discounts and advertising investment, an impact of $4.1 million, or $0.16 per share, on an after-tax basis, and foreign currency exchange impact of $1.4 million, or $0.08 per share.", "If foreign currency exchange rates remain at current levels we will continue to see a significant negative impact on our sales and net income for the balance of the year.", "As for the full fiscal year of 2009 we are updating our guidance as follows:", "Despite positive sales growth in local currencies, we expect our net sales to be in the range of $305.0 million to $315.0 million. Our forecasted sales at last year\u2019s foreign currency exchange rates would have produced net sales of between $338.0 million and $349.0 million, or a growth of 6.6% to 10.1% over fiscal year 2008.", "We expect our advertising and promotional investment to range between 6.5% and 8.5% of net sales for the fiscal year but to be at or above the high end of that range through Q2 and Q3.

We will also continue to our transparency philosophy, keeping our shareholders informed as we weather the challenges ahead of us.", "We would be pleased to open for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "You talk about the price impact of 3.3% of the gross margin. What was the price benefit to the sales line?", "Jay Rembolt", "We really didn\u2019t give that number but you can back into it.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "So when you say 3.3% to gross profit, that means like the margin benefited by 330 basis points due to pricing?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "In terms of the WD-40 line, how much of the product line has been converted to a Smart Straw in the U.S. at this point? Like in very rough terms. Is it 1/3, is it \u00bd? Can you tell at all?", "Garry O. Ridge", "If you look at the total line of our total SKUs , there are only about four now that aren\u2019t Smart Straw, that won\u2019t convert because the Smart Straw is not appropriate to that. So I would think that it\u2019s a large percentage of our total SKU count is now in Smart Straw format.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Because the conversion has largely been completely, what do you believe that to what\u2019s the end of the year going into 2010, maybe some of the beneficial pricing, what level of pricing you have achieved, will it flatten out?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Yes, I think that now that most of all of the classic product has been flushed through the system that the majority of our customers in the retail segment and in the areas that are supplying doers and people who use our product on the job are now supplying Smart Straw through those trade channels. So it won\u2019t be much longer before most of the volume is in Smart Straw and then the volume, or the dollar volume, will level out.", "But we are very far through the whole process now. You will still find the classic product, of course, on the shelf at retail, as that continues to be flushed through the system. But in all cases, now we are shipping Smart Straw on the product where it is appropriate.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "An raw materials, how much existing raw materials were worked through this period, meaning it seems if I look at your costs and look at the raw material cost increases, it seems that there must have been some higher cost inventory that is still working its way through income statements. And all things being equal, things should look more favorable for the next two or three quarters, I would think.", "Jay Rembolt", "Well, with respect to the oil-based products, in the oil-based components, we are seeing that. Again, we are going to see a fairly significant increase in the cost of our steel-based, or tin plate-based, cans, our aerosol cans. So there will be an offset. But generally, we would expect to see an improvement in our margin.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "So on a net basis, even though aerosol can prices may still go up, you think on a net basis raw material costs should improve going forward.", "Garry O. Ridge", "What we would see is that if oil prices kind of stay down where they are and now that we know what our price increase in cans is, it\u2019s in the range that we shared at the last call of around 48% to 50%, if oil stays down and we get the conversion, given that and the savings that we anticipate from the improved manufacturing process from the capital equipment we\u2019ve invested on our packages lines to improve the line speed from Smart Straw, all of those things aligned, we should see some sort of at least stabilization and improvement in our gross margin, particularly in the second quarter. ", "I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen in the third quarter yet, because it\u2019s just too volatile. But those stars aligned, then we would see a positive trend in gross margin.", "Silka Koopf for Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Have you discussed, and in rough terms, how much of an expense how much aerosol can costs are in terms of cost of goods sold?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No, but in our Investor Presentation that\u2019s on our website, there is a slide in there now where we break up the percentage costs of the major components of an aerosol can. I don\u2019t have it in front of me or otherwise I would share it with you but it is in our Investor Presentation where it splits out how much is steel, how much is oil, how much is cardboard, how much is filling.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets.", "Alan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets", "My question concerns your guidance. If you back out your second quarter forecast from your full year guidance there seems to be a major disconnect between what you are seeing in the current quarter and what you expect in the second half. It looks like your current EPS guidance is predicated on operating margins in the high single digits but to get to the full year projections that operating margin needs to expand to the high teens for the second half. So I guess my question is am I reading that correctly and if so, why do you think that the second half is going to be so different from the second quarter?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Absolutely you are reading it correctly and I don\u2019t know whether you were on when I shared it but the second quarter has a substantially higher marketing spend. I think it\u2019s about equal to $0.17 per share. We have said that our Q2 and Q3 advertising and sales promotional activities will be above, or at least at the high end of our guidance, which is 8.5%. So we have strategically executed some high marketing activity to hopefully get some extra promotional space in stores while other people are going underground. So that\u2019s basically the main reason that you will see that, and we also, we gained a little bit extra in the first quarter. We guided 40 to 45, we came in at 46 so we had a little better in the first quarter. This is what we see in Q2 and then Q3 we would expect high sales levels at a slightly reduced advertising spend than Q2 and then we would expect to ride home with it in Q4 where obviously you are going to see our advertising and promotional expense drop below those two highs to be able to come in within our range.", "Alan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets", "That makes sense. But also, it seems that in the second half you are assuming a significant hike in gross margins as well. Am I reading that correctly? Or is the promotional spend part of that?", "Garry O. Ridge", "The promotional spend is part of that. We don\u2019t guide on gross margin but we have said that if we finish the year at or above where we started we think we will have done a good job.", "Alan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets", "With this Spot Shot conversion to the non-toxic product, do you expect any incremental costs due to this conversion, in a similar manner to the cost we saw due to the Smart Straw conversion?", "Garry O. Ridge", "We\u2019ve already taken those.", "Alan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets", "If you look at second quarter cash flow, do you have any plans to monetize your working capital to tide you over the slower market conditions this quarter?", "Jay Rembolt", "We monitor that fairly closely and I think as we look forward we certainly have adequate supplies in our working capital, as well as availability in borrowings, if needed.", "Alan Robinson - RBC Capital Markets", "Did you anticipate being cash flow positive in the current second quarter?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Going back to the guidance, on the top line in particular, you mentioned the $69.0 million to $73.0 million, which is down pretty significantly year-over-year, although most of that sounds like it\u2019s foreign exchange, and so if I back into what you\u2019re assuming in Europe, because I would imagine your foreign exchange impact in the Americas is pretty minimal, so if we assume some growth there and some small decline in Asia/Pacific, it seems like it implies a 20% to 30% decline in Europe on a reported basis. is that fair to say?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I don\u2019t know the exact percentage but certainly your theory is right. We are anticipating continued growth in local currencies in our European business. We anticipate continued growth in local currencies in Australia and in Canadian businesses. That\u2019s where we get the exchange rate hit. So if you look at our sales line, locally we anticipate we will continue to see some sales growth in the second quarter. Globally, in local currencies just about everywhere, we will see sales growth in the second quarter and through the year. The real hit is that, if you will, full year aggregate impact on sales of about $30.0 million if the U.S. dollar stays at where it is now.", "The guidance we have given has a baseline that the U.S. dollar, particularly to the pound, is going to stay where it is now, which is the $1.45 to $1.50 range, which is down from $2.00 at this time last year.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.", "I recall you are much more pound-centric than Euro-centric.", "Garry O. Ridge", "It\u2019s all pound. It\u2019s the pound to the dollar is where we are taking it in the shorts.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.", "In terms of your strategy on the home care side, I mean, obviously that has been struggling for a while and that continues there. It doesn\u2019t seem like there is an easy fix. Is there a possibility you could divest some of those businesses or shut them down?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I have said publicly it\u2019s our goal to reduce the dependency we have on the volatility of the grocery trade channel. At this time, and when we enter the future, all of the products in our household products are contributing handsomely to our EBITDA line and we will continue to maximize that contribution. If sales drop, we certainly are not going to be making significant long-term investments but we certainly will harvest those as long as we need to, and then through brand extension, other acquisition, innovation, global expansion, over time it is our stated strategic objective to reduce our dependence on the volatile grocery trade channel.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Are you contemplating any additional price increases beyond what you took in October, on the WD-40 brand in particular?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No. As you can imagine we are getting an interesting piece of feedback from our customer base because they\u2019re seeing oil drop from $150 to $50 and now they are asking us for price decreases. Also, the common talk in the market is still prices are coming down and we\u2019re saying they\u2019re going up. So our credibility is being challenged on a daily basis and it\u2019s an uphill battle to be showing people that this is real. So we are going to sit tight now and just see where it settles down.", "However, having said that, let me say this, that we are much more proactive on our movement of pricing now than we ever have been in the past, given the turbulence that we have been going through.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co.", "When you say proactive, you mean you are much quicker to take pricing than you were?", "Garry O. Ridge", "We consider it more often now than we ever have before.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "It looks like with the economic headwinds you have got a lot of push back on your promotional work. If I\u2019m looking at your advertising and promotion budget for the year, how are you allocating it between lubricant and household products?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I was hoping someone would ask that question. Our major pushes are firstly, WD-40 industrial and consumer print in support of our Smart Straw alternative. We have just finished the Smart Straw tour and we are turning up the volume on making our core end users and our heavy end users in the industrial and the heavy doer section very, very aware of Smart Straw and activities to build promotion and display of Smart Straw, basically to restock America.", "We see that the opportunity now is to restock the homes of America with Smart Straw now that we have full production and we\u2019re going gang busters at that.", "The second major advertising promotion push is on Spot Shot. Spot Shot, as you know, is a large revenue generator. It\u2019s a product with good gross margin and that\u2019s all around the year-long promotion based on Marley and Me. ", "And the third area is we\u2019re having a one-time push based around the Super Bowl with 2000 Flushes in the second quarter. ", "So, we\u2019re really focusing in three areas, WD-40, Spot Shot, and 2000 Flushes, all good sized businesses with good margins. And then a lot of our promotional activity, also, is to generate display, and of course, in other parts of the world, to generate new distribution, to find new users in new markets, sampling activities in China and Russia, display building activities in German and France and Spain, display building activities in the U.K.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "If I go back to households, it looks like Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes, which had pretty tough first quarters, are two categories that you are going to invest in throughout the year.", "Garry O. Ridge", "2000 Flushes in Q2 and Spot Shot through the year with a very, very positive promotion that we have linked with Marley and Me. And it\u2019s getting a lot of good traction. As you know, if you\u2019ve seen the movie, Marley and Me is a dog that makes messes everywhere and Spot Shot is his friend.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "In the past, if I go back to past performances, your cash flows for the balance of the year will be pretty strong and your cash balance will be growing as we get through the end of fiscal 2009. Are acquisitions a priority or do buybacks fall into the mix anywhere along there?", "Jay Rembolt", "We evaluate that on a regular basis, depending on the circumstances. I think as we look forward, I think we do see acquisitions as a way to use our cash.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Frank Magdlen - The Robins Group.", "Frank Magdlen - The Robins Group", "When you look at the household area, is there a big shift in going away from aerosol cans?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No, not necessarily. The only products we have in aerosol cans is Carpet Fresh and one SKU of Spot Shot. There was some movement in some of the Spot Shot area with the aerosol. But, no, it\u2019s not necessarily a major trend. We did see a little bit of it but it\u2019s not a bias to that.", "Frank Magdlen - The Robins Group", "So it isn\u2019t the consumer saying no, they still want the convenience, as opposed to a trigger.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Correct. There are two very distinct camps. There is a trigger user and there is an aerosol user. But unilaterally, globally, consumers still see the aerosol delivery system as a convenient, safe, tamper-proof form of product delivery.", "Frank Magdlen - The Robins Group", "Are you willing to give us about what percent of your sales are through aerosol?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No. But thanks for asking.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thank you for joining us. I just want to end with a comment on a song that I heard the other day. There is a country and western song and my son actually put it on a DVD for me for Christmas, but there is one line in it that I think really is good for us, and the line says, \u201cI hear there\u2019s trouble in the neighborhood, but I think we\u2019re doing all right.\u201d", "Thanks for being with us today and we look forward to talking to you at the next conference call.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time I would like to turn the call over the Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations for the WD-40 Company, Ms Maria Mitchell.", "Maria Mitchell", "Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call for fiscal 2009. Today we\u2019re pleased to have Garry Ridge, President and CEO and Jay Rembolt, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company\u2019s outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results. These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company.", "Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements including the impact of commodity prices, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, impacts of new products and brands and the uncertainty in economic conditions both in the United States and internationally.", "The company\u2019s expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and believed by the company to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or accomplished. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports by WD-40 Company with the SEC including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, 10-K and readers are urged to carefully review these and other documents and stay up to date with our most recent company developments provided in the investor relations section of our website at www.WD-40company.com.", "Our annual shareholder meeting will be held on December 8, 2009 at 2:00 pm at the University of San Diego. A note to our shareholders; we will be using the noted and access method to deliver our proxy materials this year. You will be getting a notice in the mail to help you access your electronic materials and instructions on proxy voting. Our first quarter fiscal 2010 earnings conference call is scheduled to take place on Monday, January 11, 2010 at 2:00 pm. ", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Garry Ridge.", "Garry Ridge", "Good day and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. This has been a turbulent and rough year but one with many successes. Unfavorable significant shifts in foreign currency exchange rates greatly impacted our results and excluding that impact, both our sales and income grew versus the prior year.", "The global recession hit us hard particularly in Q2, but we did see the trend reverse in Q3 with further growth in the fourth quarter. We experienced volatility in our raw material costs, yet managed the business to significantly improve the gross margin to exceed our goal of 50% in the back half of the year.", "We took a $6.7 million in impairment charges related to our home care and cleaning brands which was partially a result of our practice multi-purpose maintenance products. However, that shift in focus has positioned us well going forward which I\u2019ll expand on in a moment.", "A rough year, absolutely. Down and out, absolutely not. Not only have we been surviving but we spent fiscal year 2009 positioning ourselves for growth in the future. First, we refined our strategy to focus on multi-purpose maintenance products, the sand box as we call it where we have the right to win. The strategy alignment includes new product development, acquisition criteria, WD-40 brand exploration and strategic marketing initiatives.", "Second, we developed the WD-40 D&A signature to use on selected products to further leverage the trust and credibility of the WD-40 brand. Thirdly, we developed Blue Works, an entirely new brand and product line of superior industrial grade multi-purpose maintenance products. Fourth, we increased our distribution of recent renovations including two new products under the 3-IN-ONE brand, the 3-IN-ONE no rush shield and the 3-IN-ONE professional garage door lube.", "The bottom line is, while there were many unfavorable forces out of our control, we rose to the challenge and managed the business to minimize the impact of those forces on our results. We decided there was no reason to waste a good crisis. Furthermore, our initiatives put our business on the path to growth despite a prolonged period of turmoil and uncertainty.", "With that said, let\u2019s move on to our quarter and annual results. We reported net sales of $77.8 million for the fourth quarter fiscal 2009, an increase of 1% versus the fourth quarter last year, and year to date net sales were $292 million, a decrease of 8% versus year 2008. Net income for the fourth quarter was $7.6 million, up 64% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Year to date net income was $26.3 million, down 5% versus fiscal 2008. ", "Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.46 compared to $0.28 for the same period last year. Year to date earnings per share were $1.58 down from $1.64 last year.", "Let\u2019s cover in more detail the significant impact on our business and Q4 results starting with foreign currency exchange rates. We have seen local currencies fall in value relative to the U.S. dollar across several markets. The stronger U.S. dollar impacted us in three ways; first in converting sales and profits from our international segments, second in causing price fluctuations on our products to our customers and consumers in some international markets and third, by impacting the cost of our U.S. source products to our international segments.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorable to our results in both Q4 and year to date. Current Q4 results translated at last year\u2019s fourth quarter exchange rates or what we term as constant currency basis, would have produced net sales of $82.4 million and net income of $8.7 million.", "Thus, on a constant currency basis, Q4 net sales would have increased 9% versus 1% and net income would have been up 85% versus 64%. Constant currency basis is the translation of our current period results from the functional currencies of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollars utilizing the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year period.", "Year to date impact of foreign currency fluctuations was significant. Results on a constant currency basis would have produced net sales of $321.9 million and net income of $30.8 million compared with year to date last year net sales would have increased 2% versus a decline of 8%, and net income would have increased 12% rather than a decline of 5%.", "In those international markets where we sell our goods in U.S. dollars, the change in foreign currency exchange rates effectively created price rises at local levels and in some cases in excess of 20% to 30%. Exchange rates also impacted the cost of U.S. sourced product to our international segments and negatively impacted our gross margin this fiscal year. ", "We are working on alternative strategies to minimize the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on the price of products in local markets. For instance, we recently began manufacturing Smart Straw in Europe which had been exclusively sourced in the U.S. prior. ", "Another significant impact was the global economy. In the first half of the year we saw customers tighten up on inventory and consequently reduce volume in response to the economic uncertainty. We saw the tide begin to turn in the third quarter with further improvement in customer sentiment in the fourth quarter. ", "Sales increased 11% in Q3 over Q2 and Q4 increased 13% over Q3. Fourth quarter net sales of $77.8 million represented a 26% increase over the second quarter sales of $61.8 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had little impact on sales over the last two quarters.", "Another significant impact was the expected year over year decline in our home care and cleaning products. Global sales of this product group declined 18% versus last fiscal year as a result of lost distribution, competitive factors and the challenges due to adverse economic conditions. This product group has shown signs of stabilization with much smaller declines of 3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 versus the same period last year.", "Home care and cleaning products also impacted our profitability in the short term due to impairment charges of $3.9 million in Q4 relating to our Carpet Fresh and X-14 brands with a total impairment charge of $6.7 million related to these brands for the fiscal year. These non cash impairment charges were related to the change to de-finited lived assets for Carpet Fresh and X-14 brands which were triggered by declines in profit margins and forecast sales revenue of the brands.", "The lower profit margins primarily stem from the significant can cost increase we incurred while the lower sales revenue forecasts were attributed to less distribution in the U.S. and our strategic decision to divert our research and development resources from our home care and cleaning products to our multi-purpose maintenance products and adjacent categories.", "We believe this shift in investment and time, talent and treasure to our multi-purpose maintenance products and adjacent categories will reward our shareholders in the long term. We are currently launching a new line of industrial grade, multi-purpose maintenance products under the new brand name of Blue Works. I will give you more details on this fantastic product line later in the call when we discuss our fiscal 2010 outlook.", "A positive impact on our results was the improvement in gross margin percentages. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2007, our gross margin averaged 49.8% of net sales. Then volatility and sharp increases in raw material costs eroded our margin percentage down to 46.8% in 2008. We addressed the challenges by implementing several strategies to compact these impacts which helped to improve our gross margin percentage to 51.6% in Q4 and 49.5% for fiscal 2009.", "Price increases were needed to cover the sharp rise in raw material costs, yet they were implemented carefully to respect the relationship with our customers and consumers. We continue to look at our business and launch initiatives to improve the quality, service, price and value of our products to ultimately improve our gross margin.", "These initiatives included supply chain improvements and product conversions, many of which stem from the work of our cost reduction and containment theme, or as we call them, the crack team. Supply chain improvements have included investments in capital equipment to reduce manufacturing costs and improve quality.", "Restructure and consolidation of raw materials sourcing, contracting with alternative manufacturers and service providers where necessary, improving warehouse and distribution operations and costs of repackaging and redesigning displays to reduce cost while maintaining quality. Product conversions were done on all our top three brands, WD-40, Smart Straw and 2000 Flushes.", "The conversions involved some change in formulation and/or delivery systems that improved the product and added value to the consumer as well as enhancing our gross margin.", "These initiatives required up front investment and expenses that initially impacted the gross margin. We began to see the changes pay off for us in Q3, adding 100 basis points to the gross margin percentage and Q4 which had added 50 basis points for the fiscal year.", "These figures exclude the lower petroleum based material costs in Q3 and Q4 stemming from both lower oil prices and sourcing changes. The lower petroleum cost based materials helped us to offset the can increases we incurred earlier in the calendar year. We have been very pleased with the cost benefits we are seeing with the consolidation, restructuring and other changes our team has implemented for the petroleum based materials.", "I hope I have been able to give you an additional perspective on the company\u2019s overall performance. Now let\u2019s talk about sales. Sales results in fiscal 2009 versus 2008 by product lines were as follows: multi-purpose maintenance products sales were up 3% globally in the fourth quarter and up 12% in constant currency. Year to date sales were down 5% yet up 6% in constant currency.", "In the America\u2019s the product group was up 7% in the fourth quarter and up 3% year to date. Europe multi-purpose maintenance sales were up 1% in the fourth quarter and down 12% year to date. Yet in constant currency, Europe sales were up 23% in the fourth quarter and up 12% year to date.", "Asia Pacific multi-purpose maintenance products sales declined 10% in the fourth quarter and 12% year to date due to the continued impact of weakening economies and unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations in that area.", "Home care and cleaning product sales were down 3% globally in the fourth quarter, up 18% year to date. Smart Shop grew in the fourth quarter by 6% and was down 9% for the year. Smart Shop was the strongest performing household brand in Q4 and year to date attributed in part to the comprehensive campaign built around the Molly and Me film.", "The campaign has included commercial advertising on TV and movie theaters, discounts and free with promotions and with the movie and DVD release, ads in magazines and special in-store displays. We expect the brand to further benefit from a similar program launched around the film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which was the number one film in the first two weeks of release.", "Home care and cleaning products in the U.S. were impacted by lost distribution, competitive activities and the overall economic slowdown. Home care and cleaning products fared better in our international markets yet were negatively impacted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Europe\u2019s results at actual exchange rates resulted in declines of 4% in Q4 and 12% year to date, yet in constant currency the product group was up 16% and 11% respectively.", "Australia\u2019s home care and cleaning products at actual exchange rates resulted in declines of 20% in Q4 and 16% year to date, and in constant currency the product group was down 5% in Q4 and 5% year to date.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our results by trading block. The America\u2019s trading block segment increased from 56% of global sales in Q4 of last fiscal year to 57% of global sales in the current fourth quarter. Net sales in the America\u2019s increased by 4% in Q4 and declined 5% year to date. On a constant currency basis, sales increased by 5% in Q4 and decreased by 4% year to date.", "America\u2019s multi-purpose maintenance products were up 7% in Q4 and 3% year to date. Home and cleaning products experienced declines of 2% in Q4 and year to date declined 19% due to many competitive and economic challenges that we shared earlier.", "U.S. sales were up 3% in Q4 and down 5% year to date. Multi-purpose maintenance products in the U.S. were up 5$ in Q4 and up 4% year to date, and home care and cleaning products were flat in Q4 and down 18% year to date.", "Our Latin America business which is primarily multi-purpose maintenance products, total sales were up 57% in Q4 and 6% year to date. These sales increases was due to price increases, promotional activities and increased distribution to new customers.", "Canada sales both multi-purpose maintenance products and home care and cleaning products, Canada net sales decreased 19% in Q4 and 16% year to date. In constant currency Canada sales were down 10% in Q4 and down 3% year to date with the dips due to declines in the home care and cleaning product segment.", "Now over to Europe which accounted for 34% of global sales in the fourth quarter in both fiscal years 2009 and 2008. Total European sales in U.S. dollars were flat in Q4 and declined 12% year to date in actual exchange rates. In constant currency rates, Europe\u2019s sales increased 22% in Q4 and 12% year to date.", "The pound Sterling is the functional currency of our European results and when we speak to the results in constant currency, they are based on holding steady the foreign exchange relationship of our Pound the to the U.S. dollar.", "Performance varied across countries in their respective currencies. The European trading block did benefit from the conversion of sales in local currencies to the Pound Sterling, yet ultimately were negatively impacted by the sharp decline in the exchange rate between the Pound Sterling and the U.S. dollar. Most of Europe experienced sales declines at actual Q4 exchange rates yet showed positive growth on a constant currency basis. ", "The following are the results across our European market on a constant currency basis. The U.K. increased 19% in Q4, 11% year to date. The direct markets which include France, Germany, Iberia, Italy grew 28% in Q4 and 13% year to date, and the distributor markets which include Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, the Middle East, grew 9% in Q4 and 8% year to date.", "Now Asia Pacific which accounted for 9% of the total sales in both Q4 and year to date, the Asia Pacific region which includes Asia and Australia experienced a sales decrease of 12% in both Q4 and year to date compared to last fiscal year. On a constant currency basis, sales decreased 6% in Q4 and 5% year to date.", "The declines in Asia Pacific are primarily due to China and the Asian marketing distributors. China\u2019s sales decreased 28% in Q4 and 17% year to date and the Asian distributors, 8% in Q4, 9% year to date. These decreases were primarily due to the slower economic environment which began to impact sales during the first quarter.", "Sales in Australia decreased 5% in U.S. dollar in Q4 and 14% year to date, yet on a constant currency basis grew 13% in Q4 and 7% year to date. The growth in constant currency was the result of price increases implemented during Q1, increased promotional activity and new distribution across all trade channels.", "That\u2019s it for the sales update. I need to take a breather, so I\u2019m going to pass it over to Jay Rembolt, my Chief Financial Officer who will continue with the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "In addition to the information presented on this call, we will suggest that you review the 10-K which we\u2019ll file next week.", "Our fourth quarter results, our gross margin increased to 51.6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to the 44.8% of sales in the same period last year. The increase in margin was primarily attributable to price increases, lower discounts, lower petroleum based costs. Gross margin also benefited from cost reductions resulting from sourcing changes and product conversions.", "These positive impacts were offset by some higher costs of aerosol cans, foreign exchange impact and some sales mix changes.", "Regarding the price increases, we implemented them in Q1 and Q2 of fiscal \u201909 and that added approximately 480 basis points to our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter. The price increase was primarily across our multi-purpose maintenance lines although we did have some implementing for our home care and cleaning products in the U.K.", "Our promotional discounts during the quarter, we had a lower percentage of our sales were subject to trade promotional allowances than in the prior year. As a result of these lower advertising, promotional discounts, our gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter.", "Promotional discounts are certain A&P costs such as customer rebates, display allowances, slotting, coupon, that are treated as a reduction in sales.", "Cost of products, as we look at our input costs, we have lowered costs for petroleum based materials but that benefit was nearly offset by the higher cost for aerosol cans. Due to inventory cycles, the cost of our petroleum basis products in our Q4 costs of goods continued to be relatively low and positively impacted our gross margin by 450 basis points.", "This benefit was offset by the dramatic increase in the cost of our aerosol cans that took effect earlier this calendar year which in the U.S. alone had an increase exceeding 40%. These can increased negatively impact our Q4 margin by about 340 basis points.", "The pricing of our tin plate used in our cans is typically set annually and does not fluctuate with the movement in the price of steel in the spot market. However, with the downward pressure on prices over the last several months, we recently negotiated a small cost reduction on our U.S. sources aerosol cans.", "We expect the lower can cost to start flowing into our cost of goods sold in the second quarter of fiscal \u201910. We anticipate this benefit will be offset by the flow through of higher more recent costs for petroleum based products however.", "Other impacts to cost of goods including sourcing changes and product conversions, fluctuation in currency rates and sales mix. The sourcing changes and product conversions that Garry discussed earlier positively impacted our gross margin by 110 basis points and stemmed from new lower cost formulations associated with product conversions, investment in equipment to improve efficiency and cost of manufacturing our product, as well as lower cost from new manufacturers.", "In addition in this quarter, we did not have the up front costs associated with these changes as we did in Q4 of last year. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates related to the cost of products. In some of our international markets, a portion of the products that we sell are sourced in different currencies. ", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates period to period can cause fluctuations in our gross margin with respect to these products. In the fourth quarter these fluctuations had a negative impact on our margin by 50 basis points.", "Smart Straw is an example of a product with foreign currency exchange impact. Smart Straw had previously been manufactured in the U.S. and sold to various segments around the globe. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar from the prior year effectively increased the cost of Smart Straw to our international segments.", "As Garry mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve recently begun to manufacture and source Smart Straw in Europe which is the second largest market for the Smart Straw. ", "Sales mix and other miscellaneous items combined to negatively impact our margin by 40 basis points.", "On to operating expenses beginning with selling, general and administrative expenses, for the fourth quarter these expenses remained flat versus the prior period at $20.3 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A slightly decreased from 26.4% in Q4 of fiscal \u201908 to 26.1% in the current quarter. ", "Favorable impacts to our SG&A would include the impacts of currency exchange rates in Q4 compared to the prior year which decreased the expense by $1.6 million. We had savings on freight to customers decrease by another $.6 million due to lower fuel costs, increased shipping efficiencies as a result of some lower sales in the quarter.", "We also had some savings in a variety of other miscellaneous costs that amounted to $.3 million. These favorable impacts were offset by higher employee related costs which increased by $2 million primarily due to annual compensation increases and staff increases.", "Higher R&D costs for the quarter increased by $.4 million primarily due to the changes in the nature of and the timing of our new product development. Advertising sales and promotion expense decreased from $4.6 million to $4.1 million in the fourth quarter and decreased as a percent of sales from 6% to 5.3%. The lower level of investment is due to the timing of advertising activities as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.", "Amortization of intangible assets of $.1 million is related to customer lists acquired in the 1001 acquisition completed in 2004. Q4 results also included an impairment charge of $3.9 million related to the Carpet Fresh and the X-14 brand that Garry had mentioned earlier. ", "Operating income for the fourth quarter was $11.3 million compared to $7.6 million in Q4 last year. Net interest expense for Q4 was $.5 million, up slightly from the same period last year.", "Other income decreased by $.2 million during the quarter and that was due to foreign currency exchange losses compared to the prior quarter that experienced some foreign currency gains.", "Provision for income taxes decreased from 36.8% in Q4 of last year to 29% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the increase in percentage of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates as we ended the year. ", "Net income in Q4 was $7.6 million, an increase of 64% from the $4.7 million in Q4 last fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency rates period over period had an unfavorable impact on net income of $1.1 million. Q4 results on a constant currency basis would have produced net income of $8.7 million or 85% over Q4 last year.", "On a diluted per share basis, earnings were $0.46 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.28 in the same period last year. Diluted shares outstanding have increased slightly from 16.6 million shares in Q4 of last year to 16.7 million shares in the current quarter.", "Now we\u2019ll move on to our year to date results. Our year to date gross margin percentage grew 270 basis points at 49.5% of sales. The gross margin improvement is attributable to the same factors noted in our Q4 discussion. Price increases added approximately 70 basis points to gross margin and positive impacts from product conversions, sourcing changes added an additional 80 basis points.", "Our cost of aerosol cans however, impacted our gross margin negatively 150 basis points, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a negative impact on our margin by 60 basis points, most of which is related to our European segment.", "A shift in sales mix from year to year had a negative impact on gross margin by another 40 basis points along with some close out transaction and other miscellaneous items which had another 40 basis point impact.", "The cost of petroleum based products had a neutral impact to gross margin year over year, whereas the cost of petroleum based products increased in fiscal 2008 and peaked in our Q4. The opposite occurred in 2009 as petroleum products in our cost of goods peaked in Q1 and gradually decreased in Q2 through Q4.", "As we look to our operating expenses, our SG&A year to date expenses decreased by $83.8 million to $78.1 million. As a percentage of sales increased slightly from 26.4% to 26.7%. The decrease in SG&A stems primarily from the changes in foreign currency rates compared to last year which had an impact of $7.8 million on the expense line as well as freight costs which decreased by $3.2 million due to lower sales, lower fuel costs and improved shipping efficiencies.", "Partially offsetting some of these decreases were employee related costs which includes salaries, profit sharing, fringe benefits, which increased $4.1 million primarily as a result of annual compensation increases and additional staffing needed during the year.", "Research and development costs increased $1.1 million primarily due to the timing of the new product development activities. Other miscellaneous expenses including stock based compensation, professional service fees, bad debt expense had a slight increase in total of about $.1 million.", "Advertising, sales and promotional expenses decreased slightly to $19.5 million and increased as a percentage of sales from 6.3% in 2008 to 6.7% in the current year. The slight decrease in the expenditure was due to the timing of investment activities as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which had a $1.7 million impact in the current year.", "Amortization of our intangible assets for the year was $.5 million related to the 1001 brand customer list. Year to date results also had a second quarter and a fourth quarter non cash impairment charge totaling $6.7 million related to the Carpet Fresh and X-14 brands.", "Operating income for fiscal 2009 was $33.9 million or 13.6% of net sales compared to $42.7 million or 13.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2008.", "Net interest expense for the year was $2.1 million, up $.4 million from fiscal 2008. Although we had lower interest expense from our lower debt, we also had lower interest income due to the lower interest rates in the current year. The lower interest income more than offset the benefit that we achieved from our lower interest expense.", "Other income decreased by $.4 million. The decrease versus the prior year was due to foreign currency exchange losses in the Europe segment in the current year.", "The provision for income taxes decreased 34.2%, down to 31.4% in the current year primarily due to tax benefits from changes in California tax law realized in the second quarter. The lower tax rate was also attributable to a favorable mix of foreign income taxed at lower rates as well as the renewal of the Federal R&D credit.", "Year to date net income decreased 5% to $26.3 million compared to $27.6 million in the same period last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $4.5 million impact on net income. Fiscal 2009 results translated to U.S. dollars at the prior year exchange rates or on a constant currency basis would have produced net income of $30.8 million or 12% above our 2008 figures.", "On a diluted share basis, earnings were $1.58 in fiscal 2009 compared to $1.64 in fiscal 2008. Our diluted shares outstanding have decreased to 16.7 million in the current year compared to the 16.8 million that we had throughout the full fiscal year of \u201908.", "Regarding the dividend, on October 2, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on October 30, 2009 to shareholders of record on October 16, 2009. Based on our closing price today of 31.8, the annualized dividend yield would be 3.1%.", "About our balance sheet at August 31, 2009, cash at $46 million was up from the $42 million at the end of fiscal \u201908. Cash provided by operating activities was $34.6 million. We had issuance of some common stock upon the exercises of stock options which provided an additional cash proceeds of $1.3 million.", "These cash inflows were partially offset by our $10.7 million annual principal payment as well as $16.5 million of dividends, and we had approximately $3 million of cash used for capital expenditures during the period.", "We continue to de-lever the company with our annual $10.7 million principal payment. As of August 31, our outstanding balance on our original $75 million loan was $32.1 million.", "Generating consistent cash flow and dividends to our shareholders as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet continue to be priorities for us. We believe that our existing cash and liquidity available for undrawn $10 million line of credit and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the projected operating capital requirements for our business in the near future.", "Again, more information will be available on our 10-K. Please take an opportunity to look at that next week. ", "Thanks so much, and now I\u2019ll turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Now let\u2019s discuss our outlook for guidance for fiscal 2010. We see sales growth for ourselves in light of the improving economic conditions and the initiatives we have been working on as part of our strategic vision including the launch of our Blue Works product.", "We anticipate the growth to flow through to net income if raw material costs maintain at recent levels. The following fiscal year 2009 guidance does not include any acquisition activities and assumes foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to fiscal year 2009 levels.", "We expect our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $298 million to $380 million, a growth of between 2.2% and 8.9% versus fiscal 2009. We expect our global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 6.5% and 8% of net sales. We expect net income to be between $30.2 million and $32.8 million which would achieve EPS or earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.95 assuming 16.8 million shares outstanding.", "So before I leave you today I\u2019d like to share a quote with you from our sixteenth U.S. President, Abraham Lincoln. \u201cThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew.\u201d", "Finally, DW-40 Company has two significant assets; product and people. To all our tribe members, the folks in the United States, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, the U.K., Scotland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Canada, China, Australia and Malaysia, a special thank you as you carried the day in this challenging year. You never gave up. You resisted panic for a belief that we all have something significant yet to do. A really big good on you mates to all of you.", "Thank you very much for joining us today. We\u2019ll be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Garry, Southeast Asia, Asia Pacific rather was down both in the quarter and the year. If I took out, how did China do within those results?", "Garry Ridge", "China had a tough year. It started just before the Chinese New Year last year when manufacturing went down. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any way a long term issue. We\u2019ve seen China start to come back again now, so overall we grew the year before 65% or something there about so it was a big comp to come round in this condition. So I\u2019m comfortable with where we are and I think we\u2019ll start to see China circle round.", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "On Blue Works, is the performance or the sales, do you expect to be more of a second half event or would you see something sooner, earlier in 2010.", "Garry Ridge", "We don\u2019t start to ship until November, early December, so there\u2019s virtually nothing in this first quarter.", "Liam Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Jay, I know with a lot of activities overseas, the tax rate tends to jump around. Is there any tax rate that we can sort of estimate for 2010?", "Jay Rembolt", "As I look forward, I think we are looking and projecting at around 34.5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase.", "", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "", "The impairment charge of $3.95 million pre tax, what was that after tax? Did you pay any book taxes or were there book taxes allocated to that?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes. We got a full tax benefit for that. That is the book charge and net of our tax rate gets us to a net number less than that which we didn\u2019t break out separately.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking about, what that number is.", "Jay Rembolt", "We didn\u2019t break it out.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "So we don\u2019t know the after tax effect of the $3.95 million charge?", "Jay Rembolt", "We hadn\u2019t specifically broken it out, but it\u2019s easy math on our average tax rate.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "In your revenue projections for next year when you do your earnings guidance, what do you include for Blue Works?", "Garry Ridge", "There\u2019s not a lot. We don\u2019t ship Blue Works until late November, early December. So we don\u2019t see a big inflow of Blue Works revenues until certainly the back half of the year, so there\u2019s not a material amount of Blue Works certainly in the first half of the year, and we think it will be a slow build up. We\u2019ll know more as we start to ship in the first quarter. There\u2019s a little unknown there.", "We\u2019re getting very favorable responses from the end users and the customers but the real volume won\u2019t be known until we start to ship. At this time the guidance doesn\u2019t have a lot of Blue Works in it.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "What\u2019s the goal for the fourth quarter of next year? Do you want to be at $2 million quarterly run rate of $3 million? Is that the right order of magnitude or is the order of magnitude larger or smaller?", "Garry Ridge", "I honestly would not be doing justice to try and predict that because I will be materially wrong whatever number I give you. We\u2019ve identified Blue Works as being a great opportunity going forward. We won\u2019t know its run rate completely until we start to ship distribution and get our customers buying it.", "We intend to update the market every quarter and a step by step basis on how Blue Works is being accepted and what its success is looking like.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "Jay went through a nice discussion of all the puts and takes on gross margin and I think I probably muddled myself in listening to it. As I understood what you were saying, it sounded like price increase was the largest single factor behind the year over year gross margin improvement and that raw materials year over year hadn\u2019t appreciably changed. Is that true or have I muddled that?", "Jay Rembolt", "In some ways, the oil based materials year over year were about equivalent, so there was a minimal impact on an annual basis year over year of oil based materials. We did have a fairly significant increase in the cost of our cans which had an impact, a negative impact. So our input costs on an annual basis were not favorable to us.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "So it was prices that really determined the gross margin leverage in the quarter.", "Jay Rembolt", "We did have a significant impact from price increases in the fourth quarter, although in the fourth quarter which was different from the annual year, we did get benefit from lower oil based products. We got nearly 450 basis points from that I believe.", "Garry Ridge", "", "The other impact was the actually realizing the improvements that we\u2019ve made in the supply chain, particularly capital equipment that we put in place, our packages that reduced our cost because of increased line speeds. We benefited from re-formulations in products such as our 2000 flushes product. So really the reductions or the savings came from that area to the tune of about 110 basis points.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "Can you give me an idea of whether your volumes changes in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter last year?", "Garry Ridge", "Globally if you took it in U.S. dollars, you\u2019re talking volumes globally.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "Volume like the number of ounces sold. Did the number of ounces you sold change very much?", "Garry Ridge", "We never really discuss that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Jay could you clarify the cost reductions you\u2019ve negotiated on tin can costs. So I know normally you get a reset every January I guess in terms of your tin can input costs. So is it the case this time around that you just pre negotiated that price which will be in effect for 12 months. Is that right?", "Jay Rembolt", "We don\u2019t know that to be the case. What happened is that as we got near the middle of our year in the late summer, there had been a continued gap between the underlying cost of steel and tin plate, and there\u2019s a number of discussions and negotiations that suggested that price should come down.", "We had some acknowledgement from can manufacturers that they also felt that that price should come down. So as we continued having those discussions, we were finally able to achieve I think it was a 6% price reduction in the cost of cans that will be in effect throughout the remainder of our calendar year.", "I\u2019m not sure what the temperature is for our January price reset. That will be revisited on our first quarter call.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "You mentioned that this will take effect in the second fiscal quarter of yours but presumably it takes awhile for these cheaper goods to go through your inventory.", "Jay Rembolt", "That\u2019s exactly right.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Clearly you did very well on the gross margins this quarter, in the fourth quarter. You discussed your view of gross margins for the fourth quarter back on your last call in July where you stated you expect the margins to be somewhat close to what you saw in the second quarter, just below 50%. What changed your view for the fourth quarter where it\u2019s almost 52%?", "Jay Rembolt", "We were looking in July the third quarter margin, up over 50% and we projected that forward as opposed to the year to date third quarter margin which was still down below 50%. So we saw the margin holding above 50% for the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll apologize for that lack of clarity in communication.", "Garry Ridge", "The next question that you probably have and we see given what we know today, that we are going to be able to maintain the level of margin in that 50% range through the year as long as oil doesn\u2019t hit $140 a barrel and other things go south on us. But certainly there are a lot of embedded cost reductions in our system now that we\u2019re comfortable with particularly in some of the areas of production and our out sourcing program.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "It sounds like your production improvements really were perhaps a little bit better than you had expected. Is that fair?", "Garry Ridge", "", "We didn\u2019t get the full benefit of them until later in the year. And that may be hit by mix of sales too. For example the amount of Solvol we put in the new high speed lines, and certainly the more we sell there\u2019s a benefit there.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Looking at your home care line in Europe, it looks like it\u2019s doing just fine on a constant currency basis. How do you view your competitive situation there in Europe in terms of home care over the next year or two? Are you starting to see some of the larger multi-national home care competitions increase their investments and promotion there?", "Garry Ridge", "The answer is yet, but I think in the category we\u2019re in over there, which is a little different from here, we have a very strong brand in 1001 that dominates in one particular segment over there which is basically the carpet care and cleaning segment. We are a much stronger brand in that segment than we were in the U.S. where we had one or two products in a segment.", "So I think we\u2019re reasonably comfortable that we\u2019ve got a good robust brand in 1001 and should see that continue as long as we continue our level of investment and our product development for that brand in the U.K. which we intend to do.", "Alan Robinson \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Are you shipping Blue Works globally next year or is it just domestically?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019ll start in the U.S. in November/December and we believe that come the mid year you will start to see it move definitely into Europe and probably into Asia later in the year. But we have some learning still to do, but there is a lot of activity going on now in determining marketing opportunities is Europe and Asia, particularly given the formulations are all complete.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Henry Caplan \u2013 Oppenheimer]", "[Henry Caplan \u2013 Oppenheimer]", "I was surprised to hear you say that there was a lower level of promotional activity in the quarter given that a number of companies recently talked about being more promotional. I was wondering why that was. Is there something in particular in your categories or retail partners that\u2019s driving that?", "Jay Rembolt", "It was primarily timing. If I look at some of the larger promotions that we have at customers, what I heard is there are few that slipped into the beginning of fiscal \u201910. So there\u2019s some of that.", "Garry Ridge", "But no decisive move to change. It was just the way the cards fell at the end of the year.", "[Henry Caplan \u2013 Oppenheimer]", "In terms of the advertising, the advertising expense was certainly lower than we had expected. Figure out if that was lower advertising because you sort of cut \u2026", "Garry Ridge", "Advertising comes in a lot of different shapes and forms. We don\u2019t do a lot of what people would call the traditional advertising that comes from lower rates on TV and whatever. But certainly we do use a number of different vehicles and it\u2019s a matter of timing and when we move them around that what we do at certain times that creates that. It was still within our range, maybe a little bit at the lower end of the range. \\", "[Henry Caplan \u2013 Oppenheimer]", "I wanted to gauge your sense about, talk about the acquisition in M&A environment. You\u2019re sitting on roughly $45 million of cash right now. I know you talked about de-leveraging the balance sheet. I wanted to see where M&A came into play if at all.", "Garry Ridge", "We continue within our sand box and where we have the right to win look for the opportunities. We\u2019ve looked at opportunities in the past year and quarter. Nothing has floated our boat yet, but we do have resource. We have talent that is assigned to that role particularly and we certainly have a very clear understanding of what we don\u2019t want.", "And therefore, we\u2019re busy trying to find what we do want at a price that we believe is value to our shareholders and something that we can return, get some good returns out of.", "[Henry Caplan \u2013 Oppenheimer]", "Would that likely skew towards the multi-purpose maintenance products or the home care and cleaning?", "Garry Ridge", "No. We have stated that we will be reducing the impact of the home care and cleaning products on our business over time and you would not find us making acquisitions in that space. If you had a chance to go and look at our slide of maintenance products, [audio break] where we feel lead to those acquisitions.", "We\u2019ll be looking globally too. It\u2019s not necessarily in the U.S. We see those opportunities in other countries around the world.", "[Henry Caplan \u2013 Oppenheimer]", "I think on the call you mentioned retailers may be becoming a little more aggressive in terms of inventory levels. I wanted to see to what extent that had been a rebuild in inventory at retail had been built into your guidance for 2010?", "Garry Ridge", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a rebuild. I think there\u2019s a stabilization. There might be a new level now, but you can\u2019t do business from an empty barrel so the retailers have to make sure they\u2019ve got product on shelf. But we\u2019ve never really benefited from a great build up in inventory. Our product moves through fairly quickly.", "But what we are seeing is a new level of certainty which is getting retail to promote more and really work with us on some of those activities. But I\u2019m not anticipating that our results are a huge inventory build up. I think they\u2019re more about promotional sale through and those sort of activities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Frank Magdlin \u2013 The Robins Group.", "Frank Magdlin \u2013 The Robins Group", "That was a nice quarter. I\u2019m looking and saying from your perspective what went better than you thought? You gave guidance and I know you do a good due diligence but some favorable things that you could highlight.", "Garry Ridge", "I think what we thought is it didn\u2019t get any worse than it did. I know that\u2019s a funny answer, but I think we live in a bit of uncertainty and certainly that got a little let up in the quarter. Certainly our gross margin was a little better than we had anticipated and that was a pleasing off set to us.", "We started a little bit to see the dollar come back a little bit. That was good for us. We loved the stabilization of our household products in the U.S. We think we\u2019ve got that stabilized. The U.S. had a good come back in the fourth quarter, so more promotional activities than usual.", "I think overall the business climate got a little more certain and we were able to control costs pretty well. We\u2019ve got a pretty good job of keeping the lid on stuff through the year, so I think that was also good.", "Jay Rembolt", "The margin did improve a little bit more than expected. We were anticipating a little over the 50% so to see it get to 51.6% was not what we clearly saw as we gave guidance in the third quarter.", "Frank Magdlin \u2013 The Robins Group", "When you\u2019re looking out as we\u2019re trying to figure out quarterly results, is there anything other than the back end for the Blue Works that\u2019s taking place that might change the strength of a quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019ve always said please don\u2019t try to manage us quarter by quarter, and I know that\u2019s tough because that\u2019s something you have to do. But it will depend on promotions shift and when they fall. We feel okay about the year at this time and we\u2019re going to, I\u2019m describing this year as a perfect game of golf. ", "And why do I say that? We have to play each month as if it was a new hole, not letting the past month or the hole in front of us influence our thinking that much as far as operational excellence is concerned. So I think that the things that are good is a little stability. The doom and gloomers have probably gone away a little bit and that\u2019s opening up our opportunities.", "I wish I could give you a better guidance. We did guide quarterly last year because we saw such a big fluctuation in what happened before, but we don\u2019t necessarily know if it\u2019s going to happen this year.", "Frank Magdlin \u2013 The Robins Group", "To switch to manufacturing, the Smart Straw in Europe, was that in effect for all of the fourth quarter?", "Jay Rembolt", "A large chunk of the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "When you were talking about your prices being up, did you mean your prices were up or did you mean your mix was positive?", "Jay Rembolt", "If we look at the impact of our margin, and I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re talking about the same thing, we did have price increases in Q1 and Q2 of \u201909, of the current year which had an impact as we got to the end of the year and when we have comparisons year on year. So we saw for the full year, we saw nearly 470 basis points of impact because of the price increases.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "What I was trying to understand is you\u2019ve done a nice job of penetrating your demand base for more Smart Straw and I would imagine your Smart Straw can is more expensive than the non Smart Straw can. You\u2019ve had other improvements in your product line so I was wondering how much came from selling these higher priced cans and how much came from the straight price increase with the same product year over year.", "Garry Ridge", "About 39% of our business is now Smart Straw so there is a big part of that in Smart Straw, and there\u2019s no doubt our revenue per ounce has increased because we had an increase in cost with Smart Straw and an increase in sell price with Smart Straw so there is a little bit of that going on.", "But it\u2019s still about 39% of our total volume of our multi-purpose maintenance products, so there\u2019s still 60% that is in the classic can.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan. Chase", "So by the end of next year, what do you think the percentages will look like?", "Garry Ridge", "Probably reasonably similar because the big change was the conversion in the U.S. We\u2019re not planning to wholesaling convert any other markets although we are increasing our volume in Smart Strewing in the developing European markets through just over time. We\u2019re more allowing the consumer there to make the choice and they are making Smart Straw choices. So I don\u2019t know that that will change a lot from what I can see today.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, you\u2019re going to go up against a revenue comparison that really happened before the financial crisis began. So I would think that, and you probably still have some tougher currency comparisons all things being equal, so all things being equal is it likely that your first quarter is your toughest earnings comparison of the year?", "Garry Ridge", "I would choose as I never do make those comparisons public, not to make that comparison. But I\u2019m not sure the economic conditions hadn\u2019t already started to happen back then. Also remember the first quarter last year we were selling against price rise as well. So I think that the thing that we\u2019re looking at now is we\u2019re going into a new year. Our margins are holding up. We think volumes have stabilized. We getting a lesser impact on the U.S. dollar.", "We won\u2019t get the full; the biggest impact on the dollar was in the second quarter when we dipped down to $1.35 to $1.40. So the comps have got to get better going forward, but I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re going to be that dramatic.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan, Chase", "Do you think you can grow household products next year or is that too hard?", "Garry Ridge", "No. We don\u2019t plan to grow household. It will grow outside of the United States. We\u2019re now harvesting household and I think it\u2019s stabilized. But because we made the decision not to increase investment particularly in R&D and put it into things like Blue Works and some other initiatives that we\u2019ve got in the works for our multi-purpose maintenance products and adjacent categories, no we won\u2019t.", "Operator", "We have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay, we\u2019re done. Thanks very much and we\u2019ll be with you come December time."]}

Today we\u2019re pleased to have Garry Ridge, President and CEO and Jay Rembolt, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company\u2019s outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results.

", "Our third quarter fiscal 2010 earnings conference call is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, July 7, 2010 at 2PM.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Garry Ridge.", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Today we reported net sales of $80.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 30% over Q2 last fiscal year.  Year-to-date, net sales were $158.3 million, an increase of 9% versus the same period last year.  Net income for the second quarter was $10.7 million compared to $4.1 million in Q2 last fiscal year.  Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.64 compared to $0.25 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Year-to-date net income was $20.1 million compared to $11.8 million in the same period last year and year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $1.20 up from $0.71 in the same period last year.  These results reflect the continued improvement in global economic conditions and the execution of our core strategic initiatives.  We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in sales over the past year across all of our three trading blocks which are the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.", "This steady increase in sales is mostly due to organic growth and a recovery in our base period rather than price increases or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  The top line growth has flowed down to the bottom line as we have maintained both a healthy gross margin and level operating expenses.  We offset the rise in some of our major input costs through disciplined management of promotional discounts along with increased efficiencies in our supply chain network.  ", "Total operating expenses have remained relatively flat for the period-over-period and have decreased as a percentage of sales.  Year-to-date operating expenses also do not include the brand impairment charge that we experienced in the prior fiscal year.  Our results year-to-date have been positive and this strengthens our outlook for the rest of this fiscal year 2010.  In addition to positive trends in the global economy and our operating results we continue to make progress in our four major strategic initiatives during the quarter.  We call them the fantastic four.", "Now, talking about a little; global expansion our first initiative continues to be a major drive in our sales growth.  All three trading blocks experienced sales growth period-over-period as well as compared to the first quarter of the current fiscal year.  We saw the greatest percentage increase among our international markets primarily Europe and Asia Pacific.  Period-over-period total sales outside the US grew by 41% in the second quarter and 10% as compared to the prior fiscal year periods.", "As a percentage of total revenue sales outside the US were 55% of global sales in the second quarter compared to 51% in the prior fiscal year period.  Global expansion also applies to our supply chain network.  In the second quarter we realized gross margin benefits from the expansion of our Smart Straw manufacturing in to Europe.  This initiative mitigates foreign currency exchange rate risks to our cost of product while also realizing the cost savings in freight and inventory carrying costs.  We see many sales and supply chain opportunities through our global expansion initiatives.  ", "The launch of our Blue Works brand during the second quarter helped us continue our focus on our second initiative which is maximizing our position in the multipurpose maintenance product segments.  Blue Works is a best in class product line specifically for industrial maintenance and repair market users.  The trial and buy nature of this channel will translate in to a slows sales ramp up compared to the front load nature of our traditional retail sales model.  However, the sales and potential high gross margins from Blue Works is expected to be accretive to our business in the long term within both US and international markets.", "During the quarter we launched advertising and sampling promotions in industrial trade magazines and print.  Early indications from these advertising vehicles are positive.  Just like the launch of our original WD-40 product, we are continuing to convert one user at a time for a life time.  ", "For our third initiative, developing our business through acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and strategic partnerships, we continue to evaluate potential partners and refine our strategy for pursing licensing opportunities.  As we have discussed with you before, we want to find the right opportunity versus any opportunity and ensure that we invest our time, talent and treasure in programs that will provide long term growth and returns for our shareholders and for our tribe members.", "In addition to acquisitions we continue to evaluate alternative strategies for some of our homecare and cleaning products brands.  While our goal is to continue to harvest these brands, we are open to potential divestiture opportunities.  Ideally, any divestiture of a homecare and cleaning product brand would coincide with an opportunity in our multipurpose maintenance product segment or segments identified in our sandbox of play.", "As for our fourth strategic initiative, WD-40 brand exploration we\u2019ve made concrete progress in leveraging our core brand across our portfolio of businesses.  Blue Works, which launched in Q2 is the first product to carry the WD-40 company signature of endorsement, also referred to internally as the WD-40 DNA.   We believe WD-40 DNA will communicate our brand\u2019s legacy and leverage as an endorsement on other products.", "In addition, our Blue Works to Blue Works we\u2019ve completed the packaging and creative design on several products and promotional SKUs that include the WD-40 DNA.  You will see some of these revised packaging starting to appear on shelves in Q4 of this fiscal year.  In addition to the WD-40 DNA, our brand exploration and extension project team or BEEP as we like to call them here continue to research to better understand the future opportunities we have to establish with end users through the loyalty that we\u2019ve established with the WD-40 brand.", "Now that we\u2019ve covered the update on the strategic initiatives, let\u2019s talk about our second quarter results in a little more detail.  We are pleased with the sales and profit growth in Q2 as well as the positive trends towards these over our last few quarters.  Our multipurpose maintenance product sales were up 39% in Q2 and up 12% year-to-date.  While the prior fiscal year second quarter reflected the worse of the recession, our current fiscal year second quarter results of $65.6 million reflected an 8% growth over this fiscal year\u2019s first quarter results of $60.7 million.", "Q2 was the largest sales quarter we\u2019ve had in over a year driven primarily by the resurgence of WD-40 across all three major trading blocks.  Global sales of WD-40 grew 40% in Q2 compared to the same period last year while 3-in-one sales grew 25% compared to the same period last fiscal year.  Year-to-date global WD-40 sales grew by 12% while 3-in-one sales grew by 15% year-to-date.  The growth of the WD-40 sales was driven by increased distribution in our current customers and new distribution and promotional activities where sales of 3-in-one were boosted by new innovation and distribution in the Asia Pacific region.", "In Q1 we launched a new formula of 3-in-one in China targeted specifically at the automotive trade channel under the 3-in-one pro line.  Blue Works launched during the quarter in the US and accounted for less than 1% of global sales.  By trade block sales of multipurpose maintenance products in Q4 were up 29% in the Americas, up 51% in Europe and up 55% in Asia Pacific.  Homecare and cleaning products were up 1% globally in Q2 versus the same period last year.  This group includes SpotShot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, 1001, X14 and Lava and Solvol brands.", "By trading blocks, sales of homecare and cleaning products in Q2 were down 3% in the Americas, up 5% in Europe and up 40% in Asia Pacific.  The slight decrease in the Americas was due to strong SpotShot sales being offset by sales declines across other brands.  The growth in Europe was entirely due to the 1001 brand and the growth in Asia Pacific was driven by Australia which was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the level of promotional activities and increased distribution of Novak.", "Now, on to our results by segment; as mentioned earlier, we expect to experience healthy growth across all three trading blocks.  Price increases most of which occurred in Q1 of fiscal year 2009 have little impact on sales in the current quarter as compared to the same period last year.  There was favorable impact from changes in foreign currency and exchange rates mostly in the European trading block.  On a constant currency basis, our global net sales in the second quarter would have been $76.7 million versus the actual of $80.6 million.  Year-to-date global sales in constant currency would have been $156.2 million versus $158.3 million. ", "Sales in the Americas increased to $44.2 million in Q2, up $7 million or 19% versus Q2 last year.  Year-to-date sales in the Americas were up 6%.  In the US sales increased by 19% in the second quarter and 6% year-to-date driven by higher sales of WD-40 and SpotShot.  The sales growth was attributed to improved economic conditions, new distribution and timing of promotional activities in many of our accounts.  Homecare and cleaning product sales were down 4% in Q2 and down 1% year-to-date with growth in the SpotShot brand offset by declines in other brands.", "The most significant of these sales decreases in the second quarter was from the Carpet Fresh brand and X14 hard surface cleaner which decreased $300,000 or 19% and $200,000 or 28% respectively.  These declines were a result of several factors including lost distribution, the discontinuation of certain product offerings and the effects of our competitive factors, our strategic decision to focus our research and development on resources on our multipurpose maintenance product segments and other areas within our identified sandbox.", "Sales in Latin America increased by 10% in the second quarter and 1% year-to-date with most of the growth in the WD-40 brand.  Sales in Canada increased by 23% in the second quarter and 3% compared to the last fiscal year-to-date.  Canada\u2019s growth was driven by WD-40 and SpotShot as well as a favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  On a constant currency basis, sales in Canada grew 6% in the same quarter and were down 5% compared to the same period of last fiscal year.  ", "We also began shipping Blue Works product line in December as I mentioned.  Due to the trial and buying nature of this target market, we experienced a high level of sampling rather than front loading of our sales.  Blue Works is being marketed directly to industrial users versus being sold in retail outlets.  We expect to see a modest increase in sales over time as we build distribution with our industrial customers.  ", "Sales in Europe increased to $28.6 million in Q2, up $9.1 million or 46% versus Q2 of last fiscal year.  Year-to-date sales in Europe were up 12%.  The substantial growth in the second quarter led to the segment increasing to 35% of our global sales compared to 32% in prior and fiscal year periods.  A portion of the sales increase was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus period-over-period.  European sales on a constant currency basis would have been $26.1 million in the second quarter with a 34% growth for the period.", "Foreign currency impact was negligible year-to-date as sales on a constant currency basis would have been $55.5 million versus the actual of $55.9 million.  We sell in to Europe through a combination of direct operations in certain countries as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in other countries.  Both markets generated double digit sales increases in the second quarter in both actual results and constant currency.  ", "We have a direct sales force in the UK, Italy, France and Iberia which includes Spain and Portugal and in the markets we term as the [inaudible] which includes Germany, Austria, Denmark, Holland and Switzerland.  All of these direct markets grew versus prior fiscal year quarter and in total were up 37% in Q2 and up 14% year-to-date.  The sales growth in our direct markets was primarily due to economic conditions that continued growth of our WD-40 Smart Straw delivery system, new distribution and increased promotional activities.  France and Iberia also benefitted from continued growth of the 3-in-one line of products.", "We sold through exclusive independent market distributors in eastern and northern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. We virtually all sales consisting of the WD-40 brand.  All three distributor markets grew versus the prior fiscal year in the quarter and in total were up 78% in Q2 and 9% year-to-date.  ", "Now to Asia Pacific where sales increased to $7.7 million in Q2, up $2.7 million or 53% versus Q2 last fiscal year.  Year-to-date sales in Asia Pacific were up 12%.  This substantial growth in the second quarter led to the segment increasing to 10% of global sales versus 8% in the prior fiscal year period.  A portion of the sales increase was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates period-versus-period.  Asia Pacific sales on a constant currency basis would have been $6.9 million for the second quarter with a 35% growth.  Year-to-date sales on a constant currency basis would be $13.4 million versus the actual $14.4 million.", "Sales in Australia increased 52% in the second quarter and 29% year-to-date compared to the same period over last fiscal year.  On a constant currency basis sales increased 12% in Q2 and 4% year-to-date.  The sales growth in Australia was mainly due to favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, promotional activities and new distribution of WD-40 brand including Smart Straw.  ", "China and many of the Asian markets in other regions experienced sales growth in the second quarter compared to both the prior fiscal year period and most recent Q1.  Sales in Asia including China represented 61% of total sales in the Asia Pacific segment in Q2 and increased 53% for the quarter.  China sales grew 7% while sales across the rest of the Asian region increased 75% from the period-to-period.  This sales growth was attributed to higher sales of WD-40 products stemming from improved economic conditions, increased distribution and significant promotional activities compared to the Q2 of last fiscal year.", "I\u2019m going to take a break.  That\u2019s it for the sales update.  Now, over to Jay Rembold who will continue the review of our financials.  ", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "First, just a reminder for you to review our 10Q which we\u2019ll file April the 8th.  Now, on to the rest of our second quarter results beginning with gross margin. We\u2019re pleased that in addition to the strong sales during the quarter we were able again to keep our gross margin above the 50% level as is our stated goal.  Gross margin in the second quarter was 52.4% compared to the 49.6% in Q2 last year.  The 280 basis point increase was primarily attributable to lower discounts and the positive impact from sourcing changes partially offset by a net increase in input costs.", "Price increases that were implemented in Q1 and Q2 of last year added about 10 basis points to the margin in the current quarter.  The lower discounts were much more impactful increasing our gross margin by 140 basis points.  Discounts to net sales include coupon redemptions, allowances to retailers for space, club advertising, promotional activity, volume discounts and other one-time or ongoing promotional incentives.  Period-versus-period, a lower portion of our sales was subject to these allowances in this year\u2019s quarter.  ", "Let\u2019s look at the shifts in major input costs.  While our Q2 petroleum based costs were lower than in the prior year, we experienced a net increase in input costs primarily due to aerosol cans.  Cost for our petroleum based materials were lower in this quarter than in Q2 last year and benefitted gross margin by 70 basis points.  This benefit was more than offset by the dramatic increase in the cost of our aerosol cans that began in Q2 of fiscal \u201909.  The higher cost of cans negatively impact our gross margin in the current period by 150 basis points.  ", "Just a quick look back, although oil prices in the market were much lower last year in Q2, the impact of these low prices had not yet made their way in to our Q2 cost of goods based on our production and inventory life cycles.  There\u2019s approximately a three to four month lag before these costs actually hit our cost of goods.  ", "Impact related to sourcing changes positively affected our gross margin by 140 basis points.  These changes include lower manufacturing costs associated in investments in equipment, lower manufacturing costs and supply chain efficiencies achieved from our supplier consolidation efforts and expansion of Smart Straw manufacturing to Europe which as Garry said mitigated any foreign currency impacts and also reduced freight and inventory storage costs.  Changes in sales mix benefitted gross margins by 50 basis points while other miscellaneous impacts combined positively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points.  This completes the gross margin discussion.  ", "Now, on to other operating expenses beginning with selling, general and administrative expenses.  Our SG&A expense in Q2 was $20.1 million versus the $17.8 million in the prior year quarter and as a percentage of sales was 24.9% versus 28.8% in the prior year period.  The increase in SG&A expenditure was primarily due to higher employee related costs and foreign currency exchange impacts.  Employee related costs increased by $1.2 million primarily due to higher bonus expense.  Many of our regions are expected to achieve higher sales and profit performance metrics for fiscal 2010 as compared to the prior year.  ", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to Q2 last year increased SG&A expenses by $.9 million.  Freight and all other expenses combined increased $.3 million period-to-period.  Advertising, sales and promotion expense in Q2 was $5.4 million versus $4.6 million in the prior year quarter.  Due to higher sales volumes in the current year advertising and promotion expense decreased as a percentage of sales to 6.6% versus 7.4% in Q2 last year.  The increase in expenditure was primarily due to the timing of investment in advertising activities and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.", "Amortization of intangible assets was $.2 million compared to $.1 million in the prior year quarter.  The current quarter includes amortization related to the Carpet Fresh and the X14 trade names which were both changed to definite life intangibles at August 31st of last year.  Both periods include $.1 million of amortization related to customer lists acquired in the 1001 acquisition which was completed in fiscal year 2004.  ", "Last year\u2019s results in the second quarter also included a $2.8 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Carpet Fresh brand. The annual impairment tests performed in the current quarter did not result in any impairment charges for either our goodwill or any of our other indefinite life intangible assets.  ", "The net total result in changes in operating expenses was negligible with operating expenses totaling $25.6 million in the current quarter versus $25.3 million in Q2 last year.  Due to higher sales volume and improved gross margins, our operating income in Q2 was $16.6 million compared to $5.3 million in the prior year.  ", "Net interest expense for Q2 was $.4 million down $.1 million versus the same period last year.  Our other income decreased by $.5 million primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses in Q2 versus foreign currency exchange gains in Q2 of the prior year.  Our provision for income taxes in Q2 was 34.2% versus 23% in the prior year quarter.  The low tax rate in Q2 last year was due to a onetime California tax law change that occurred during the quarter.  The tax law changed caused a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $.5 million in Q2 of last year.", "Net income in Q2 was $10.7 million versus $4.1 million in the prior year quarter.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net income of $.7 million in the quarter.  Q2 fiscal 2010 results on a constant currency basis would have produced net income of $10.0 million.  On a diluted share basis earnings were $0.64 in Q2 compared to the $0.25 in the prior year quarter.  Diluted shares outstanding were consistent with the prior year period at 16.7 million shares.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at the six month; many of the themes and drivers of the year-to-date results are consistent with those we just discussed for Q2.  The year-to-date gross margin of 51.9% is 420 basis points higher than the 47.7% achieved in the prior fiscal period.  Price increases and lower discounts contributed 80 basis points and 120 basis points respectively.  Lower petroleum based materials cost benefited gross margins by 200 basis points but were fully offset by the higher cost of cans which negatively impacted our gross margin by 240 basis points.  Sourcing changes favorably impacted gross margin by 170 basis points.  Both sales mix and other miscellaneous items had a favorable impact on gross margin of 70 basis points.  ", "Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $39 million to $39.9 million.  Due to the higher sales volume, SG&A as a percent of sales however decreased from 26.8% to 25.2%.  The increase in SG&A expenditure stems primarily from the employee related costs which increased by $1.9 million due to some annual compensation increases during the first quarter of 2009 as well as higher bonus accruals that we talked about.", "As noted in the Q2 highlights, many regions are expected to achieve higher sales and profit performance metrics for fiscal year 2010.  Partially offsetting the higher employer related expenses were lower freight of $.5 million resulting from shipping efficiencies, lower professional service costs of $.7 million primarily legal expenses and miscellaneous expenses lower by $.3 million, broker sales commission, stock based comp and bad debt expense combined.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the first half of last fiscal year increased SG&A expense by $.5 million.  Advertising and sales promotion expenses increased slightly to $10.6 million in the first six months compared to the $10.0 in the prior year period.  As a result of higher sales volumes in the current year advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased to 6.7% of net sales compared to the 6.9% in the prior year.", "Investment in global advertising sales promotion expenses for fiscal 2010 is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 8% of sales.  Amortization of intangible assets of $.4 million is related to the amortization of the 1,001 brand customer lists and the Carpet Fresh and X14 trade names.  Last year\u2019s first half results also included a $2.8 million impairment charge related to the Carpet Fresh brand.  No impairments were recorded in the first half of the current fiscal year.", "Total operating expenses were $50.8 million year-to-date compared to $50.2 million in the prior period.  Higher net sales combined with the improved gross margin and lower operating expenses resulted in a $13.9 million increase in operating income.  For the first six months of the year operating income was $31.3 million in fiscal 2010 versus $17.4 million in fiscal year 2009.  Net interest expense decreased $.1 million year-to-date to $.8 million.  Other income decreased $.6 million to $.1 million.  The decrease of other income was primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange gains.", "Provision for income taxes year-to-date increased from $31.4 million last year to $34.3 million in the current year.  As we discussed the prior year had a nice benefit from the California tax law changes.  Year-to-date net income was $20.1 million compared to $11.8 million in the same period last year.

Cash provided by operations was $23.4 million.  The issuance of common stock on the exercise of stock options provided an additional $.9 million of cash.  These cash inflows were partially offset by our $10.7 million annual principle payments, our dividend payments of $8.3 million during the year and $.8 million used for capital expenditures during the period.  Cash was also negatively impacted by $1.7 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.", "We continue to delever the company with our annual October $10.7 million principle payment.  As of February 28th our outstanding balance on our original $75 million loan was $21.4 million.  The final payment will be due October 2011.

Higher bonus, eligibility and payouts to our valued tribe members would be a good problem to have.", "So, we have revised our fiscal year guidance for 2010 which now reflects that.  We expect our net sales to be in the range of $308 to $321 million or growth of between 5.5 and 9.9% versus fiscal 2009.  We expect our global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 6.5% and 8% of net sales and we would expect net income to be between $32.2 and $33.8 million which would achieve EPS of between $1.92 and $2.01 assuming that we had 16.8 million shares outstanding.", "This fiscal year 2010 guidance does not include any acquisition activities and assumes foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to the recent levels.  As always we continue to search for new business opportunities and will share with you when those new developments evolve.  In closing I\u2019d like to share with you a quote from Abraham Lincoln.  You will remember this quote as I shared it with you in our shareholder letter last year.  It is, \u201cThe dogma\u2019s of the quite past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion.  As our case is anew, so we must think and act anew.\u201d  WD-40 Company is rising to the occasion as we continue to think and act a new.  ", "Before we open the call for questions, I would like to ensure that we share with you what we see are the key takeaways from today\u2019s call as it relates to the balance of this fiscal year.  We are cautiously optimistic about the positive trends in the global economy.  Our goal of achieving gross margin of about 50% is being realized.  The tailwind from lower oil prices is turning to a headwind as oil moves towards $90 a barrel.  We expect our bonus expense to be higher in Q3 and Q4 as it drives growth behaviors. ", "Blue Works is building slowly as expected.  Our work on leveraging the trust we\u2019ve established in the WD-40 brand continues.  Foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on our results during this current fiscal year.  We believe our homecare and cleaning product futures have stabilized for now.  Our brand investment for the year is in line with historical levels and we expect it to remain that way through the end of this fiscal year.", "Thank you for joining us today.  We\u2019d be pleased to now open the conference call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities.", "Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "A couple of questions, I\u2019m a little puzzled about your earnings guidance for the year in that you earned $1.20 in the first half of the year so in order to hit your guidance you\u2019d earn somewhere between $0.72 and $0.81 in the second half.   Last year you earned $1.02 in a second half and last year your sales were $146.5 million in the second half and this year you\u2019re projecting sales of somewhere between $149 and $162 million.  It seems that what you\u2019re projecting are sort of earnings going down 20% to 30% in the second half.  Is that what you mean to do?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "What we said is that we see a headwind to our gross margin.  We will have some higher A&P investments.  We will also expect some higher increased bonus expense which will reduce our earnings impact in the second half of the year.  ", "Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "No, I understand all of that but it would seem to me that your earnings really should be materially higher and as far as bonus expense goes, I think it\u2019s important that people be duly compensated but it\u2019s also the case that there really hasn\u2019t been much earnings growth over a multiyear period of time and your earnings were $1.84 last year on an adjusted basis and so growing to $1.92 to $2.01 is not in the scheme of things, all that strong, or is there a lot of play in your numbers?  Can it turn out that these are relatively conservative estimates?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "There\u2019s no doubt Jeff that as we\u2019ve always been we are cautious in our earnings estimates.  We are concerned a little about the movement in the oil price, it\u2019s approaching $90 now.  We don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to end up.  We\u2019re hopeful that the global economy will continue where it is so I think we\u2019re prudent in what we\u2019re saying.  Yes, we are being cautious, we don\u2019t want this to turn in to euphoria, we want to be responsible and give people a responsible view of where we think we are.  We have raised our guidance.  We are now seeing sales growth across all of our channels and certainly if the momentum off the first half of the year was to continue the way it has then the result will look different.  But, he who learns to forecast by the crystal ball learns to eat glass and we\u2019re being cautious and we\u2019re being certainly responsible.  ", "Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "So were your volumes this quarter unusual?  I mean certainly there was a very large year-over-year change.  Do you find your volumes in the second quarter unusually high and do you expect them or are you worried that they might sharply fall coming up?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "No, I think they returned to somewhat normal levels but we are getting a couple of offsets from that.  We\u2019re certainly getting unit volume growth, real volume growth across the world.  We\u2019re getting the benefit of higher sales dollars as more of our sales are now in Smart Straw which is increasing if you will, our revenue per ounce because of the delivery system.  That\u2019s been a positive.  ", "We went through a little traumatic time as we converted Smart Straw a year and a half ago that might have pulled us down a little lower.  I think we\u2019re returning to normal and we are seeing real volume growth.  We\u2019re seeing volume growth in the countries outside of the US that were a little flat so we\u2019re doing pretty well.", "Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "Just lastly, can you give us just some very, very rough targets for Blue Works either for 2010 or for 2012?  What are you hoping to achieve in terms of sales of these products?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "We don\u2019t know yet Jeff and I don\u2019t want to tip my hand to our competitor.  We\u2019ll give you a little better update of that at the end of Q3 and Q4.  But, we believe that say it\u2019s a good piece of the business.  If you look at the aggregate size of the market, it\u2019s probably in total somewhere in the $300 to $400 million and we would like to get a nice piece of that but right now it\u2019s a different business model.  We\u2019re selling to end users which we\u2019ve never done before directly with this product line.  But so far it\u2019s been very encouraging.

Is that the case?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "The guidance is assuming that oil is going to move from a tailwind to a headwind and cans are probably stable.  ", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "But you\u2019re baking in $88 to $90 oil in the second half in to that guidance?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Yes.", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Now, in terms of your can costs, you guys essentially figure out what they are roughly around January for the next 12 months so can costs at this point are pretty much locked in, right?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Yes, until they decide to unlock them like they did once before but we believe they are somewhat stable now.", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "So on the oil side have you guys done any hedging or anything like that to mitigate that?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "No.  We\u2019ve looked at opportunities but it\u2019s difficult.", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Then moving on to WD-40, you mentioned the brand was up 40% globally, can you remind us what the year ago period was, what kind of base period were we working against?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Go to your next question and someone will look it up.", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "In terms of that 40% you mentioned a couple things to drill a bit, distribution and promotion activity, on the distribution side was it expanding in to new markets or was it driving deeper in to existing markets?  Could you give us a little more color around the term distribution?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "In markets that still have upside market potential both things are going on.  In places like China and Russia and France and Germany and Spain, as well as selling deeper in to current distribution, we sell to new people every day, both end users and customers.  In the US there would have been not necessarily new distribution but certainly I think we have seen stocking levels in the US return to norm and of course we\u2019re getting a lot of benefit from our Smart Straw.", "We converted that in the US nearly two years ago now, I think it was April 1st two years ago and it\u2019s really now embedded in to the distribution system.  The promotional activity with that is strong.  That\u2019s really two sides. We\u2019re seeing real unit volume growth in ounces in every trading block around the world.", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "You mentioned in the US you\u2019re seeing more normalized retail activity or inventory activity so does that indicate you saw a little bit of a restock in the quarter?  ", "Garry O. Ridge ", "No.  What happened was we\u2019re getting a lot of good promotional activity now.  We never suffered dramatically by destocking.  Where we saw restocking a little bit is more in the industrial segment.  I think we\u2019re seeing some of the smaller industrial accounts are now getting back in to business as manufacturing returns so consumption is going back there, there\u2019s restocking.  But, that would be where it was.  On your question on WD-40 prior year quarter was $43.6 million, this quarter is $61.3 million.  ", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "In terms of the year-over-year change, what was the WD-40 performance in the year ago period?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "$43.6 million in the same period versus $61.3 million this quarter.", "Joseph Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "I guess lastly, this is more of an M&A question but Gary you mentioned homecare and cleaning looking at some alternatives there, has there been interest in that segment?  Secondly, in terms of acquisitions, have you seen any increase in potential properties or opportunities for you?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "The first question has there been any interest, we don\u2019t have a for sale sign on these things so we monitor them.  On the acquisition side, there\u2019s stuff happening out there.  We\u2019re still not excited about either the quality or the price of things that we\u2019re seeing but we continue to look globally for those sort of opportunities.  But, what\u2019s really exciting now is the organic growth that\u2019s coming from a lot of work that\u2019s being done on product innovation and truly strengthening our global trade show.", "The question you meant to ask that you forgot to ask me is what percentage of our business I outside the US now and 55% of our total company sales are now outside the United States up from 51% a year ago and that\u2019s the fastest growing part of our business so we are truly a global company.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC.", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC.", "I guess you mentioned in your comment, you mentioned that a major contribution to margin and progressed margin improvement were better management of promotional discounts.  Is that a sustainable strategy in the future?", "Jay W. Rembolt ", "We\u2019ll we\u2019ve seen it both in the first quarter and the second quarter.  I\u2019m sure that we will change.  If you look back to really the prior year, some of the things that we had done was change some of our promotional tactics to better incentivize promotional activity by our customers.  So we would have gone to a little bit heavier activities around in those areas so that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done less of in the current quarter as well as in the prior quarter and we\u2019re just evaluating how much that marketing mix continues to change.", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Some of the things that have changed too Liam, and I\u2019ll give you an example of how the discounts and allowances may have changed but the promotional power hasn\u2019t, one of the big large promotions that we\u2019ve got going at the moment is a twin pack of WD-40 with a free bonus of a 3-in-one no rust shield.  A couple of things are happening there, we are offering great value to our end users and to our customer because of some of the efficiencies we\u2019ve had in the supply chain the margins are still being held up because the cost of that promotional activity is in the gross margin but we don\u2019t have to give it away as price when we\u2019re giving it away as value.  These are some of the things.", "The other thing that is happening too is that as that mix of sales changes and we\u2019re getting a higher percentage of sales in our multipurpose maintenance product category away from homecare and cleaning, there are less of the sales promotional discounts driven in those trade channels than there are typically in the deep discounting of the grocery trade channel.", "Liam D. Burke \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC.", "On the Asia Pacific you had about a 7% increase in revenue from China.  That\u2019s been an area of investment, last quarter I believe year-over-year numbers were down, are you seeing some positive momentum there?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Yes, we are.  We certainly have seen that the manufacturing segments that we\u2019re selling in to are starting to improve.  We\u2019re very bullish long term on China.  This is not a Rome was built in one day deal, as I said in the last conference call it\u2019s going to be a bit of a bumpy ride as we go through it but China will be just an unbelievable market for us over time.  We just have to be patient and make sure that we\u2019re delivering good value on our time, talent and treasure there.  Id\u2019 ask everyone to be patient it\u2019s actually on a profitability basis performing better than we expected because normally we\u2019d be pouring investment in there and it\u2019s actually doing well for us.  So China is a long term bet but it\u2019s a big one and it\u2019s going to be great.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Loran Braverman \u2013 Standard & Poors.", "Loran Braverman \u2013 Standard & Poors", "Earlier you gave some sort of a market size figure for Blue Works, I think it was around $300 to $400 million and I wondered if that was just in the US or if that was a global figure?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "The number I said was an aggregate size of what we can see the visible competitive set is in that market.  I don\u2019t know if that is a market size or not but it is what we see.", "Loran Braverman \u2013 Standard & Poors", "Was that just US or was that global?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "That\u2019s just US.", "Loran Braverman \u2013 Standard & Poors", "Also, you provide so much information in your release and then so much on the call but I\u2019m curious as to whether it would be possible for you to supply the operating profits by the geographic segments?  I know we can get it in the 10Q but it\u2019s practically the only major information you don\u2019t supply on either the release or the call and just speaking for myself I\u2019m often surprised when I see the margins, sometimes one division is dramatically different than I would have expected and I don\u2019t know to ask about it until after the Q is out.  I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible to supply that in the release?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Thanks for the feedback we\u2019ll take that on notice and we\u2019ll see what we can do.  But, the Q will be delivered tomorrow though.", "Loran Braverman \u2013 Standard & Poors", "In the quarter you just reported, given how much the margin is up versus last year I would expect all of the geographic segments to have had higher margins.  But, given the Americas is still the largest single component they must have been dramatically higher, even higher than it would have been in the November quarter, my guess, in order to come out with the operating margin.  I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything that I should be asking now that I would be asking tomorrow after I see the 10Q in terms of the Americas margin and sustainability in that segment?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "It\u2019s pretty vanilla really.  We had increased sales on a higher gross margin number on relatively flat operating expenses.  The two things that are really driven is we are getting growth in sales and we have strengthened our gross margin.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Felice \u2013 J Goldman & Company.", "Robert Felice \u2013 J Goldman & Company", "Most of my questions have been answered I just have one or two others.  Can you give us a sense as to how much you expect SG&A to increase in the second half of 2010 versus the first half of 2010?  I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the headwinds you\u2019re facing as a result of the incremental bonuses and any other expenses.  ", "Garry O. Ridge ", "We don\u2019t guide that detail.  It will be in the 6.5% to 8% range that we\u2019ve shared.  But, because promotional periods and promotions can move quarter-to-quarter we don\u2019t get that granular.", "Robert Felice \u2013 J Goldman & Company", "No, Garry not on the advertising and sales, I was talking on the SG&A side.", "Garry O. Ridge ", "I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t guide to that.", "Robert Felice \u2013 J Goldman & Company", "Can you give us a sense as to the incremental bonus expense at least given that you called that out specifically?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "We don\u2019t know what it is yet because we haven\u2019t gotten the results because it\u2019s driven by results.", "Robert Felice \u2013 J Goldman & Company", "Then just lastly, in the press release Garry you made a comment that if oil prices and other commodities stay at their current levels you\u2019d expect to be able to sustain gross margins above the 50% target level.  Is that an assumption that is currently baked in to the guidance?", "Garry O. Ridge ", "Well yes and no.  If you look at the first half of the year our goal is to get margin up above 50%.  We\u2019ve actually been running at about 51.4% which is a high class problem to have.  We think we can stay above 50% but we\u2019re assuming that for the full year we\u2019re not going to have the second half at 51.4%, it might be somewhat less than that but we don\u2019t really know yet.  We\u2019re confident for the full year we\u2019ll definitely be above 50%, we\u2019re at 51.4% now.  It would be great if we could end the year at 51.4%.  That\u2019s not baked in to the assumption, there\u2019s too many variables on that but the 50% is okay.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen there are no other questions holding so I\u2019ll turn it back over to Garry Ridge for any additional or closing comments.", "Garry O. Ridge ", "That\u2019s it for us.  We\u2019ll get out and sell some stuff and we\u2019ll talk to you in about another 90 days.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations for WD-40 Company, Ms. Maria Mitchell. You may begin.", "Maria M. Mitchell", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Call. Today, we are pleased to have Garry Ridge, President and CEO; and Jay Rembolt, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company's outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results. These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, including the impact of commodity prices, impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of introducing new products and fluctuating global market condition, both in the United States and internationally.", "The company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the company to have a reasonable basis. But there can be no assurance that the company's expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or accomplished. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by WD-40 Company with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and readers are urged to carefully review these and other documents and to stay up-to-date with our most recent company developments provided in the Investor Relations section of our company website at wd40company.com.", "Our second quarter fiscal '13 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, April 4, 2013.", "Now, I'd like to pass it over to Garry Ridge.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thank you, Maria. Good day and Happy New Year. Thanks for joining us. Today, we reported net sales of $95.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, an increase of 12% over Q1 last fiscal year. Q1 was a new record revenue quarter for the company.", "Net income for the first quarter was $10.9 million compared to $6.8 million in Q1 last fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.69 compared to $0.42 for the same period last year. As we review our results for the first quarter, we'll be doing so under our 50/30/20 rule and our strategic initiatives. Q1 was a good quarter for us. We grew total sales by 12% versus the prior-year quarter and increased our gross margin to over 50%, largely due to the benefits stemming from our strategic initiatives.", "So let's take a closer look at the progress we made in the first quarter towards our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative #1, is to maximize the WD-40 brand. Sales of WD-40 multi-use products increased by 13% in the first quarter compared to Q1 last fiscal year. We experienced double-digit growths in several key markets including more developed markets such as the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Australia, as well as our distributor markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.", "Strategic initiative #2, to be the global leader in the company's product categories within our prioritized platforms. The WD-40 Specialist product line, which we launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of last fiscal year, is helping to solidify our leadership in the marketplace. In fiscal year 2012, we increased distribution in the U.S. as well as launched in a selected other countries in Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia. In the current quarter, we launched the Specialist product line in Russia and the Middle East, as well as some smaller markets such as Puerto Rico, Malaysia and Cyprus. We are not only excited about the incremental sales this new product gives us, but the power it gives the entire brand and the yellow shield.", "We attributed some of the growth in our -- of our multi-use product to the increased distribution and shelf presence we have generated with WD-40 Specialist product line. As for BLUE WORKS, we've decided to transition industrial uses in the U.S. to the WD-40 Specialist product line over the longer term. Some SKUs will be in transition this year and we'll be working on new formulations and additional WD-40 Specialist product line SKUs to better serve our industrial market. We are also evaluating the future of BLUE WORKS in other geographic markets.", "On to strategic driver, initiative #3, strategic business relationships. We did not find an acquisition opportunity that met our criteria in the first quarter, but we continue to explore licensing and partnership arrangements to build our product offerings for our next-generation of WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE products. Some products within the WD-40 Specialist product line by WD-40 BIKE and WD-40 Specialist motorbike stem from alliances with key partners. We are finding that strategic business relationships enable us to go to market faster with more expertise and less risk.", "On our strategic driver #4, which is global innovation efforts. Our new business unit, WD-40 BIKE Company LLC made its first shipments late in the first quarter. WD-40 BIKE is dedicated to solving cycling and maintenance problems of riders by delivering WD-40-branded solutions that are easy to use, easy to find, provide good value and get the job done. The go-to-market strategy for WD-40 BIKE is different from our traditional model. We are concentrating our efforts on user-end trial and trade channels where cyclists buy their products, such as small independent bike dealers, versus larger retailers where our WD-40 brand products are sold. That said, we expect sales to be immaterial in the first year of its launch.", "We continue to make progress in the U.K. and to develop a line of motorbike-specific products under the WD-40 Specialist product line. These products will make maintenance and repair needs among motorcycle enthusiasts and mechanics for uses in garages and workshops and motorcycle race events. In the first quarter, we continued development and testing of formulations as well as packaging and marketing concepts. We anticipate launching motorbike products in the third quarter of the fiscal year.", "Strategic initiative #5, people development. Last but by no means least, under our fifth strategic initiative, we continue to attract and develop and retain tribe members to execute our vision. In the first quarter, we expanded our tribe by 12 people primarily to support the U.S., Europe and Latin American businesses.", "That completes the update on our strategic initiatives. So let's move on to the details of our first quarter results starting with sales. While we did see some sales we expected in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year to shift into the first quarter of the fiscal year 2013, particularly in Europe, we are proud of the solid sales growth we have had in the quarter. All of our growth period-versus-period came from our brands in the multi-purpose maintenance products category. Markets outside of the U.S. accounted for 62% of our global sales in both periods. Sales in the multi-purpose maintenance products category accounted for 86% of global sales compared to 83% in the prior-year period. Our multi-purpose maintenance product sales were up 15% in Q1 compared to prior-fiscal year quarter. By trading block, the category was up 19% in the Americas, up 17% in Europe and up 3% in Asia-Pacific. While most of the growth was driven by WD-40 multi-use product, we also generated growth from sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "Global WD-40 brand sales grew by $10.9 million or 16% in Q1 compared to the prior fiscal year quarter. This was driven by sales growth in both of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product and the WD-40 Specialist product line. Most of the growth was driven by the Americas and Europe. Sales in the Americas benefited from the increased distribution and higher promotional activity in the U.S. Europe benefited by higher replenishment orders after several quarters of slower sales. Both trading blocks also benefited from increased distribution and sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "3-IN-ONE brand sales increased by 2%. Growth in Europe more than offset declines in the Americas and Asia-Pacific trading blocks. Europe is the largest market for 3-IN-ONE with sales growth partially driven by new SKUs in the U.K., Spain and Portugal markets.", "Homecare and cleaning product sales continue to represent a smaller portion of our business per our strategic roadmap. The category accounted for 14% of global net sales in Q1 compared to 17% in the prior fiscal-year period. These products include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh and No Vac, 1001, X-14 and Lava and Solvol brands. Total homecare and cleaning product sales were down 4% globally in Q1. By trade blocks, sales of homecare and cleaning products were down 10% in the Americas, up 19% in Europe and up 10% in Asia-Pacific. Decreased sales of homecare and cleaning products in the Americas was mostly attributed to the Carpet Fresh and Spot Shot brands in the U.S., which were down 29% and 13%, respectively. These brands were impacted by some loss distribution, decreased promotional programs and category declines particularly in the warehouse pub channel.", "The higher sales in Europe were partially due to the timing of promotional activities year-over-year. In the prior-year period, sales of the 1001 brand dropped significantly following a strong promotional period and price increase. The current quarter was not impacted by these factors. The higher sales of homecare and cleaning products in Asia-Pacific were driven by sales and increased SKUs of the No Vac brand in Australia.", "Now let's look a little closer at the segments, and we'll start with the Americas. Sales in the Americas increased to $45.3 million in Q1, up $4.7 million or 12% versus Q1 last year. The segment accounted for 48% of global sales in both periods. Multi-purpose maintenance products were up 19% in Q1 and homecare and cleaning products were down 10% to the prior fiscal-year period primarily driven by sales declines in the U.S. Total U.S. sales were up 13% driven by the WD-40 brand including the WD-40 Specialist product line. Multi-purpose maintenance product sales in total were up 25% in Q1 and homecare and cleaning products were down 12% to the prior year fiscal period.", "Sales in Latin America increased by 6% in the first quarter driven by higher WD-40 sales in our distributor markets. And sales in Canada increased by 2% in the first quarter primarily due to higher sales of 2000 Flushes and the WD-40 brand, which more than offset decreases in other brands. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales.", "We'll go across the pond now to Europe. Sales in Europe increased to $35.2 million in Q1 up 17% versus Q1 last year. The segment accounted for 37% of global sales compared to 35% in Q1 of last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates period-versus-period did not have a material impact on sales. We fell into Europe through a combination of direct operations in certain countries as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in others. Sales in our European direct markets were up 22% in Q1. The increase is due to higher level of replenishment orders period-versus-period. Replenishment orders in the prior-year period were relatively low following a strong promotional sales period in FY '11 and the uncertain economic conditions, which existed throughout Europe at that time. While Europe continues to be impacted by uncertainty, we've seen improvement in some of our direct markets after a weak third and fourth quarter sales in fiscal year 2012.", "We sell through exclusive marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe and in the Middle East & Africa with virtually all sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. Our distributor markets, in total, were up 10% in Q1. Sales increased in the Middle East and Eastern Europe due to the continued growth of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product as well as initial sales of WD-40 Specialist product line. This growth more than offset lower sales in Northern Europe. The distributor markets accounted for 40% of Europe's total sales in Q1 compared to 43% in the prior fiscal-year period.", "Now let's slip over to Asia-Pacific. Sales in Asia/Pacific increased to $14.7 million in Q1 or up 3% versus Q1 last year. This segment accounted for 15% of global sales in Q1 versus 17% in the prior-year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rate period-versus-period did not have a material impact on sales.", "Sales in Australia increased 13% in Q1 compared to the prior-fiscal-year period driven by higher sales of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product and No Vac. Sales in Australia benefited by the more stable -- from the more stable economic conditions and the ongoing growth of our base business.", "Sales in China decreased 9% to $2.8 million due to a low level of promotional activities period-versus-period. In addition, China has experienced a much lower rate of growth for sales since the second half of fiscal 2012 due to some of the adverse economic conditions and slowing of some of the industrial activities throughout China at the time.", "Sales in the rest of Asia increased by 3% to $7.3 million in the first quarter. The region benefited from the growth of WD-40 Multi-Use Product through distributor markets, and those were markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and into India.", "That's it for the sales update for now. And I'll pass over to Jay who'll continue the review of the financials.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Garry, thanks. Just a reminder, in addition to the information that we're presenting on the call today, we'll suggest that you review our Form 10-Q, which will be filed tomorrow.", "Now a look at the rest of the financials. First, a quick review of our 50/30/20 rule. Those are the measures we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be at or above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is 30% or less. And then finally on to the 20, which represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is at or above or 50% and our cost of businesses 30% or less, our EBITDA will be at our target or above of 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q and in our investor presentations.", "First, a look at the gross margin or the 50. Gross margin in the first quarter was 50.1% compared to the 48.7% in the prior fiscal-year quarter. The increase of 140 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by price increases, lower promotional discounts and benefits from our supply chain-related initiatives. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher input costs and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.", "Let's look at input costs first. We experienced a net unfavorable impact of 30 basis points from our input costs. Impact -- the impact from changes in the cost of petroleum-based materials and aerosol cans combined unfavorably to impact our gross margin by 20 basis points. Most of the impact was related to the higher costs for aerosol cans. Changes in other input cost, including raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products as well as valves and other components, unfavorably impacted our margin by 10 basis points.", "Our sales price increases, which we consider and implement on a country-by-country basis, are focused on helping us offset the impact from input cost increases. Period-versus-period, our gross margin improved by 130 basis points as a result of price increases implemented over the past 12 months. Lower advertising and sales promotional discounts positively impacted our gross margin by 40 basis points. A lower percentage of sales during the current quarter was subject to promotional allowances compared to that in the prior year quarter. This was partially the result of lower sales mix in our homecare and cleaning products as well as lower promotional discounts on these products. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentives, trade promotions and discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales. The timing and magnitude of these can cause fluctuations in gross margin period-to-period.", "We achieved lower manufacturing costs from our local sourcing project in China as well as of the North American supply-chain project. The lower cost resulting from these initiatives positively impacted our margin by 50 basis points in the first quarter. China transitioned to local sourcing partway through fiscal year 2012. This quarter, the lower costs positively impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points.", "We began our North American supply-chain architecture project in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 with the goal to improve service delivery to our customers and to reduce the overall cost of our supply chain network. During the period of transition we have incurred additional cost to implement our new network and to reduce the number of our third-party packagers. In the quarter, any of the transition costs were more than offset by the savings we realized from lower manufacturing costs. The net savings related to the project positively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points this period versus prior period. While we expect to incur some additional transition costs during the remainder of the year, we expect that the lower cost envisioned from the new structure to result in a positive impact on gross margin for the year. We expect -- we experienced unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates within our European segment, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 60 basis points. Cost of product are sourced in pound sterling while revenues are generated in Europe, pound sterling and the dollar. Period-versus-period, the value of the euro deteriorated causing revenues from the euro-based countries to be worth less than pound sterling thus eroding the gross margin in parts of our Europe segment. All of the other miscellaneous impacts combined positively impacted our gross margin by 10 basis points.", "Now under the 30, or our cost of doing business. In the first quarter, the cost of doing business was 33% of net sales compared to 35% in Q1 of the prior fiscal year. Our goal is to have cost of doing business to be at or below 30%. Period-versus-period, our sales increased by 12% in Q1, while our operating expenses increased by 3% causing a decrease in our cost of doing business percentage.", "In the first quarter, approximately 71% of our cost of doing business came from 3 areas: 37% related to our people costs, or our investment in our tribe; 20% from our investments in marketing, advertising and promotion; and 14% related to freight costs, cost to get our products our customers.", "Now more details on our SG&A expenses. In Q1, our SG&A was $25.3 million versus the $22.6 million in the prior fiscal quarter. As a percentage of net sales, it was 26 -- 26.6% in both periods. We had higher employee costs of $1.9 million due to higher bonus expense accruals and higher compensation cost associated with annual merit increases and higher staffing levels. Other changes of note were freight expense, up by $0.4 million versus the prior period due to the higher sales. We also had increases in travel and meeting expenses, which were up $0.3 million period-versus-period. Overall, the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact.", "Advertising and sales promotion expense in Q1 was $6.1 million compared to $7.8 million in the prior-year period. As a percentage of sales, advertising and promotional investment was 6.4% in Q1 compared to 9.2% in the prior-year period. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expenses was primarily due to the timing of advertising and promotional activities in the Americas as well as a reduction in the Europe segment.", "Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively constant at $0.5 million in Q1 compared to the $0.6 million in the prior-year period. Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $31.9 million versus $31 million in Q1 of last year. Operating income in Q1 was $15.9 million compared to the $10.3 million in the prior-year quarter.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures, was 18% net sales in Q1 compared to 13% in the prior-year quarter. We target our EBITDA at 20% of net sales but expect variations from time to time as sales, advertising and promotional investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. Our EBITDA percentage is also affected by ongoing investments we make for future growth. The provision for net income tax in Q1 was 31% versus 31.6% in the prior fiscal-year quarter. The lower tax rate in the current quarter is primarily driven by the increasing proportion of the company's earnings, which are foreign and taxed at lower rates.", "Net income in Q1 was $10.9 million versus the $6.8 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net income. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.69 in Q1 compared to the $0.42 in the prior fiscal year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 16.2 million shares to 15.8 million shares.", "Regarding our dividend, on December 11, the Board of Directors declared a 7% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, increasing the dividend from $0.29 per share to $0.31 per share. The dividend will be payable on January 31, 2013 to shareholders of record on January 7. Based on today's closing price of $47.77, the annualized dividend yield would be 2.6%.", "A look at our financial position at November 30. We have a solid financial foundation that continues to support our strategic initiatives. It allows us to meet our working capital needs as well as help us weather the uncertainties in the capital markets and the global economy. Our strong balance sheet is supported by a large cash balance and low debt, and our growing and diversified revenues enable us to support our growth initiatives, which include market expansion and new product introductions.", "Our net cash position decreased from $24.7 million in -- at August 31, to $7.4 million at the end of Q1, primarily as a result of purchases of short-term investments and treasury stock under our share repurchase plan. Net cash is based on cash and cash equivalents less our outstanding debt. At November 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $52.4 million and we had $21.9 million in short-term investments. These consist of term deposits and callable time deposits held in money center banks. Our debt in both periods was $45 million from our existing line of credit.", "Yesterday, you might note that we amended our line of credit with the Bank of America. The amendment extends the maturity to a 5-year term and increases the commitment to an amount not to exceed $125 million. The new maturity date for the revolving facility is January 7, 2018. In addition, the LIBOR margin also decreased to 85 basis points.", "At WD-40 Company, we focus on the balance between investing for the future and returning capital to our shareholders. We provide cash to our shareholders through regular dividends. We target our dividend payout at 50% of net income, and this is our third consecutive year of dividend increases. We also return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we acquired a little over 171,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $8.1 million. These shares were acquired under our most recent share repurchase plan approved by the Board of Directors on December 13, 2011 and it provides authorization to acquire up to $50 million of the company's outstanding shares through the planned end date of December 12, 2013. Through November 30, 2012, the company had repurchased 634,000 shares at a total cost of $29.3 million. We expect to continue executing on our share repurchase program through the remainder of the year.", "That completes the financial overview. Again, more information is available in our Form 10-Q, which we'll file tomorrow.", "Thank you, and now back to Gary.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Great. Thanks, Jay. There are several macroeconomic factors that impact our outlook as well as our progress towards our strategic initiatives. We are cautiously optimistic about the macroeconomic factors, which include the stability in the global economy, major input costs and foreign exchange rates. In terms of sales and global -- and the global economy, we feel the growth of our WD-40 Multi-Use Product and the WD-40 Specialist product line will overcome possible slower growth and uncertainties that could be in China or in Europe. We expect that our multi-year purpose maintenance products will also offset any decreases that may occur in homecare and cleaning products. As for import costs, we hope that the recent stability in petroleum-based materials and aerosol can costs will continue in the near-term and that our initiatives will help us maintain, if not grow, our gross margin.", "We now, again, look back at our guidance, which remains unchanged from what we shared with you in October and at the annual shareholder meeting just in December. The following fiscal year 2013 guidance does not include any acquisition activity and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels. We expect fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $356 million to $370 million or growth of between 4% and 8% versus fiscal year 2012. We project gross margin to be close to 50%. We expect our global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 7% to 8% of net sales. We expect net income to be in the range of $36.5 million to $38 million, which would achieve a diluted earnings-per-share of between $2.31 and $2.40, that would assume that there were 15.8 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "So, as we sum up, what did you hear from us in the call today? You heard that we grew global sales by 12% versus the prior-year period driven by higher sales and increased distribution of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product and the Specialist product line. You heard it was the best revenue quarter in the company's history. You heard that we realized cost savings from our local sourcing initiatives in China and our North American supply chain architecture project both which helped us reach our goal of a minimum of 50% gross margin. You heard that we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, including shipping out the first orders for WD-40 BIKE, the development of new formulations and the launch of the WD-40 Specialist motorbike in the U.K. later in fiscal year 2013. You heard that we grew our diluted earnings per share from $0.42 to $0.69 per share, and we have increased our regular quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.31 per share. You heard that our outlook is cautiously optimistic and that we are maintaining our guidance and our sales growth of 4% to 8% for this year coming. You heard that there are very exciting times at WD-40. And in closing I'd like to share one of my very favorite quotes with you from Nelson Mandela, \"It always seems impossible until it's done.\"", "Thanks for joining us today. We'd be pleased to now open the conference and take any of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Liam Burke of Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Garry, could you talk a little bit about the core WD-40 brand in the U.S.? It looked like you had healthy sales. It looked like you got a little benefit from Specialist but WD-40 seems to be chugging along pretty well. What's driving that? I mean, typically there'd be some promotion behind it or the re -- an introduction of Smart Straw. It -- what is stepping up with this double-digit growth rate?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Well, again, we are looking at this, Liam, as you rightly identified, as the WD-40 brand. So we talk about it as being WD-40 Multi-Use Product, which is the blue and yellow can with the little red top. WD-40 Specialist which is our new product line, and then, of course, WD-40 BIKE, which had very little. Certainly, WD-40 Specialist did contribute to our growth of the brand in the U.S., in the first quarter. We do feel we may have got some lift from the core brand because of that also. Liam, if you go to our Investor Presentation, you'll see now there's a new slide in there that talks about physical awareness, and it's a picture of a shelf. And you'll see now how the brand has a lot more overall dominance now that we've got both of those products in the distribution. And then the core product, we just had a good quarter. We have -- had some good promotional activity going on across-the-board. We saw good activity in both the industrial and the home improvement trade channels. So it was one of those quarters that things played out a little better than we probably expected them to.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Just to touch on that last point, though. I mean, if you're looking at home improvement and industrial, I mean, would you expect that to have had some momentum there or, I mean, you're just looking at saying, \"Okay, we just had a good quarter here.\"", "Garry O. Ridge", "We don't see that this is absolutely abnormal but, again, it will depend on how things pan out going forward. But it seems -- if you look at some of the retail numbers that we've been getting out of home improvement, they seem to be reasonably better than they've been in the past. So I think that whole area is reasonably bland -- not bland, but at least it's not suffering at the moment. So we, overall, expect to have a good year around the core of our business, which is multi-purpose maintenance products driven by global expansion of the core product and the continued development of WD-40 Specialist.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Great. And Europe performed well, as you pointed out, getting some sales that have been deferred from fourth quarter. China was off this year -- this quarter, excuse me. Do you anticipate any kind of catch up in the subsequent quarters this year?", "Garry O. Ridge", "We're in -- as you know, Liam, we're at -- in China for the long haul. And we've shared before that China will bounce around, quarter-to-quarter, probably more than anywhere else as we continue to develop that market. But we feel that we'll grow again in China this year as we have every other year for the last 7, since we've started there, and we've got our eyes on that $100 million that we think is in China sometime in the future.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joseph Altobello of Oppenheimer.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Christina [ph], in for Joe. I was just wondering if you could, at all, quantify the sales shift in the quarter?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I'm sorry?", "Unknown Analyst", "I was hoping you could quantify the sales shift in the quarter?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Did that -- you mean from the sales shift from Q4 to Q1?", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes.", "Garry O. Ridge", "We haven't identified that, but if you would recall when we talked about it last time, we said that the sales shift that we felt would probably be mainly in Europe. If you look at Europe, it grew about $5 million, quarter-over-quarter. So the shift would probably be some part of that.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. Great. And then my next question was the impact from Hurricane Sandy, did you have anything from there?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No. Nothing that we could say that was material. We were certainly saddened that it happened. Though I'm sure there were some WD-40 used later on but we haven't -- there's nothing that we could point to.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will go to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "How large is your -- or how large do you intend to grow your Specialist product line, say, for 2013 or 2014?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Jeff, we believe that Specialist can be a meaningful part of our Multi-Use Product business. We haven't disclosed our targets overall, but we believe that from some of the early testing we did with the 3-IN-ONE brand in France and understanding what portion of our Multi-Use Product business could -- a well executed flanker brand strategy, wearing the shield be, we believe that will be a meaningful growth road for us for a number of years to come. And certainly, in the first year, it's proving out to fulfill that goal.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "As far as your China strategy, do you wait for the Chinese economy to improve or do you have a means of growing that business in 2013?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Oh no, we will continue to grow. The -- I think that the bouncing around over there, Jeff, is purely that. Our strategy in China is to make the end-user aware and make it easy to buy. And we're doing that by identifying geographically the industrial regions that have high consumptions of our type of product. In fact, this time next week I'll be visiting Foxconn in Shenzhen, who are user of our product. But we think that it's just a matter of -- as we've done in many other markets, as you would recall having followed us for many years, Jeff, it's a step-by-step basis that's very disciplined. We think China is a $100 million market in the future sometime down the road. And we're just going to continue like the steam roller, we just keep coming on it and we'll continue to build it.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then lastly, of the coming 3 quarters, which are the quarters that you think will have the highest promotional activity, and which ones do you think would have the lower promotional activity, as best as you can tell?", "Garry O. Ridge", "It's -- Jeff, it's really hard to predict because sometimes that is not necessarily under our control depending on when we move promotions around. But we do know that we will fall in between our 7% and 8% for the whole year. But today, it's a lot harder. We're in so many geographic markets, and timing is different in each one. So it would be very difficult to give you a meaningful prediction.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, how about the next quarter? Is that a high promotional quarter or a low one, or you can't tell?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I think it'll probably be in kind of line with a normal promotional quarter.", "Operator", "And there appear to be no further questions. So I'll turn it back over to management for any closing or additional comments.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thank you very much, everybody. We have nothing. We'll wish you a good afternoon, and we'll talk to you again sometime in April. All the best. Cheers.", "Operator", "And, once again, that concludes our call. Thank you, all, for joining today."]}

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. Today, we are pleased to have Garry Ridge, President and CEO; and Jay Rembolt, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company's outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results. These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, including the impact of commodity prices, the impact of introducing new product lines and fluctuating global market condition, both in the United States and internationally.", "The company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the company to have a reasonable basis.

Our third quarter fiscal year '13 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, July 8, 2013.", "At this time, I'd like to pass this call on to Garry Ridge.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thanks, Maria. Good day, and thanks for joining us for today's conference call. Today, we reported net sales of $86.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 1% over Q2 of last fiscal year. Year-to-date net sales were $182 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year period and within the range of our current annual revenue growth guidance of 4% to 8%. Net income for the second quarter was $10.5 million compared to $10.6 million in Q2 last year, and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.66 compared with $0.65 for the same period last year. Year-to-date, net income was $21.4 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year period and year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $1.35, up from $1.07 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Before we focus on more detail on the sales results, I'd like to provide an update on how we're doing against our strategic initiatives through the second quarter. Strategic initiative #1 is to maximize the WD-40 brand. Sales of WD-40 multi-use product increased by 6% in the second quarter compared with Q2 of last fiscal year. We grew sales over 20% in our Europe and Asia-Pacific trading blocks and from Q2 of last fiscal year, and Q2 of this year was primarily due to the ongoing growth of our base business.", "Strategic driver #2, which is to be a global leader in the company's categories and products within our prioritized platforms. We were happy to celebrate WD-40 Specialist's 1-year anniversary this quarter. If you haven't taken a look at WD-40 Specialist, Page 15 on our IR PowerPoint presentation, which is currently posted on our website, will give you a view of the complete range of current Specialist product in the United States.  We celebrated our success, which was a launch of the U.S. and the Europe direct markets in the second quarter of last year, and WD-40 Specialist has contributed incremental sales and is solidifying our leadership position in the marketplace.", "Strategic driver #3, which is around strategic business relationships. We continued working on the building blocks for our long-term sales growth during the second quarter. We did not find any acquisition opportunities that met our criteria in the second quarter, but we continue to explore partnerships for our next generation of WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE products. Strategic business relationships enable us to go to market faster with less -- with more expertise and less risk.", "Our strategic driver #4, which is global innovation efforts. Within the U.S. we launched 3 new SKUs under the WD-40 Specialist product line and made progress towards the development of the new WD-40 Specialist Lawn and Landscape product line which will be launched in fiscal year 2004 (sic) [2014]. In the U.K., we prepared our upcoming launch for WD-40 Specialist motorbike products, which are expected to ship in the third quarter of this fiscal year. These products will meet maintenance and repair needs among motorcycle enthusiasts and mechanics for uses in their garages, or in the workshop, or even at motorcycle racing events.", "During the second quarter, we also continued to build our user trial base and awareness of WD-40 Bike products. We were invited to provide bike support at the world-renowned UCI Cyclocross World Championships, which were held in the U.S. for the first time in January. This event gave us exposure to bike enthusiasts and pro cyclists worldwide.  On that headwind, the largest bike products distributor in the U.S. began marketing our products online, directly to independent bike dealers. We also prepared for additional SKU launches, which are expected in this third quarter.", "Our strategic initiative #5 is about our people. Last, but not least, under our fifth strategic initiative, we continue to attract, develop and retain tribe members to execute on our vision. In the second quarter, we announced our think big initiative, which entails kind of the realigning of our tribe to better achieve our specific strategic goals. The realignment included creating innovation teams at the trade block level and providing opportunities for our sales and marketing tribe, who are currently focused on homecare and cleaning products, to be able to be available for support customer and customer initiatives under our multi-purpose maintenance product platforms.", "That completes the update of our strategic initiatives. So let's move on to the details of our second quarter sales -- results starting with sales. While sales grew only grew 1% in the quarter due to decreases in sales in the Americas, they grew 6% year-to-date and we expect our sales growth for the full year to be in the 4% to 8% range as per our prior guidance. Sales of multi-purpose maintenance products categories accounted for 87% of our global sales in the second quarter, with the category up 6% in Q2 and up 11% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year periods. Products under this category include WD-40 and the 3-IN-ONE brand, as well as immaterial sales from BLUE WORKS brand, which are being transitioned to the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "By trade block, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products in Q2 were down 8% in the Americas, up 19% in Europe and up 20% in Asia-Pacific compared to the prior-year period. Homecare and cleaning products accounted for 13% of global net sales in Q2, with the category sales down 23% in Q2 and down 14% year-to-date. Brands under these categories include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, No Vac, 1001, X-14, Lava and Solvol. By trading blocks, sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the second quarter were down 28% in the Americas, down 14% in Europe and up 6% in Asia-Pacific.", "Now on to our results by segment, and let's start off in the Americas. Sales in the Americas segment decreased 13% in the second quarter and are down 1% year-to-date versus the prior-year periods. The segment accounted for 46% of global sales in Q2 compared to 53% in the prior-year period. Multi-purpose maintenance products sales were down 8% in Q2, but they are up 5% year-to-date. Homecare and cleaning product sales were down 28% in Q2 and are down 19% year-to-date. The decline in both categories was driven by lower sales, particularly in the United States. Total U.S. sales were down 17% in Q2 and down 3% year-to-date, driven by lower sales of homecare and cleaning products.", "In the second quarter, sales of Carpet Fresh, Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes, declined 54%, 33% and 30%, respectively. Some of these declines were due to our strategic roadmap to reduce business in low margin products, which require significant trade discounts, while others stem from decreased promotional or reduced programs, some competitive activity and category declines within the warehouse, club and mass retail channels.", "Lower sales in the U.S. during the second quarter also stemmed from multi-purpose maintenance products, which declined 11% at quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by a change in promotional activity completely. We conducted a significant promotional program with a key customer during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 that was not repeated in the second quarter of the fiscal year. Year-to-date, multi-purpose maintenance product sales in the U.S. are on a positive trajectory, with growth of 5%.", "Sales in Latin America were up 5% in Q2 and are up 6% year-to-date driven by higher WD-40 sales in distributor markets. Sales in Canada increased 2% in both quarter and year-to-date, primarily due to higher sales of 2000 Flushes and 3-IN-ONE. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales in this region.", "Now let's fly over the pond to Europe. Sales in the European segment were up 16% in both Q2 and are up 16% year-to-date, as compared to the prior fiscal year periods. Changes in foreign currency rates had a favorable impact on sales year-to-date. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased 13% in the second quarter versus 16%. This segment accounted for 38% of our global sales in Q2 compared to 33% in the prior fiscal year period.  We sell into Europe through a combination of both direct operations in certain countries, as well as through exclusive geographic marketing distributors in other countries. Sales in our European direct markets were up 14% in Q2 and are up 18% year-to-date. We attribute the increase to new distribution, a higher level of replenishment orders from improved economic stability, as well as a -- some small price increases implemented during the quarter in certain markets.", "We sell-through these exclusive independent marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern and Middle Eastern and African geographies, with virtually all of the sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. These markets, called our distributor markets, in total were up 20% in Q2 and are up 14% year-to-date. The distributor markets accounted for 31% of Europe sales in Q2 compared to 30% in the prior fiscal year period. Sales increased in all 3 distributor markets, due to the continued growth of our base business, as well as the introduction and sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "Let's hop over to Asia-Pacific. Sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were up 18% in the second quarter and up 10% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 16% of global sales in Q2, up from 14% in the prior fiscal year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates period versus period did not have a material impact on sales. Sales in the Australian operation increased 6% in Q2 and 10% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year periods. The sales growth was attributed to stable economic conditions and the ongoing growth of our base business.", "Sales in China increased 10% in the second quarter and remained relatively constant year-over-year. The increase in the second quarter was driven by a higher level of promotional activity period versus period, as well as price increase implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Our long-term execution approach is working well in China as we make WD-40 multi-use products more aware and easier to buy for our end-users in our target market segments. Sales throughout the rest of Asia increased 31% in Q2 and 15% year-to-date. The increase was due to continued growth of WD-40 multi-use product throughout the distributor markets and some worth noting were good performances in Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore.", "That's it for the strategy and sales update. And now over to Jay, who will continue the review with some of our financial details. Thanks, Jay.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Garry, thank you. In addition to the information that we'll present on the call today, we suggest that you review our 10-Q, which we'll file on Monday, April 8.", "As we quickly look to the rest of our financials, let's first stop at our 50/30/20 rule. As you may recall, the 50 represents gross margin which we target to be at or above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses with the exclusion of depreciation and amortization. Our target for that is 30% or less. And then finally, the 20 represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is at or above the 50% and our cost of business is 30% of less, our EBITDA will be at or above our target 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q and in our investor presentations.", "Now looking at the 50%, our gross margin in the second quarter was 50.9% compared to the 49.0% in the prior fiscal year period. The 190 basis point increase was primarily driven by price increases with -- along with lower promotional discounts, along with benefits from supply chain related initiatives. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher input costs and the end favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.", "Looking at the more detail, we experienced unfavorable impact of 20 basis points from our major input costs. Impact from changes in the cost of petroleum-based products and our aerosol cans combined to unfavorably impact our margin by 10 basis points. Much of the impact was related to the higher cost for aerosol cans. Changes in other input costs, including raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products, as well as valves and other components across our product lines unfavorably impacted our margin by 10 basis points period versus period.", "Sales price increases, which we consider and implement on a country-by-country basis to help offset the impact of input cost increases, we -- in the period versus period, our gross margin improved by 90 basis points as a result of price increases that we've implemented over the past 12 months. Our lower advertising and promotional discounts positively impacted our gross margin in the quarter by 90 basis points. A lower percentage of sales was subject to promotional discount compared to the prior year quarter, and this is primarily the result of lower sales mix in our homecare and cleaning products, as well as lower promotional discounts on these products themselves. The cost of our promotional activities, such as sales incentives, trade promotions, coupon offers, cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction in sales. The timing and the magnitude of these typically cost fluctuations in gross margin period to period.", "Now we'll look at the impact of our major initiatives on our cost of goods. We achieved lower manufacturing costs from our local sourcing project in China, as well as the North American supply chain project. The lower cost result from these initiatives resulted in a positive impact on gross margin of 40 basis points. China transitioned to local sourcing partway through fiscal 2012. The lower costs that we've been able to achieve from that transition had a positive benefit of 30 basis points in the current quarter.", "We began our North American supply chain architecture project in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, with a goal of improving service delivery to our customers and reducing our overall costs of our network. During the period of transition, we've incurred additional cost to implement the new network, as well as reduce the number of our third-party suppliers.", "In the current quarter, transition costs were more than offset by the savings we realized from the lower manufacturing -- for lower manufacturing costs. The net savings related to the project positively impacted our gross margin 10 basis points in this period compared to the prior year. We completed the majority of transition activities at the end of Q2, and we're expecting that the lower net costs under the new structure to begin resulting in a net positive impact on margin going forward.", "We experienced an unfavorable impact on margin as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates within our European segment and the impact was a negative 20 basis points on gross margin. Cost of goods are sourced in pound sterling, while revenues in that segment are generated in euros, pound sterling and the dollar. Period versus period, the value of the euro deteriorated, causing revenues from the euro-based countries to be worth less in pound sterling, thus eroding the gross margin in parts of our European segment.", "All other miscellaneous impacts combined positively impacted our gross margin by 10 basis points for the second quarter. The themes that we just discussed for the quarter related to gross margin also applied to the year-to-date results, where gross margin year-to-date was 50.5% compared to the 48.8% in the prior fiscal year period. The 170-basis-point increase was driven by price increases, lower promotional discounts, along with benefits achieved form the supply chain initiatives.", "That completes the gross margin discussion, now let's move on to the 30% or our cost of doing business. In the second quarter, the cost of doing business was 33% of net sales compared to 31% in Q2 of the prior fiscal year. Our goal is to have the cost of doing business to be at or below 30%. Period versus period, our sales increased by 1% in Q2, while our operating expenses increased by 8%, causing a decrease in our cost of doing business percentage. Year-to-date, the cost of doing business was 33% of net sales, the same as the prior year period. Approximately 71% of the cost of doing business came from 3 areas: Our people, our investments in marketing and promotion and freight costs, of which people costs were 40%, 18% for our investments in marketing and promotion and 13% to get our products to our customers.", "Now a little more detail on the SG&A expenses. In the second quarter, our Q2 -- our SG&A was $24 million versus the $21.9 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. As a percent of net sales, it was 27.6% in the current quarter versus 25.5% in the prior-year period. We had higher employee costs of $2.4 million, due to higher bonus expense accruals and higher compensation costs associated with annual merit increases and higher staffing levels. This was partially offset by lower freight costs and lower professional service costs as well.", "SG&A expense year-to-date was $49.3 million versus $44.5 million in the prior fiscal year period. As a percent of sales, it was 27.1% in the year-to-date period versus 26.1% in the prior year period. Advertising sales promotion expense in Q2 was $5.3 million compared to $4.9 million in the prior year period. As a percent of sales, A&P investment was 6.1% in Q2, up from the 5.8% in the prior year period. The increase in advertising and sales promotional expense was related to increased activity in Europe and the Asia-Pacific segments.", "Year-to-date, our sales and -- our advertising and sales promotion expense was $11.3 million and was $1.5 million lower than the prior year period. Advertising and sales promotion expense as a percent of sales decreased to 6.2% year-to-date, down from the 7.5% in the prior year period. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expense was primarily due to lower costs associated with promotional programs that had been conducted in the Americas in the last year's period.", "Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively constant at $0.5 million in Q2 compared to $0.6 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date, amortization was $0.9 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior fiscal year period.  Our total operating expenses in the current quarter were $29.7 million versus the $27.4 million in the Q2 of last year. Operating income was $14.4 million, compared to $14.7 million in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, total operating expenses were $61.6 million versus $58.5 million last year.  Operating income year-to-date was $30.3 million, compared to the $25 million achieved in the prior fiscal year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50-30-20 measures, was 19% of sales in Q2, the same as the prior year period. Year-to-date, EBITDA was 18% to net sales compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year. We target EBITDA again at the 20% of net sales, but we do expect variations from time to time, as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities, as well as the fact that we do make investments out of this for future growth.  Other income in Q2 was $0.5 million due to foreign currency exchange gains compared to near 0 net gains and losses in the last year's period. Year-to-date, other income was $0.6 million, compared to other expense of $0.2 million in the prior year period. We experienced foreign currency exchange gains year-to-date compared to foreign currency exchange losses in the prior fiscal year period.", "The provision for income taxes in Q2 was 30.2% versus 28% in the prior fiscal year quarter. Year-to-date, the provision for income taxes was 30.6% versus the 29.5% in the prior fiscal year period. The lower tax rate in the prior year periods reflect benefits from the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with expiring statutes in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We did not have a similar benefit in the current fiscal year.  Net income in Q2 was $10.5 million versus $10.6 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.2 million favorable impact on net income. Q2 fiscal year 2013 results on a constant currency basis would have produced net income of $10.3 million.", "Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 in Q2, compared to $0.65 in the prior fiscal year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 16.1 million shares to 15.7 million shares in this period.  Year-to-date, net income was $21.4 million versus the $17.4 million in the prior year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.2 million favorable impact on net income for the year-to-date period as well. Year-to-date 2013 results, on a constant currency basis, would have produced net income of $21.2 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.35 year-to-date compared to $1.07 in the prior fiscal year period. And again, diluted shares outstanding decreased from 16.1 million to 15.7 million shares.", "Regarding the dividend, on March 19, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share payable on April 30, 2013, to shareholders of record on April 12, 2013. Based on today's closing price of $52.82, the annualized dividend yield would be 2.3%.", "A look at our financial position on February -- the end of February 28, 2013, we focus on maintaining a solid financial foundation that supports our strategic initiatives. Our strong balance sheet has healthy cash and short-term investment balances, low debt, and we have available additional liquidity under our $125 million line of credit. This enables us to pursue our key initiatives, market expansion, new product introductions.", "As of February 28, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were $45.6 million, a level that more than supports our working capital needs and provides us the ability to weather uncertainties in the capital markets and the global economy. We also had $29.8 million in short-term investments, which consist of term deposits and callable time deposits held in money center banks. Our line of credit balance increased slightly from $45 million at the end of 2012 to $50 million at the end of the current quarter.", "In addition to our regular dividends, which we target at a payout ratio of 50% of net income, we also return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. And during the second quarter, we acquired nearly 82,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $4.4 million. These shares were acquired under our latest share repurchase plan, which was approved by the Board of Directors on December 13, 2011.  It provides authorization to acquire up to $50 million of the company's outstanding shares through the plan's end date of December 12, 2013. Through February 28, 2013, the company has repurchased close to 716,000 shares at a total cost of $33.7 million. We expect to continue executing on this program throughout the remainder of the year.", "And that completes the financial overview. Much more information will be available in our 10-Q, which will be filed, again, on Monday. Thanks to you. And now back to Garry.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. Progress on our strategic initiatives, as well as several macroeconomic factors have impacted our outlook over time. We feel more prepared than ever to capitalize on the opportunities the global economy may present us. We'll not only benefit from some economic recovery or instability, but from our global leadership position, which is now in place around the world.", "We continue to focus our people and efforts on developing new multipurpose product offerings, and with the homecare and cleaning products category, continuing to represent a smaller portion of our business over time. While we have harvested our homecare and cleaning products to date, including reducing sales in low profit products and channels, we continue to experience volatility in -- and category declines. In March 2013, the Board of Directors authorized management to evaluate strategic alternatives for the homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment. To date, this evaluation is in its early stages and no decision has been made relative to future strategic plans for these brands.", "We are cautiously optimistic about several macro factors, which include stability in the global economy, major input costs and foreign exchange rates stabilizing. As for input costs, we hope that the recent stability in petroleum-based materials and aerosol can costs will continue in the near term and that our initiatives will help us maintain, if not grow, our gross margin.", "Our sales and net income guidance remains unchanged from October 2012. However, we are updating our earnings per share guidance based on our projected share repurchases. The following fiscal year 2013 guidance does not include acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to the recent levels.", "We expect our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $356 million to $370 million, or a growth of between 4% and 8% versus fiscal year 2012. We project our gross margin will be close to 50%. We expect our global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 7% and 8% of net sales. We expect net income of $36.5 million to $38 million, which would include -- which would achieve a diluted EPS of between $2.32 and $2.42, assuming 15.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "So let's sum up a little bit. What did you hear from us today? You heard that sales grew 1% during Q2 and that our sales growth of 6% year-to-date is on course with our current sales guidance. You heard that we celebrated the first anniversary of WD-40 Specialist product line with additional SKU launches in the United States. You heard that we continue our innovation efforts, as we prepare for the launch of WD-40 Specialist motorbike in the United Kingdom in the next quarter and WD-40 Specialist lawn and landscape in the U.S. in the early part of fiscal 2014.", "You heard we've realigned our talent to focus on trading block execution of the WD-40 Specialist category development and innovation program. You heard that cost savings from our local sourcing initiative in China and North American supply chain architecture project help us exceed our 50% gross margin target. You heard that we continue to return capital to shareholders by executing on our share buyback program. You heard that our outlook is cautiously optimistic and that we are maintaining our guidance with sales growth of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2013, and you heard that these are exciting times for tribe members and shareholders of WD-40 Company.", "In closing, as I normally do, I'd like to share a quote with you today. And this one's from Abraham Lincoln, \"To believe in the things you can see and touch is no belief at all, but to believe in the unseen is a triumph and a blessing.\"", "Thank you for joining us today. We'll be pleased to now open the call -- the conference, for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Just a few questions here, I guess. First, on Europe. You guys had a very good quarter here in Europe and you've had a few good quarters in Europe. You mentioned that you \"turned a corner,\" if you will, and it sounds like some of the growth you're seeing is from new market entry or new channel entry, but also a lot of the growth is base business growth. So could you give us a sense for what you're seeing on the ground in terms of overall macro activity in Europe? Are things really getting better at this point?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Yes, Joe, when they weren't so good in Europe, it wasn't really because our end users weren't buying our product, it was because there was a scare mentality in the distribution systems in Europe and our promotional activity was pared back as they were reducing inventories. We've seen 2 solid quarters now of that not reoccurring. We've got -- our promotional programs are solid. Our support of bicycling in Europe has been great. We've launched Specialist in Europe and it had a good launch around that. So God willing and the creek don't rise, we feel that we're back on to what has been our traditional double-digit growth pattern in Europe, which is continuing to make the end-user aware and make it easy to buy and putting more product in front of people who use more product where they shop.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And you mentioned Specialist, I wanted to go there next. You obviously put out 3 new products this quarter. Do you guys worry that the proliferation of new products, if you will, on that line complicates the category? Or are the uses that differentiated and unique? Because one of the things I think most consumers like about the base WD-40 product is how useful it is and how it does go from 1 category to the other in terms of its flexibility.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Absolutely. If you look at the 2 areas, firstly, if you look at retail, what it's doing on the retail shelves is getting us a much larger brand footprint. And the retail customer, the guy who uses $0.41 worth of WD-40 a year because he's mainly sitting on his shelf drinking his beer on the weekend, he's going to continue to buy WD-40 and use the MUP product just as he always has. Our heavier end users, the trades guys, the people who are DIYers and heavy users are already either using something in this area that is not the multi-use product. I'll give you a typical example, Joe. Let's assume that you are a big-time automotive DIYer. WD-40 is a great penetrant, but sometimes there are opportunities to penetrate, let's say, a manifold on an exhaust that's really pretty well stuck. Now the end result or the big answer to that might be hit it with a blue torch or you can use a better penetrant. And we -- one of our product lines is now the best-in-class 50 state VOC-free penetrant on the market. Other areas where we're going is there are products that WD-40 multi-use product doesn't compete with at all at the moment. One of those is our rust remover soap product, a product where you put rusty parts in a liquid and leave it for a couple hours overnight, take it out and the rust is gone. Another area is in the new lawn and landscaping area we're going into, which is a whole new range of products under the WD-40 brand, that WD-40 MUP does not solve any of those problems. So what we've looked at is, and in our investor presentation we've upgraded it a little bit, you'll see we've added some new slides that show you the platforms that we believe, through research, the brand has permission to go and then from that dropping down to categories, which are more the verticals of where we think we can go.", "Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, understood. And just one last one, I guess, on the strategic alternatives for homecare and cleaning in the Americas, how should we think about that? Or, actually, more importantly, how are you guys thinking about that in terms of how you're prioritizing, let's say things like earnings dilution versus the boost to growth that you would get from either divesting that business, or shutting it down or what-have-you?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Well, really, our position hasn't changed. We've said for a long time now that homecare and cleaning products are not long-term parts of our business and we've been harvesting from that. And when the time is right and when we feel it's right, we'll make a move to make them less part of our business. So -- and we would -- what we hope to be able to do that by supplementing the revenues with the growth that we're getting and we're going to get out of our Specialist product line or maybe an acquisition. But we're just really saying that we mean what we say. The homecare and cleaning products have done their job for us, where we love the revenue and the profitability of them still, but that's not where we're spending 1 strategic dollar. Our strategic dollars are being poured into our new platforms around the WD-40 brand. And the reason we're doing that now, is because we've now got the global infrastructure to be able to take more things to more people in more places faster.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thank you, everyone. We remind you that our investor presentation is on our website and that the 10-Q will be filed on Monday. And until we see you in person or in the next call, we wish you a pleasant afternoon. Good afternoon.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation."]}

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations for WD-40 Company, Ms. Maria Mitchell. You may begin.", "Maria M. Mitchell", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings call. Today, we are pleased to have Garry Ridge, President and CEO; and Jay Rembolt, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This conference call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40 Company's outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results.

Our fourth quarter fiscal year '13 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, October 17, 2013. And now I'd like to pass it on to Garry Ridge.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thank you, Maria. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today's conference call. Today, we've reported net sales of $93.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, an increase of 7% over Q3 last fiscal year. Year-to-date, net sales were $275.1 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year period. Net income for the third quarter was $10.3 million compared to $9.1 million in last fiscal year Q3. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.66 compared to $0.57 for the same period last fiscal year. Year-to-date net income was $31.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $2.01, up from $1.64 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Before we focus on the sales results, let's review the progress we've made during the third quarter towards our strategic initiatives, the first one being to maximize the WD-40 brand. Sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product increased 9% in the third quarter compared to Q3 last fiscal year. Apart from strong overall performance, growth was driven by major -- a major customer-specific promotional program in the U.S. and double-digit growth in our European distributor markets.", "Our second strategic driver is to be the global leader in the company's product categories within our prioritized platforms. WD-40 Specialist has contributed incremental sales and is solidifying our leadership position in the marketplace. We launched our new motorbike line in the U.K. during the third quarter. These products meet maintenance and repair needs among motorcycle enthusiasts and mechanics for uses in garage, workshops and motorcycle race events. Expansion into other markets is under consideration.", "Our third strategic driver is around building business relationships that impact favorably around our business. This encompasses acquisitions, partnerships and the strategic alternatives for our brands and products. We did not find acquisition opportunities that met our criteria in the third quarter, but we continue to work with partners to explore new product opportunities. We continue to evaluate our strategic alternatives for the Americas home, care and cleaning products during the third quarter. We are in the early stages and no decisions have been made relative to the future strategic plans for these home care and cleaning product brands.", "Our fourth strategic driver is around our global innovation efforts. During the quarter, we continue to research and develop new WD-40 Specialist products in the lawn and landscape segment. The products suite is designed to keep machine powered lawn equipment running and operating smoothly. The new product line is under consideration and may be launched in the U.S. during fiscal '14. During the third quarter, we also launched additional SKUs for WD-40 BIKE, not to be confused with motorbike. The go-to market strategy for WD-40 BIKE is different from our traditional model and retail channels, and we focus on the independent bike distributors. WD-40 BIKE products are specialized in cleaning, protecting and lubricating bikes.", "Our fifth strategic driver is our people development, last but in no ways least. Under our fifth strategic initiative, we continue to attract develop and retain tribe members to execute our vision. In the third quarter, we completed our think big reorganization by realigning our innovation teams at the trading block level and providing opportunities for our homecare and cleaning product sales and marketing tribe members, so they could also support customers and initiatives under our multipurpose maintenance products.", "That completes our strategic initiatives updates, so let's move on to a little more detail about our third quarter results starting with sales. Sales in the multipurpose maintenance products category accounted for 88% of global sales in the third quarter with category sales up 12% in Q3 and up 11% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year period. Products under the category include WD-40 in the 3-IN-ONE brands, as well as immaterial sales from BLUE WORKS brand, which is being transitioned now to the WD-40 Specialist product line. By trading blocks, sales of multipurpose maintenance products in Q3 were up 17% in the Americas, were up 10% in Europe, and up 1% in Asia Pacific compared to the prior year period. Homecare and cleaning products category accounted for 12% of our global sales in Q3 with the category down 18% in Q3 and down 15% year-to-date. Brands under this category include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, No Vac, 1001, X-14, Lava and Solvol. By trading blocks, sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the third quarter were down 21% in the Americas and down 16% in Europe and down 3% in Asia Pacific.", "Now I'd like to share some of the results around our performance, starting in the segment areas, starting with the Americas. Sales in the Americas segment increased 8% in the third quarter and were up 2% year-to-date versus the prior year period. This segment accounted for 51% of global sales in Q3 as compared to 50% in the prior year period. Total U.S. sales were up 9% in Q3 and up 1% year-to-date. Higher sales of our multipurpose maintenance products more than offset lower sales in homecare and cleaning products. Multipurpose maintenance product sales increased 18% in the third quarter, primarily due to a significant customer-specific promotion for the WD-40 Multi-Use Products that was not conducted in the prior fiscal year period. New and increased distribution of the WD-40 Specialist product line also contributed to the growth. Homecare and cleaning products sales decreased 22% in the third quarter, driven by Carpet Fresh, Spot Shot and our automatic toilet bowl cleaners, which declined by 48%, 29% and 12%, respectively. Homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows despite the sales decline, with a portion of the decline stemming from our decisions to reduce businesses in low margin products and programs, which require significant trade, discounts and promotions. Sales also declined due to the decrease in promotional programs, competitive and category declines, as well as the volatility of orders from -- within the warehouse club and mass retail channels. During the third quarter, the management team began to evaluate strategic alternatives for the homecare and cleaning products in the Americas segment. To date, no decision has been made relative to the future strategic plans for these brands.", "Sales in Latin America were up 15% in Q3 and up 9% year-to-date, driven by higher WD-40 sales throughout the region. Sales in Canada decreased by 4% in Q3 and were flat year-to-date. The sales decline in the third quarter was primarily due to lower sales of homecare and cleaning products in Canada. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Q3 or year-to-date sales.", "Now let's look at Europe. Sales in the Europe segment were up 8% in Q3 and are up 13% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year periods. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the third quarter, but did not have a material impact on the year-to-date sales. The segment accounted for 35% of global sales in both Q3 and the prior year fiscal period. We sell into Europe through a combination of direct operations in certain countries, as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in other countries. Sales now at European direct markets were down 2% in Q3 due primarily to the customer order flow and lower level of promotional activities period-versus-period, as well as some unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales in the direct markets are up or were up 11% year-to-date. We sell through exclusive independent marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe and the Middle East & Africa with virtually all sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. Our distributor markets in total were up 28% in Q3 and are up 18% year-to-date. The distributor market accounts for 40% of Europe's total sales in Q3 compared to 34% in the prior year fiscal period. Sales in all of the 3 distributor markets were due to the continued growth of our base business. Sales in Eastern and Northern Europe also benefited from the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "Now let's take a look at Asia Pacific. Sales in Asia Pacific were flat in the third quarter and are up 7% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 14% of global sales in Q3 versus 15% in the prior fiscal year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus period-to-period did not have a material impact on sales. Sales in Australia decreased 4% in Q3 and were up 5% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year period. The sales decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to a lower level of promotional activities and unfavorable impact on changes in foreign currency exchange rate period-to-period. Year-to-date sales growth was attributed to a higher level of promotional activities in the first half of fiscal year, as well as the ongoing growth of our base business.", "Sales in China decreased 14% in the third quarter and were down 6% year-to-date. The decrease in both periods is attributed to a lower level of promotional sales year-over-year, as well as lower economic growth in industrial activities in the region. Our development in China is a long-term strategy. We expect to see ups and downs in the short-term, but we are confident that over time we will build a significant market in China. Since opening our subsidiary, we have significantly grown the market, but there is plenty more growth to come in the years ahead. Sales in the rest of Asia increased 12% in Q4 and 14% year-to-date. The increase was due to continued growth of the WD-40 Multi-Use Products throughout the distributor markets, including those in Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines.", "That's the sales update. I'd now like to pass over to Jay, who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Garry, thanks. In addition to the information that we'll present today on the call, we also want to remind you to review our Form 10-Q, which we'll file tomorrow.", "Now let's look at the rest of the financials. But first, we stop and review our 50/30/20 rule, and this is what we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be at or above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target for this 30 is 30% or less. And then finally, the 20 represents EBITDA. If we keep our gross margin at or above 50% and our cost of business is 30% or less, our EBITDA will be at or above the 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in the 10-Q and in our investor presentations.", "Now we look at our gross margin over the 50. Gross margin in the third quarter was 51.3% compared to the 49.5% in the prior fiscal year period. The increase of 180 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by prior period price increases, lower promotional discounts, benefits from our supply chain related initiatives, as well as the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Let's start first with input costs.", "We experienced a net unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from the changes in input costs. Changes in the cost of petroleum-based materials and aerosol cans combined to favorably impact our margin by 10 basis points. This, however, was more than offset by changes in other input cost, which unfavorably impacted our margin by 20 basis points. These other import costs include raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products, as well as valves and other componentry for our multi-purpose maintenance products.", "Sales price increases are considered and implemented on a country-by-country basis to help us offset the impact from input cost increases. This period versus the prior period, our gross margin improved by 110 basis points as a result of price increases implemented over the past 12 months. Lower advertising and promotional discounts positively impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points. A lower percentage of sales during the current quarter was subject to promotional allowances compared to the prior year. This was primarily a result of lower sales mix in our homecare and cleaning products, as well as lower promotional discounts on these products. The cost of promotional activities, such as sales incentives, trade promotions, coupon offers and cash discounts that we give to our customers, are recorded as a reduction to sales. The timing and magnitude of these may cause fluctuations in our gross margin from period to period.", "Looking at the impact from our major initiatives on our cost of goods, we achieved lower manufacturing cost due to the North American supply chain restructuring project and our local sourcing project in China. The lower cost resulting from these initiatives positively impacted our margin by 40 basis points in the third quarter. China began transition to local sourcing halfway through fiscal 2012, and we continue to realize benefits in the current quarter. The lower manufacturing costs and transfer freight positively impacted our margin by 10 basis points this quarter. We began our North American supply chain architecture project in the first quarter of 2012.", "And now we've completed the majority of the transition activities. The goal for the project was to improve service delivery to our customers, also reduce the overall costs within our supply chain network. In the current quarter, transition costs were minimal and were more than offset by savings we realized from lower manufacturing fees. The net of this project positively impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points this period.", "We experienced a favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates within our European segment, which positively impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points. Cost of goods are sourced in pound sterling, while revenues are generated in euros, pound sterling, as well as some in the U.S. dollar. The value of the euro increased period-versus-period, causing revenues from euro-based countries to be more -- to be worth more in pound sterling, thus improving the gross margin. Sales mix in all other miscellaneous impacts negatively affected our gross margin by 20 basis points in the quarter. And this would also include the impact of higher sales from our lower margin distributor markets.", "The themes discussed for the quarter for gross margin also apply to year-to-date results. Gross margin year-to-date was 50.8% compared to 49.1% in the prior fiscal year. The increase of 170 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by the prior period price increases, lower promotional discounts, along with benefits from our supply-chain-related initiatives. This completes the gross margin discussion. Now on to the 30 or the cost of doing business.", "In the third quarter, the cost of doing business was 34% of net sales compared to 33% in Q3 of the prior year. Our goal is to have the cost of doing business at or below 30%. Period-versus-period, our sales increased by 7% in Q3, while our operating expenses increased by 10%, causing an increase in our cost of doing business percentage. Year-to-date, the cost of doing business was 33% of net sales, the same as in the prior year period. In the third quarter, approximately 78% of our cost of doing business came from 3 areas: 45% was related to our people costs, the investments in our tribe; 21% is from our investments that we make in marketing and advertising and promotion; and 12% in freight, the cost to get our products to our customers.", "Now on a little bit more detail of our SG&A expenses. In the quarter, in Q3, our SG&A expense was $25.7 million versus $22.7 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. As a percentage of net sales, it was 27.6% in the current quarter versus 26.1% in the prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by higher employee cost, which increased $3.3 million due to a higher bonus expense accruals along with higher compensation costs associated with annual merit increases and higher staffing levels. This was partially offset by lower professional services and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales -- SG&A expense year-to-date was $74.9 million versus $67.3 million in the prior fiscal year period. As a percent of net sales, it was 27.2% in the current year period versus 26.1% in the prior year. Advertising and sales promotion expense in Q3 was slightly lower at $6.6 million compared to $6.7 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of sales, A&P investment was 7.1% in Q3 compared to 7.7% in the prior year period. A higher level of advertising and promotional activities in Europe was more than offset by the lower activities in Asia Pacific, as well as lower cost in the Americas. Year-to-date advertising and sales promotion expense of $18 million was $1.5 million lower than the prior year fiscal period. Advertising and sales promotion expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 6.5% year-to-date from 7.5% in the prior period. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expense was primarily due to the lower costs associated with promotional programs conducted in the Americas segment. Amortization of intangible assets in the current quarter remains constant at $0.5 million compared to the prior fiscal year period. Year-to-date amortization was $1.5 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year period. Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $32.8 million versus $29.9 million in Q3 of last financial year. Operating income in Q3 was $15 million compared to $13.1 million in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date total operating expenses were $94.4 million versus $88.4 million in the prior year period. Operating income year-to-date was $45.3 million compared to the $38.1 million in the prior year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures, was 17% of net sales in Q3 compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year period. Year-to-date EBITDA was 18% of net sales compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year. Again, we target EBITDA of 20% of net sales, but expect variations from time to time as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. Our EBITDA percentage is also in fact affected by investments we make for our future growth. The provision for income taxes in Q3 was 30.6% versus 29% in the prior fiscal year quarter. Year-to-date, the provision for income taxes was also 30.6% versus 29.3% in the prior year period. The lower tax rate in both year periods reflect benefits from the release of uncertain tax position reserves that were associated with the expiring statutes in fiscal year 2012. We did not have a similar benefit in the current fiscal year.", "Net income in Q3 was $10.3 million versus $9.1 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.2 million unfavorable impact on net income. Q3 fiscal year 2013 results on a constant currency basis would have produced net income of $10.6 million. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.66 in Q3 compared to $0.57 in the prior fiscal year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 16 million shares to 15.6 million shares. Year-to-date net income was $31.7 million compared to $26.5 million in the prior year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net income. Diluted earnings per share were $2.01 year-to-date compared to $1.64 in the prior year period, with diluted shares outstanding decreasing from 16.1 million shares to 15.7 million shares. Regarding the dividend on June 18, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 a share payable on July 31, 2013, to shareholders of record on July 16. Based on today's closing price of $57.65, the annualized dividend yield would be 2.2%.", "A look at our financial position at May 31. We have a strong solid financial foundation to support our strategic initiatives. Our balance sheet is supported by strong cash and short-term investment balances, low debt and additional liquidity is available under our $125 million line of credit. This enables us to pursue our growth initiatives, which include market expansion and new product introductions. As of May 31, our cash and cash equivalents were $52.3 million, an adequate level to support working capital needs, as well as enough to weather fluctuations in the capital markets and the global economy. We also had $35.2 million in short-term investments, which consist of term deposits and callable time deposits held at money center banks. Our line of credit balance was $63 million at the end of the third quarter. In addition to our regular dividends, which we target a payout ratio of 50% of net income, we also returned capital to shareholders through share repurchases. During the third quarter, we acquired just over 182,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $9.8 million. These shares were acquired under our share repurchase plan approved by the Board of Directors on December 13, 2011, which provides authorization to acquire up to $50 million of the company's outstanding shares through the plan's end date of December 12, 2013. As of May 31, the company has repurchased nearly 898,000 shares at a total cost of $43.5 million. We expect to complete the repurchases under this plan before the end of the year and begin purchases under a new share repurchase plan that was approved by the Board of Directors on June 18. The new plan provides authorization to acquire up to an additional $60 million of the company's shares through August of 2015. Well, that completes the financial overview. Again, more information is available in our 10-Q, which we'll file tomorrow. And now back to Garry.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. We remain cautiously optimistic about several macro factors, which include stability in the global economy, major import costs and foreign currency exchange rates. As for import cost, we hope that recent stability in petroleum-based materials and aerosol can cost will continue in the near term and that our initiatives will continue to benefit our gross margin. We have updated our guidance in light of our year-to-date results. The following fiscal year 2013 guidance does not include any acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels. We expect our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $356 million to $370 million or a growth of between 4% and 8% versus fiscal 2012. We now project our gross margin to be close to 51%. We expect our global advertising and promotion investment to be in the range of 6.5% and 7.5% of net sales. We now expect net income of between $37.6 million and $39 million, which would achieve a diluted earnings per share of between $2.40 and $2.48, assuming 15.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "So in summary, what did you hear from us on this call today? You heard that sales grew 7% in Q3 and year-to-date, driven by the growth of -- in our multi -- WD-40 Multi-Use Product and Specialist product lines. You heard that we launched WD-40 Specialist Motorbike in the U.K. in the third quarter and are working on other WD-40 Specialist category offerings to bring to market during next fiscal year. You heard that cost savings from the North American supply chain architect project and our local sourcing initiative in China helped us to achieve our 51% gross margin. You heard that we continue to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and that the board approved another $60 million share repurchase plan. You heard that we raised our guidance for fiscal 2012 with diluted EPS now in the range of $2.40 and $2.48. You heard that these are exciting times for our tribe members and shareholders at WD-40 Company.", "In closing, I'd like to share a quote with you from Nelson Mandela: \"It always seems impossible until it's done.\" Thank you for joining us today. We'll now pause and be pleased to open the conference for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Garry, could you talk a little bit more about the distribution channel in Europe? I mean, that was up a big number. Is there any particular country or are there any new countries online or what's driving that number?", "Garry O. Ridge", "The marketing, distributor markets in Europe, it's across the board, Liam. We've had development in -- continuing in the Eastern European blocks, our business in Russia and Poland and other areas. But there is no new news. It's just another step in the build of that business. It does, as you know, as with most of our business, it does bounce around from time to time, but we're happy that -- it was a good quarter, but we're more than happy that it's a good year.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And you mentioned more applications for the multi-purpose marketing. You mentioned multi-purpose lubricant side. The motorbike sales in U.K., bike sales in U.S. and in the lawn-and-garden potential launch, when you're dealing with more specialized distribution, do you have to approach that market differently than you traditional know how to go after the market, where you're dealing with much more retailers?", "Garry O. Ridge", "It depends on the geography and what our competencies are. We have set up a separate division in the United States to handle the distribution to the independent bike dealers because it is quite different. And that's been operating now for about a year. In the United Kingdom with our motorbike product, we are selling both through the traditional motorbike distribution through wholesalers that are experienced in that trade channel. We're also selling our motorbike range in the U.K. through automotive distribution because motorcyclists do ride into motorcycle stores. As far as the potential for lawn-and-garden, it will be sold through our traditional trade channels in hardware home improvement, where those stores have sections within their units that sell these types of products. And then the other specialist range, which is the, what we call our flanker brand strategy, which are the products of that we launched initially. Of course, they are going through our regular distribution, through mass merchants, hardware home improvements, automotive and industrial.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And, Jay, debt stepped up about $18 million this year. Is that just to provide you additional cash because of the international holding?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Yes, yes.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Now do you see having to continue that? Or, I mean, do you feel comfortable that you have sufficient cash balance?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "While we would see our line of credit expanding gradually over time as we continue to generate cash that's -- majority of it being held offshore, so in some ways we would continue to see ourselves in a kind of a net cash position, but we would continue to see some level of increase in our line of credit.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Christina on for Joe tonight. I had a question about gross margin and why you're more optimistic about it for the remainder of the year.", "Garry O. Ridge", "The main reason we're optimistic about it is it's trending now year-to-date at nearly 51%. So we don't see that deteriorating for the rest of the year. So it's really a reflection of reality.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And the change in A&P for the year, what was the reasoning behind that?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Again, it's basically the way it's trended for the year and how the year has unfolded. It seems like it will come in a little lower than normal mainly due to the shift in advertising investment or marketing investment. So again, it's just truing it up to reflect, really, the reality of where it is today.", "Unknown Analyst", "So we shouldn't expect that, going forward, past of this year?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I don't want to comment on that. We've traditionally been in that 6% to 8% range for many years. We don't see that that's going to change, but it will be somewhere within that, depending on the promotional activity and what's happening at that time.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, great. And then just one last one, excluding the specialist product, how much was the base WD-40 brand up?", "Garry O. Ridge", "We only -- we don't disclose WD-40 Multi-Use Product on its own. We report WD-40 as a brand, which includes multi-use product and specialist.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Garry Ridge for any additional or closing remarks.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Well, thank you. That was short and sweet. We hope you have a pleasant rest of the day, and we'll talk to again in October. Cheers.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

Joining me today on the call is Jay Rembolt, our Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.", "", "This call contains forward-looking statements concerning WD-40's outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results. These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, including the impact of commodity prices, the impact of the introduction of new product lines and the fluctuation of global market conditions, both in the United States and internationally.

Today, we reported net sales of $93.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, an increase of 10% over Q4 last fiscal year. Year-to-date net sales were $368.5 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year period. Net income for the third quarter -- fourth quarter was $8.1 million compared to $9 million in Q4 last year. The diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.53 compared to $0.56 for the same period last year. Year-to-date net income was $39.8 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year period. And year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $2.54, up 15% from $2.20 in the prior fiscal year.", "", "Before we focus on the sales results, let me review the progress we've made towards our strategic initiatives. Our first strategic initiative in 2013 was to maximize the WD-40 brand. Fiscal year 2013 marks the company's 60th anniversary. And while WD-40 Multi-Use Product has been a household staple for decades, we actually see ourselves as a growth company and performance this year supports that perspective. Sales of the WD-40 brand increased by 16% in the fourth quarter and 13% year-to-date compared to fiscal 2012. The growth was driven by increased distribution and promotional activities on our multi-use product in Europe and China, as well as new distribution of the Specialist product line in the U.S. and Europe. We are excited that all the product lines under the WD-40 brand experienced growth year-over-year.", "", "The second strategic initiative was to be the global leader in the company's product categories within our prioritized platforms. We experienced distribution and -- sorry, we expanded distribution of our existing WD-40 Specialist product lines to 22 additional countries in fiscal year 2013 and introduced WD-40 BIKE in the U.S., as well as WD-40 Specialist motorbike in the U.K. We've learned from these launches and are developing new programs and market expansion for both of these product lines in fiscal 2014.", "", "Our third strategic initiative is strategic business relationships. This encompasses acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alternatives for our brands and products. The company has been disciplined in evaluating acquisitions and has not yet found the right opportunity. We continue to evaluate strategic alternatives for our company's homecare and cleaning products during the fourth quarter, but no decision has been made, to date, relative to the future strategic plans for these brands.", "", "Our next strategic initiative is about -- around global innovation efforts. The \"Think Big\" reorganization completed during the third quarter resulted in us creating 3 innovation teams to better serve regional needs. During the fourth quarter, we moved the existing innovation closer to testing and launch, and new innovation teams identified new products to add to our pipeline. We look forward to additional uses and users and markets for these new products that will come to us in the coming periods.", "", "And the fifth strategic initiative is the development of our people, last, but not least, of course. Under our fifth strategic initiative, we continue to attract, develop and retain tribe members to execute our vision. We offered our tribe members 3 development opportunities in fiscal 2013.", "", "First, we continued our leadership LAP project, where tribe members develop talent and skills for both their professional growth in the company's performance. Secondly, we launched Tribology University, a program on technical product knowledge that enables our tribe to better converse about the attributes and features of our current and many new products. Third, we created -- we provided and created new career opportunities with the \"Think Big\" reorganization. Some of our employees were able to transition to positions focused on new product development, while others -- that were focused on homecare and cleaning products, were given opportunities to support customers and initiatives under our multi-purpose maintenance products.", "", "That completes the update on the strategic initiatives. So let's move onto the details of our fourth quarter and year-to-date results, starting with sales.", "", "Sales in the multi-purpose maintenance product category accounted for 87% of global sales in the fourth quarter, with the category sales up 16% in Q4 and up 12% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year periods. Products under this category includes WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE brands, as well as in material sales from BLUE WORKS brand and the WD-40 BIKE product line. By trading bloc, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products in Q4 were up 6% in the Americas, up 28% in EMEA and up 15% in Asia-Pacific, compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products were up 8% in the Americas, 8% -- 18% in EMEA and up 9% in Asia-Pacific compared to the prior fiscal year period.", "", "Homecare and cleaning products category accounted for 13% of global net sales in Q4. Sales down 16% in Q4 and down 15% for the year. Brands under this category include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh and No Vac, the 1001 brand, the X-14, Lava and Solvol. By trading blocs, sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the fourth quarter were down 19% in the Americas, down 10% in Europe and down 11% in Asia-Pacific. Year-to-date sales of homecare and cleaning products were down 20% in the Americas, down 7% in EMEA and relatively flat in Asia-Pacific compared to the prior fiscal year.", "", "Now onto the results, by segment, starting with the Americas. Sales in the Americas segment increased 1% in the fourth quarter and were up 2% year-to-date versus the prior year period. The segment accounted for 51% of global sales in Q4 as compared to 55% in the prior year period. Total sales -- total U.S. sales were flat in Q4 and up 1% year-to-date.", "", "Multi-purpose maintenance products increased 6% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to new and increased distribution of the WD-40 Specialist product line. Homecare and cleaning products sales decreased 22% in the fourth quarter, driven by Carpet Fresh, Spot Shot and our automatic toilet bowl cleaners, which declined 39%, 35% and 4%, respectively. Homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flow despite sales decline, with a portion of the decline stemming from our decision to reduce business in low-margin products and programs, which require significant trade discounting.", "", "Sales in the category also declined due to decreased promotional programs, competition and category declines, as well as volatility of orders within the warehouse club and mass retail channels. Sales in Latin America were up 8% in Q4 and up 9% year-to-date, driven by higher WD-40 sales throughout the region. Sales in Canada increased 5% in Q4 and by 1% year-to-date due to higher sales in the WD-40 and 2000 Flushes brands. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Q4 or year-to-date sales in Canada.", "", "Now let's move across the pond to EMEA, the segment which includes Europe, the Middle East & Africa. Sales in EMEA -- in the EMEA segment were up 25% in Q4 and up 16% year-to-date as compared to the prior fiscal period. Changes in foreign currency rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the fourth quarter year-to-date. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA segment would have increased 28% in Q4 and 18% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 38% of global sales in Q4 compared to 34% in the prior year period. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations in certain countries as well as through exclusive mid-marketing distributions and others.", "", "Sales in our EMEA direct market were up 40% in Q4 and are up 18% year-to-date. The sales growth in the fourth quarter is primarily due to new distribution, continuing growth of the brace business and positive impacts of sales price increases. In addition, that sales in the prior year period were relatively low, having been negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions, which existed in Europe during fiscal year 2012.", "", "The direct markets accounted for 68% of EMEA's total sales in Q4 compared to 61% in the prior fiscal year period. We sell through exclusive independent marketing distributors in eastern and northern Europe and the Middle East and Africa, with virtually all sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. Our distributor markets, in total, were up 2% in Q4 and were up 14% year-to-date. The distributor markets accounted for 32% of Europe's total sales in Q4 compared to 39% in the prior fiscal year period. We experienced double-digit sales growth in Eastern and Northern Europe due to higher multi-purpose sales as well as WD-40 distribution that began early in fiscal 2013. That growth was partially offset by lower sales in the Middle East, which was impacted by the political uncertainty in the region, as well as lower sales in Eastern Europe, which was impacted by counterfeit products in the marketplace.", "", "Now let's drop down to the Asia-Pacific segment. Sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were up 10% in Q4 and 7% year-to-date. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the fourth quarter and year-to-date. On a constant currency basis, sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were up 13% in Q4 and are up 8% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 11% of global sales in Q4 and 14% year-to-date. Sales in Australia decreased 15% in Q4 and were flat year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year period. The sales decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a lower level of promotional activity with key customers and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates period-to-period.", "", "Sales in China increased 77% in the fourth quarter and were up 9% year-to-date. The sales increase in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the timing of promotional activity. Promotional activity in the prior year fourth quarter was relatively low, whereas, promotional activity was relatively high in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. While sales in China grew 9% year-to-date, we believe our sales have been impacted by lower overall growth in the region. We continue to focus on the long-term opportunity in China, but there will continue to be a lot of volatility along the way, due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "", "Sales throughout the rest of Asia increased 7% in Q4 and 13% year-to-date. The increase in the fourth quarter was due to the continued growth of their multi-purpose maintenance products, primarily in Malaysia and Thailand. That's it for the strategy and sales update. I'll pass over to Jay who will continue to review the financials.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Thanks, Garry. In addition to the information that we're discussing here today on the call, we also remind you to review our 10-K, which will be filed next Tuesday, October 22.", "", "First, we always like to look at our 50/30/20 Rule, which is what we use to guide our business. And as you might recall, the 50 represents our gross margin, which we target to be at or above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses, without depreciation and amortization. Our target for that is 30% or less. And then finally, the 20 represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is at or above the 50%, while keeping our cost of business 30% or less, our EBITDA will be at or above that 20% target. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in the 10-K and in our investor presentations.", "", "Now let's take a quick look, first, at the 50 in our 50/30/20 rule. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 53% compared to the 49.4% in the prior year period. The increase of 360 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by price increases, the impact of changes in sales mix, as well as foreign currency exchange rates, along with lower input and manufacturing costs, which stem from our gross margin improvement opportunities.", "", "Let's first start with input costs. We experienced a net favorable impact of 50 basis points from changes in input costs. Changes in the cost of petroleum-based materials and aerosol cans combined favorably impacted our gross margin by 60 basis points in the period. This included lower aerosol can cost into China, stemming from our local sourcing initiative, as well as lower petroleum-based materials in our European segment.", "", "Changes in other input costs had a slight unfavorable impact of 10 basis points, and this include raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products, as well as valves and other components for our multi-purpose maintenance products.", "", "Sales price increases are considered and implemented periodically on a country-by-country, basis. We use price increases to offset the impact from our input cost increases. Period-versus-period, our gross margin showed an improvement of 110 basis points as a result of price increases implemented over the past 12 months. Advertising and promotional discounts were slightly higher in the quarter and had a negative impact on gross margin of 10 basis points. This is primarily the result of higher sales discounts in the Asia-Pacific trade block. The cost of promotional activities, such as sales incentives, trade promotions, coupon offers and cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction in sales, but the timing and the magnitude of these may cause fluctuations in gross margin period-to-period.", "", "A look at the impact of our major initiatives on cost of goods. We achieved lower manufacturing costs stemming from the North American supply chain restructure project, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points. In addition to the manufacturing cost, other areas within cost of goods, which have been impacted by the project, include transfer freight, along with warehousing and distribution cost. Excluding the impact of higher diesel and line haul rates, transfer freight for product between our third-party warehouses and manufacturing sites decrease period to period and possibly impacted our margin by 20 basis points. However, higher warehousing and distribution expense had a negative impact on our gross margin of 30 basis points. The higher costs were primarily driven by higher inventory levels. The cost and timing of transfer of freight, warehousing and distribution will vary with inventory levels, promotional activity, new product launches and other initiatives, as well as customer requirements.", "", "We've experienced a higher level of transition cost and a longer transition period than we'd additionally expected. But we now have the supply chain structure in place, and our efforts are focused on maximizing the efficiencies available from the new structure. As for the China project, we've benefited from the higher proportion of goods manufactured in China in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. This project for local manufacturing in China began halfway through fiscal 2012, and we have been increasing local production ever since. The lower cost period-versus-period had positive impact on gross margin of 10 basis points.", "", "Other impacts to gross margin include foreign currency exchange rates within our Europe segment, which positively impacted gross margin by 70 basis points. Cost of goods are sourced in pounds sterling, while revenues are generated in euros, pounds sterling and the U.S. dollar. The value of the euro increased period-to-period causing revenues from euro-based countries to be worth more in pounds sterling, thus improving the gross margin.", "", "Sales mix and all other miscellaneous items also had a positive impact on gross margin of 110 basis points in the fourth quarter. This includes the higher sales mix in our direct markets, which have a higher margin than our distributor markets. The themes discussed for the quarter for gross margin also apply, year-to-date. Our gross margin for the year was 51.3% compared to 49.2% in the prior fiscal year. The increase of the 210 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by a combination of price increases, lower promotional discounts and benefits from our supply chain-related initiatives.", "", "Well, that completes gross margin. Now onto the 30, or our cost of doing business. In the fourth quarter, the cost of doing business was 38% of net sales compared to 32% in Q4 in the prior fiscal year. Our goal was to have that cost of doing business at or below 30%. Period-versus-period, our sales increased by 10% in Q4, while our operating expenses increased by 35%, causing an increase in our cost of doing business percentage.", "", "For the year, the cost of doing business was 35% of net sales compared to 33% in the prior fiscal year. And approximately 78% of the cost of doing business comes from 3 main areas: 46% is related to people costs, the investments that we make in our tribe; 20% is related to our marketing and advertising and promotional investments; and 12% is in freight, the cost that we pay to get our products to our customers.", "", "Now for more details on our SG&A expenses. SG&A in Q4 was $29.4 million versus $21.6 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. As a percentage of net sales, it was 31.5% in the current quarter versus 25.5% in the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher employee costs, which increased $7.3 million period-versus-period, primarily due to higher bonus expense accruals. Most of our regions met or exceeded profit targets required to trigger payout of bonuses this fiscal year, compared to very few in the prior fiscal year. Employee costs were also impacted by higher compensation costs associated with annual merit increases and higher staffing levels. We also -- SG&A was also impacted by increased professional services and travel and meeting expenses, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. For the year, SG&A expense was $104.4 million versus $88.9 million in the prior fiscal year period, and as a percentage of net sales was 28.3% versus 25.9% in the prior year.", "", "Advertising and sales promotion expense in Q4 was $6.8 million compared to $6.2 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of sales, A&P investment was 7.3% in Q4 compared to 7.4% in the prior year. The higher level of investment period-versus-period was primarily due to the WD-40 Specialist line, which is now being sold in all 3 of our trading blocs. Year-to-date advertising sales promotion expense was $24.8 million compared to the $25.7 million last year. Advertising sales promotion expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 6.7% for the year from the 7.5% we achieved last year. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expense was primarily due to lower sales and investment in our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas.", "", "Amortization of intangible assets in the current quarter was $0.8 million compared to $0.5 million the prior fiscal period. Year-to-date, amortization remained relatively constant at $2.3 million compared to $2.1 million in the prior period.", "", "During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 million related to our 2000 Flushes brand, which was triggered by the forecasted decline in future revenue and profit for this brand. The lower forecast was attributed to lost distribution in the U.S. and our strategic decision to reduce business in certain channels and investment in certain programs.", "", "Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $38.2 million versus $28.3 million in Q4 of last fiscal year. Operating income in Q4 was $11.4 million compared to $13.6 million in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, total operating expenses were $132.6 million versus $116.8 million in the prior year. Operating income year-to-date was $56.6 million compared to the $51.7 million in the prior year. EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures, was 14% of net sales in Q4 compared to 17% in the prior year period. For the year, EBITDA was at 17% of net sales compared to 16% in the prior year. We target our EBITDA to be 20% of net sales, but do expect variations from time-to-time as sales, our advertising and promotional investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. Our EBITDA percentage is also affected by investments we make for future growth.", "", "The provision for income taxes in Q4 was 27.6% versus the 33.1% in the prior fiscal year quarter. The lower tax rate was primarily due to a higher level of foreign earnings generated in lower tax jurisdictions compared to the prior year period. And year-to-date, the provision for income taxes was 30% versus 30.3% in the prior year.", "", "Net income in Q4 was $8.1 million versus $9 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.2 million unfavorable impact in net income. Diluted earnings per share were $0.53 in Q4 compared to the $0.56 in the prior year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 59 -- 15.9 million shares to 15.4 million shares. Year-to-date, net income was $39.8 million versus the $35.5 million in the prior year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.2 million unfavorable impact on net income. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.54 for the year compared to $2.20 in the prior fiscal year. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 16 million shares to 15.6 million shares for the year.", "", "Regarding the dividend. On October 4, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share, payable on October 31, 2013, to shareholders of record on October 21, 2013. Based on today's closing price of $66.50, the annualized dividend yield would be 1.9%.", "", "A look at our financial position at the end of the year. We have a solid financial foundation that's supported by strong cash and short-term investment balances, as well as low debt and access to additional liquidity. This enables us to pursue both internal and external growth initiatives. As of August 31, our cash and cash equivalents were $53.4 million, an adequate level to support working capital needs and growth investments, as well as enough to help weather fluctuations in the capital markets and global economy. We also had $37.5 million in short-term investments, which consist of term deposits and callable time deposits held in money center banks. As for debt, our balance under our $125 million line of credit was $63 million at the end of the year.", "", "Capital allocation at WD-40 is a thoughtful and deliberate process. We focus both on return of capital to shareholders and investing for the future. Our first priority is our regular dividend. We target our dividend payout ratio of 50% of net income and has increased dividends in each of the last 3 years. We next look at opportunities to invest for future growth. This can be either internal growth or just market expansion and the new product introductions or by acquisition. Return on invested capital is the guiding principle for us, and we evaluate opportunities based on the highest expected returns. We are pleased that our return on invested capital has been above our target of 20% in each of the last 3 fiscal years, particularly given the investments we make in new products and markets to help support our long-term growth. As Garry mentioned, we continue to look for acquisitions and have not yet found the right opportunity. As a result, we return capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we acquired an additional 161,000 shares of our stock at a full cost of $9.1 million, bringing the total purchases in fiscal 2013 to $31.4 million. These purchases completed the $50 million share repurchase plan approved by the Board of Directors in December 2011, and also included initial purchases of $2.7 million, under the new $60 million repurchase plan approved by the board in June 2013.", "", "Well, that completes the financial review. More information, again, will be available on our Form 10-K, which will be filed Tuesday, October 22. Thanks so much, and now back to Garry.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. While we are celebrating our fiscal year 2013 results, we are also very excited about the outlook and initiatives we have in place to grow sales and earnings in fiscal year 2014 and beyond. We continue to tackle new opportunities and grow our leadership position in our categories, with further product launches planned under our multi-purpose brands. We remain cautiously optimistic about several macro factors, which include the stability in the global economy, major input costs and foreign currency exchange rates.", "", "Our fiscal year 2014 guidance assumes that we will benefit from new products and continue to experience recovery and improvement in the global economy. As for import costs, we hope that initiatives in the pipeline will help offset rising costs and maintain our gross margin at or above 50%. The following fiscal year 2014 guidance does not include any acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that the foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels. For fiscal year 2014, we expect our net sales result to be in the range of $383 million and $398 million, or a growth of between 4% and 8% versus fiscal year 2013. We project our gross margin to be close to 51%.", "", "We expect our global advertising and promotion investment to be in the range of 6.5% and 7.5%. We expect income of between $40.5 million and $42.8 million, which would achieve a diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.80, assuming a 15.3 weighted average shares outstanding.", "", "So to sum up, what did you hear from us in this call today? You heard, we celebrated our 60th year in the business by growing sales by 8% in fiscal year 2013. You heard that our sales growth was fueled by both our multi-use products and new and increased distribution of WD-40 Specialist product line. You heard that we achieved the gross margin of 51%, in part, due to cost savings from our North American supply chain Architecture project and our local sourcing initiatives in China. You heard that we continue to return capital to our shareholders through share buybacks. In fiscal year 2013, we purchased over 596,000 shares at a total cost of $31.4 million. You heard that WD-40 Company has been a good investment, yielding a return on invested capital of over 20% for the last 3 years. You've heard -- you heard that our 3 new innovation teams are actively developing new products and categories to fuel growth over the coming years. You heard that we expect sales growth of 4% to 8% in fiscal 2014 and that we are very excited about our future.", "", "I want to thank each and every tribe member for their contribution that made our 60th year in business such an amazing one. I'm proud to work with such a committed and engaged tribe, all working together to grow and sustain the WD-40 Company.", "", "I also thank our shareholders for their confidence and support this past year. We hope that you're as pleased as we are with this year's performance and we look forward to a productive and successful 2014.", "", "And as I do, in closing, I would like to share a quote with you, this time from Abraham Lincoln: \"Give me 6 hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first 4 sharpening the ax.\"", "", "Thank you for joining us today. We'd be pleased to now open the conference for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Daniel Rizzo with Sidoti & Company.", "Daniel D. Rizzo - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "I know one of the bigger long-term initiatives is the WD-40 Lawn and Garden, is that still on track? Do I remember correctly that's fiscal 2015, when that's going to launch?", "Garry O. Ridge", "WD-40 Lawn and Garden is one of the initiatives that we're working on around our WD-40 Specialist category expansion. We're still in a development stage of that, uncertain, yet, of the actual development of launch of it. But again, it's one of the many categories that we're working on.", "Daniel D. Rizzo - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "And then you indicated that high, I think, import costs are one of the things that are kind of a headwind. Could you just elaborate on what you're referring to there?", "Garry O. Ridge", "That might have been input costs.", "Daniel D. Rizzo - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "I'm sorry, input, yes. Sorry, I meant input.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Yes. I'm not sure that we see that, yet, as a headwind. I think that our view is that there -- as long as they're somewhat stable, that we're very comfortable.", "Garry O. Ridge", "And if I said that was -- it was an offset, then maybe I read my script wrong. But we don't see input costs as being a major headwind.", "Daniel D. Rizzo - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "Okay. And then, WD-40 BIKE, is that -- I mean, that's going according to plan and meeting company projections?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "As we said, BIKE is a pilot program. We're still working on it in the U.S. We're going to be expanding it into the other markets next year. But so far, we're comfortable with the amount of awareness and the activity that it's generating around the passionate users in the bike segment. It's certainly enhancing our overall brand positioning. So we'll continue to learn and it's one of the many, again, categories that we're working on at the moment.", "Daniel D. Rizzo - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "This would probably be just a little bit of a nicher project than some of your other product lines, I mean, focusing on more people who are passionate about bikes and not really the more recreational users, would that be accurate?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Correct.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next with Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Garry, during your prepared comments, talking about gross margins, you talked a lot about supply chain initiatives in China. You mentioned the local sourcing in for CATSA complete. Could you give us a sense as to where you are in terms of completing or how independent is the China operation in terms of local sourcing, manufacturing, et cetera?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "We are nearly complete. So we do have some products, some SKUs that do come from outside of China, but the vast majority are in China being manufactured for the China market.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "So -- okay. So most of what the benefit you've seen has already been done. You can fine tune it, you can bring some more products over, but you're seeing most of the benefit of these initiatives now.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "We're seeing the benefit of the China initiative for local manufacturing in China, and that for sourcing China products and sourcing as essentially complete with some of the additional spillover that will take place. We completed the activities around the North American supply chain product, which are the structural changes within the warehousing and distribution system, but we are still working on improving the efficiencies, et cetera and have the opportunity to increase our savings from those.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Great. And Garry, Specialist is now in 22 countries?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I think, that's correct.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Are you seeing a degree of consistency in the ramp, in terms of the customer take, or are some countries a little more challenging than, say, the U.S. or the U.K.?", "Garry O. Ridge", "It varies across countries. It also depends what SKUs or the products we're taking in there. But it's really very, very early days, Liam. We were pleased that in the fourth quarter we gained distribution for Specialist in the biggest home improvement retailer in the United States, and you'll find that in those stores now. So we've got -- this is a long, winding, but very exciting road.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Christina, actually, in for Joe tonight. I was wondering if you could talk about what the factors are that will input where you fall in guidance for next year. And then, I believe you said that you're increasingly more confident in the global outlook and just why you're more confident?", "Garry O. Ridge", "The first part of your question, around guidance, I missed what you asked, I'm sorry.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just the inputs that will affect where you fall within guidance?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I'm not sure I understand your question.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just what are going to be the biggest variables, in terms of where you fall within your guidance range for 2014?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Well, I think, gross margin is always important to us, so we want to be watching that closely. The other areas, we've got a range of sales that we feel reasonably comfortable about. Our track record has been, as we've been able to manage our advertising and promotional expenses over the years. So certainly, as has been in the past, gross margin is important to us, but then, that linked with reasonable sales growth. So I think those are the areas that we pay attention to all the time.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, great. And then, I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but your expectations for the tax rate next year?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "We didn't. It's near 31%, between 30.5% and 31% is what we're seeing.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have no more questions at this time.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks for joining us. We'll be back here in January. And again, we congratulate our tribe for delivering a stellar year. Good afternoon.", "Operator", "This concludes today's call.

These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company.

Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.74 compared to $0.69 for the same period last fiscal year.", "As we review our results for the first quarter, we'll be doing so under our 50-30-20 rule and our strategic initiatives. While global sales remained fairly flat due to the timing of promotional activities, we increased our gross margin to 52%, partly attributed to our strategic initiatives. We also prepared for many opportunities and challenges in fiscal year 2014.", "Before we dive into the financials, I'd like to take a moment to update you on our refreshed strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative #1 is to grow the WD-40 Multi-Use products. We had a moderate sales increase in WD-40 Multi-Use Product in the first quarter of Q1 compared to last fiscal year.", "This growth was lower than average due to the timing of promotional activities year-over-year. We had a strong promotional activity in the first quarter last year whereas we did not have that in the current quarter in most markets.", "We also had a lower level of replenishment orders after the exceptionally strong fourth quarter promotional efforts in fiscal 2013. We did nevertheless, experience double-digit growth in several markets within our European segment, which we now refer to as EMEA. EMEA includes Europe, Middle East, Africa and India. We also experienced double-digit growth in China and many distributor markets in the Asian region. Furthermore, we've sold into Albania for the first-time, bringing WD-40's brand's global reach to 188 countries.", "Strategic driver #2, which is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. The WD-40 Specialist product line continue to support the brand with double-digit growth in Q1 compared to the prior year, first quarter. We launched the product line into 8 new countries in Q1 including Australia and Turkey and smaller countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean. We also continued working on new formulations and delivery systems for the future WD-40 Specialist products.", "Strategic initiative #3 is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strength within our company to derive revenue from new sources outside our flagship WD-40 Multi-Use Products and Specialist product lines. Over the last few years, we have launched several new SKUs within our existing portfolio of brands including WD-40 BIKE, 3-IN-ONE and our household and cleaning products. Additional SKU launches are planned for fiscal year 2014 particularly in our 3-IN-ONE brand.", "Strategic driver #4 is to develop and retain and attract outstanding tribe members. Developing our tribe members is of utmost importance to us. We mentioned to you last fiscal year that we launched the Tribology University, a program on technical product knowledge that enables our tribe to better converse about the attributes and features of our foreign products. Our initial pilot in the U.S. went very well, and we are now taking the concept to the next level with e-learning side, courses, exams and with programs for our global tribe members. All tribe members from sales to accounting will have the opportunity to better learn about our products and position themselves for greater opportunity with our customers within the company.", "Strategic driver #4 is operational excellence. We put tremendous effort into the operational excellence of our company, so it was only natural to have this initiative add on its own. This includes continuous improvement by optimizing resources, systems and processes. This is important in managing our time, talent, treasure and our technology as we scale up our business.", "Operational excellence is also key to achieving an ever-increasing customer and regulatory requirements as we -- as well as helping to offset costs to protect our gross margin and profitability. We have several recent examples of operational improvements in excellence including our local sourcing initiative in China, third package of consolidation in the Americas, aerosol cans sourcing project in China and Europe, and a strong track record of shipping orders on time in full.", "We have several projects planned for 2014. First, we'll be focusing on achieving new regulatory requirements including a smooth transition to a lower VOC formulation in California. Second, we'll continue our canned sourcing project with focus on the Americas as well as improving operational efficiency within our supply chain network. Third, we are investing in systems to improve our back office operations including a major upgrade of our ERP system in EMEA and a new global human resource information system.", "That completes the update of our strategic initiatives. So let's move on to the details of our first quarter's results starting with sales. Sales grew $300,000 period-versus-period as growth from multi-purpose maintenance products more than offset declines in our homecare and cleaning products globally. We had a modest growth in Asia-Pacific, which impact -- was impacted by the timing of promotions and shipments year-over-year. This includes sales that shipped at the end of the fiscal 2003 that were planned for Q1 of fiscal 2004. The prior year first quarter was also one of the best on record due to the high replenishment orders in EMEA and a higher level of promotional activity as well as new distribution of WD-40 Specialist product line.", "Markets outside the U.S. accounted for 63% of global sales in Q1 versus 62% in the prior year period. Sales are -- in the multi-purpose maintenance products category accounted for 88% of global sales compared to 86% in the prior year period. Our multi-purpose maintenance product sales were up 3% in Q1 compared to the prior fiscal year quarter. By trading bloc, the category was up 1% in the Americas, up 4% in the EMEA and up 6% in Asia-Pacific. Global WD-40 brand sales grew by 3% in Q1 compared to the prior fiscal year quarter. This was driven by sales growth in both our WD-40 Multi-Use Product, the familiar blue and yellow can, and the WD-40 Specialist product line in EMEA and Asia-Pacific.", "Homecare and cleaning products sales continue to represent a smaller portion of our business per our strategic roadmap. The category accounted for 12% of global net sales in Q1 compared to 14% in the prior year period. These products include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, no vac, 1001, X-14 and the Lava and Solvol brands. Total homecare and cleaning product sales were down 15% globally in Q1 by trading bloc sales of homecare and cleaning products were down 16% in the Americas, down 14% [ph] in EMEA and down 8% in Asia Pacific.", "Decreased sales of homecare and cleaning products of the Americas was mostly attributed to Carpet Fresh, Spot Shot and 2000 Flushes, automatic toilet bowl cleaners, which were down 51%, 21% and 7% respectively. These brands were impacted by some loss distribution that occurred mid fiscal year 2003 particularly in the warehouse channel as well as decreased promotional programs and category declines. Homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flow despite the sales decline with a portion of the declines stemming from our decision to reduce business in low margin products and programs which require significant trade discounts.", "Lower homecare and cleaning product sales in EMEA are partly due to the timing of promotional activities year-over-year. Replenishment sales of the 1001 brand were particularly strong in the prior year period. Lower sales of homecare and cleaning products in Asia-Pacific are primarily due to the unfavorable impact from the change in foreign currency exchange rates. We continue to evaluate strategic alternatives for certain of the company's homecare and cleaning products during the first quarter but no decision has been made to date to change the strategic plans for these brands.", "Now, we'll talk a little bit more about our results by segment. Let's start with the Americas. Sales in the Americas decreased to $44 million in Q1, or 3%, versus Q1 of last fiscal year. The segment accounted for 46% of global sales in Q1 and 48% in the prior year period. Total sales in the U.S. were down 3% with the aforementioned declines in homecare and cleaning products more than offset modest growth in our multi-purpose maintenance product sales.", "Sales in Latin America, which are mostly the 3 -- the WD-40 brand remained flat period-versus-period. Sales in Canada decreased 6% in the first quarter primarily due to lower sales of Spot Shot and the WD-40 brand but as well as unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.", "Moving onto our EMEA segment. Sales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, increased to $36.5 million in Q1, up 3% versus Q1 of last fiscal year. This segment accounted for 38% of global sales compared to 37% in Q1 of last fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates period-versus-period did not have a material impact on sales. We sell into EMEA through a combination of both direct operations in certain countries as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in others.", "Sales in our EMEA direct markets were down 2% in Q1. The decrease period-versus-period is mostly attributed to the timing of promotional activities as the region had a strong promotional activities in the fourth quarter fiscal 2013. The prior year period also had a high level of replenishment orders.", "We sell through exclusive market -- independent marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe, India, Africa and in the Middle East with virtually all these sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. Our distributor markets were, in total, up 10% in Q1 due to promotional activity and the continued growth of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product. The distributor markets accounted for 44% of EMEA sales in Q1 compared to 41% in the prior fiscal year period.", "Now, we'll look a little bit more at Asia-Pacific. Sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region, increased to $15 million in Q1, or 4%, versus the Q1 of last fiscal year. The segment accounted for 16% of global sales in Q1 versus 15% in the prior fiscal year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been $15.4 million with an 8% growth over the prior year period.", "Sales in Australia remained constant at $4.6 million in Q1. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. And on a constant currency basis, sales would have increased $600,000 or 13%. The growth on a constant currency basis was due to the launch of the WD-40 Specialist product line and increased promotional activities.", "Sales in China are increased 24% in Q1 to $3.4 million, driven by both organic growth and the timing of promotional activities. We had a low level of promotional activity in the prior year quarter compared to a relatively strong promotional activity in the current quarter. We continue to focus on the long-term opportunities in China but there will continue to be a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and the varying industrial activities.", "Sales in the rest of Asia remained flat at $6.9 million for the first quarter. Lower sales in Indonesia offset the sales growth in other distributor markets. The lower sales in Indonesia were due to the transition that we have been going through to a new marketing distributor.", "That's it for me for now for the sales update. I'll now pass over to Jay who will continue to review the financials.", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Thanks, Garry. In addition to the information that we're presented on this call today, we suggest that you review our Form 10-Q, which we'll be filing tomorrow.", "First, let's review our 50-30-20 rule, that's the measures that we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 50 represents gross margin. We target our gross margin to be at or above 50% of sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target for that is 30% or less. And finally, the 20 represents EBITDA.", "If our gross margin is at or above 50% and our cost of business is 30% or less, our EBITDA will be at or above the 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and the descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Qs and in our investor presentations.", "First, let's take a look at the 50 or the gross margin. Gross margin in the first quarter was 52% compared to 50.1% in the prior fiscal year period. The increase of 190 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by price increases, lower promotional discounts as well as lower input costs and lower manufacturing costs stemming from our supply chain-related initiatives. Our margin was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.", "A quick look at the input costs. We experienced this favorable net impact of 30 basis points from our major input costs. Impacts from changes in the cost of petroleum-based materials and aerosol cans combined to favorably impacted our gross margin by 50 basis points. Much of this benefit came from the Asia-Pacific and EMEA segments.", "Changes in our other input costs including raw materials related to homecare and cleaning products had an unfavorable impact of 20 basis points. Sales price increases are considered and implemented periodically on a country-by-country basis to offset the impact from cost increases. And during this period, our gross margin improved 40 basis points as a result of price increases implemented during the prior fiscal year.", "Lower promotional discounts had a positive impact on our gross margin of 70 basis points. Lower percentage of sales during the current quarter was subject to promotional allowances compared to that in the prior quarter. This was partially a result of lower sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas as well as lower promotional discounts being given on these products. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentives, trade promotions, cash discounts that we give to customers are recorded as a reduction to sales. And the timing and magnitude of these can cause fluctuations at our gross margin period-to-period.", "Looking at the changes as a result of our manufacturing costs, we achieved lower manufacturing costs in China and in the Americas, and we've been increasing the portion of our goods manufactured in China for the local market since we began local production in the latter half of 2012. The higher proportion of goods manufactured in China positively impacted our margin by 10 basis points period-versus-period. In the Americas, we benefited from lower manufacturing costs stemming from the North American supply chain architecture project. The lower cost positively impact -- this lower cost positively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points.", "Other impacts to gross margin include foreign currency exchange rates within our EMEA segment, which positively impacted our gross margin by 50 basis points. Cost of goods are sourced in pound sterling while revenues are generated in euros, sterling and the U.S. dollar. The value of the euro increased period-versus-period causing revenues from euro-based countries to be worth more in pound sterling thus, improving the gross margin of that region. Sales mix and all other miscellaneous impacts combined unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points. That completes the gross margin discussion.", "Now, let's take a look at the 30 or our cost of doing business. Our cost of doing business was 33% in both Q1 of this year and the same period last year. In the first quarter, approximately 68% of the cost of doing business came from 3 areas: 38% related to our people, the investments we make in our tribe, 18% from investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion, and 12% in the cost of -- associated with the freight to get our products to our customers.", "A little bit more details of our SG&A expenses. The SG&A expense in Q1 increased by 5% to $26.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, it was 27.9% in Q1 compared to 26.6% in the prior year quarter. We had a higher employee cost of $1.4 million due to higher compensation costs associated with annual merit increases, higher staffing levels, in addition, we had our book -- in addition, both professional services and travel and meeting expenses were each up $0.2 million and were -- but were partially offset by lower freight expense, which was down $0.3 million versus the prior period. All other miscellaneous expenses combined increased by $0.3 million.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact decreasing SG&A expenses by $2 billion -- $0.2 million, excuse me. Advertising and sales promotion expense decreased by 7% in Q1 to $5.6 million. As a percentage of sales, A&P investment was 5.9% in Q1 compared to 6.4% in the prior year period. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion expense was primarily due to lower cost associated with promotional programs conducted in the Americas and the timing of promotional activities in EMEA region.", "Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively constant at $0.6 million in Q1 compared to $0.5 million in the prior year period. Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $32.9 million versus $31.9 million in Q1 of last fiscal year. Operating income in Q1 was $16.8 million compared to $15.9 million in the prior year quarter.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50-30-20 measures was 19% of net sales in Q1 compared to 18% in the prior fiscal year quarter. Period-versus-period, higher gross margins more than offset the higher operating expense enabling us to grow our EBITDA percentage. As you know, we target EBITDA to be 25 -- to be 20% of net sales but expect variations from time to time of the sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. Our EBIT percentage is also affected by investments we continue to be making for future growth.", "The provision for income taxes in Q1 was 30.3% versus 31% in the prior fiscal quarter. The lower tax rate in the current quarter is primarily driven by the increasing proportion of the company's earnings, which are foreign and are taxed at lower rates. Along with tax provision adjustments associated with the filing of the company's tax returns.", "Net income in Q1 was $11.5 million versus $10.9 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net income. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.74 in Q1 compared to $0.69 in the prior fiscal year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.8 million shares to 15.4 million shares.", "A look at our balance sheet, at November 30, it remains -- continues to remain strong as our cash and term deposits exceed our debt. At November 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $51.4 million, and we had $40.7 million in short-term investments, which consists of term deposits and callable time deposits held in money center banks. The outstanding balance of our debt under the current existing line of credit remained unchanged at $63 million.", "In addition to investing for future growth, we also focus on returning capital to our shareholders. First, we provide our shareholders with a regular dividend, which we target at 50% of net income. On December 10, the Board of Directors declared a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend increasing the dividend from $0.31 per share to $0.34 per share. The dividend will be payable on January 31, 2014 to shareholders of record on January 6, 2014. And based on today's closing price of $75.55, the annualized dividend yield would be 1.8%. This is the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases.", "We also have been returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. During the first quarter, we acquired approximately 78,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $5.2 million. These shares were acquired under the latest share repurchase plan approved by the Board of Directors in June of last year. It authorizes us to acquire up to $60 million of the company's outstanding shares through the planned end date of August 2015. We expect to continue executing on our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of this fiscal year.", "That includes the -- concludes the financial overview. More information, again, will be available in our Form 10-Q, which we'll file tomorrow. And now, back to Garry.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. If we sum up, there are several macroeconomic factors that impact our outlook. As well as our progress towards our strategic initiatives. We are cautiously optimistic about several macroeconomic factors, which include the stability of the global economy, major input costs and foreign currency exchange rates.", "In terms of sales, we feel the growth of our multi -- WD-40 Multi-Use Product and the WD-40 Specialist product line will overcome the uncertainty that continues to linger across the globe. We also expect our multi-purpose products to offset decreases in our homecare and cleaning products.", "As for input costs, we hope that our initiatives will help us maintain our margin and offset the volatility and uptrend we're seeing in petroleum-based materials.", "Now on to our guidance, which remains unchanged from what we shared with you in our October call and the annual shareholder meeting in December. The following fiscal year 2014 guidance does not include any acquisition or divestiture activities, and it does assume that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels.", "For the year, we expect our fiscal year net sales to be in the range of $383 million to $398 million and that would be a growth of between 4% and 8% versus fiscal 2013. We project our gross margin will be close to 51%. We expect our global advertising and promotional investments to be in the range of 6.5% and 7.5% of net sales and we expect our net income to range somewhere between $40.5 million and $42.8 million, which would achieve a diluted earnings per share of between $2.65 and $2.85 assuming 13 -- sorry, 15.3 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "In summary, what did you hear from us in this call today? You heard that the growth in our multi-purpose products more than offset decreases in homecare and cleaning products. You heard that we grew gross margin to 52% partly due to lower import costs and lower manufacturing costs stemming from our supply chain initiatives. You heard that we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives including preparing for a lower VOC formula conversion in California as well as developing new SKUs for launch later in fiscal year 2014 and 2015. You heard we grew diluted earnings per share from $0.69 to $0.74 per share and have increased our regular quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.34 per share. And you heard that our outlook is cautiously optimistic, and that we are maintaining our guidance with sales growth of between 4% and 8% for fiscal 2014.", "In closing, I'd like to share a quote with you from Nelson Mandela. \"It's better to lead from behind and to put others in front especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.\"", "Thank you for joining us today. We'd be very happy to open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Garry, could we get an update on the Specialist brand rollout? It's the earliest -- I mean, the most -- the longest time it's been on the shelves is in the North American markets and then you sort of rolled out to Asia-Pacific. But can we get an update on how that's going?", "Garry O. Ridge", "I think we're currently in 27 countries. We took it out to some new ones in Australia or I think in Turkey in the first quarter. We continue to be cautiously and optimistic but pleased with the progress. We continue to see ongoing replenishment sales in the North American market particularly in the hardware, home improvement and automotive category. We're happy with the work that's happened in the U.K. with the motorcycle and we're now rolling that into a couple of new countries. So we continue to see that Specialist will offer us good opportunity to execute and to deliver growth on the back of the power of the shield in the core brands. So, it's still -- even though it's been a while, it's still very early days for us. There's a lot of work to do but we feel good about it.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Thank you, Garry. You mentioned an ERP upgrade in the European or EMEA now?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Yes.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Do you anticipate any kind of disruption based on the guidance that you've given?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No, we're -- we are -- we're really at the near end of the upgrade. It's just a matter -- it's been running parallel for a while. There's some more work to be done. We don't see any disruption at all at this time. It's been progressively tested through a number of the markets. Our first go live launch is May 2014.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then Jay, you had some heavy working capital needs, is there anything unusual there? Or can we expect a fairly normal cash flow, a cash flow similar to what we've seen in the past years?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Yes. We expect $40-plus million on an annual basis of kind of free cash flow.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Youyou Yan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "This is Youyou Yan for Jeff. Could you please specify on the raw material guidance regarding which raw materials or manufacturing costs do you expect to really go up given that the annual guidance of gross margin is 51% versus 52% for this quarter?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Well, we don't see -- we see the current range of raw materials is what's embedded in our current outlook on margin. So we have other impacts associated with mix that may have -- that have -- that are built into some of that 51%.", "Garry O. Ridge", "But as we say, we say we expect it to be close to 51%. We're not good enough to be 100% laser accurate but we're certainly happy at the moment that it's above 51%.", "Youyou Yan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Do you see the recent trend of -- on higher HDP price on a year-over-year basis have any negative impact on your gross margin for the next quarter?", "Garry O. Ridge", "You mean plastics?", "Youyou Yan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Plastics is -- has a -- it's a very -- the 2 biggest components in our raw material costs are petroleum and steel cans, which I think together make up, Jay, about...", "Jay W. Rembolt", "About 50...", "Garry O. Ridge", "60%. We don't have a lot of plastic in our overall costs basis.", "Youyou Yan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And also from a longer-term perspective, where do you expect your SG&A expense would be in terms of the total sales from a longer-term perspective in order to get the 30% target?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Yes. I mean, we see the 30% being achieved over time as we grow revenue. We don't see a reduction on our current SG&A expenses. We see them continuing to grow but not growing at the rate of sales. And as sales will increase, we'll be able to see that -- we'll be able to get closer to the 30%.", "Youyou Yan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So over time, is there a target, say, 5 years or 10 years or you don't know yet?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Well, in our minds we have a target. The 5-year range is really probably the -- I think that's a reasonable range for that target.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Can you -- I mean, clearly this was your hardest sales growth comparison of the year, and you explained that it was the timing of promotional activity. And in the second quarter, it looks like you have a much easier comparison. So is it reasonable to assume that we'll see a little bit higher sales growth in the second quarter? And is there any way to quantify the effect that timing had on the sales growth in the quarter?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Linda, we don't comment quarter-to-quarter. What we do believe is that our range for the year between 4% and 8% is still a worthy range. But there are -- both promotional and geographic mix that affect quarter-to-quarter, you're right. We just had the biggest quarter in the company's history compared to the second biggest quarter in the company's history, which was the first quarter of last year. So although there would be a desire for us to get more granular, we really are in a position where we'd like to stay within the annual target, and we'll -- we see that we'll be talking about that again at the end of the next quarter. So that's kind of where we feel we are right now.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I think that you've talked in the past about entering into contracts or modifying your contracts for the tin cans in January. Is that something to come further -- later in the month? Is there anything you can talk in terms of -- do you expect those costs to be down year-over-year? Or is there any color you can give on that process?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "Yes. At the moment, we're not expecting them to be down but we aren't expecting a very significant increase -- we are not expecting a dramatic increase either. We're still in negotiations and we'll be able to comment once those are completed kind of near the end of the month.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Great. And then in terms of your expansion in Specialist and these other lines, the Motorbike and BIKE line, is there any way to quantify how much of your SG&A increase is due to the investments behind that? I know you had a subsidiary for the BIKE line, they had 2 employees, are you going to be adding? Are you adding more people? Is this what the SG&A increase is? Or is it more just regular operating day-to-day investments?", "Garry O. Ridge", "It's regular operating day-to-day investments. We are really leveraging primarily the infrastructure that we have in place. But you're seeing increases for things like our continued deployment of people in China, which we would be doing whether we had Specialist or not. But there is really very, very little incremental extra overhead associated with the Specialist growth.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the just general economic outlook, are you seeing changes? Like how does Europe feel to you? Because we had seen some signs of improvement and I guess, some of your European business was quite good this quarter. But do you sense any change, any reversal and softening or sort of a little bit of improvement there?", "Garry O. Ridge", "No. We think it's at steady where it was. I was interested this morning on CNBC. They were talking about retail sales were up in Europe over the Christmas period. I think -- my view on Europe is, there's less fear there now than there was 1 year ago. And fear is a paralyzing aspect, so from our point we feel steady as she goes. We feel reasonable about the European market as we do everywhere right now. I think we're in a state of -- particularly in the segments that we operate in, that -- where primarily housing and automotive seem to be doing okay. So that's why we said we're cautiously optimistic about the macroeconomic conditions there, seem to be around us at the moment.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And, I guess, finally, just on the lawn and garden line that you've alluded to in the past, is there anything else you can tell us? I mean, I would think you would have to launch that, if you were going to, before the spring. Would that have to be by February or March? Or do you have anything you can tell?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Well, lawn and garden was an example of one of the things that we're working on. And we shared it as saying this is an area that we may go into. There are a number of those projects in fact on the table, and we have to get the business model right for them. But we have a lot of work to do with Specialist still in other areas before we bring new categories in. But what we're really sharing is that we see that there are a lot of categories that Specialist has a potential to go in. We've been doing work around the opportunity in lawn and garden. We're looking at others as I said so. As we get closer and when we're ready to go, we'll either let you know that we are testing or piloting or we're going to go full stream.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And then can I just fit in one more? You had mentioned some additional formulations or SKUs or something in 3-IN-ONE product. Can you distinguish for us how that's posited in the market versus WD-40 as a product? And then if you can give us some idea of what these additional things might be?", "Garry O. Ridge", "Yes, sure. Some of them are out there now. 3-IN-ONE is basically precise delivery one drip at a time. And we've already launched a couple of extensions of the 3-IN-ONE system with the -- what we call our Marksman delivery system, which is an extendable tube on our 3-IN-ONE brand. But it's basically taking solutions to the end-user under the 3-IN-ONE brand in the lubricant and protection category with a different delivery system than WD-40.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And then -- so that would mean, it wouldn't be really cannibalizing of WD-40? It would be something new and incremental to the whole...", "Garry O. Ridge", "No. When the end-user has a different need than the delivery system does. But they maybe a little cross but it will not cannibalize WD-40 in any way at all.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one last one. On your non-strategic homecare and cleaning businesses, what specifically are you like doing? I mean, are you -- what would make you decide to auction off the business -- hold an auction and actually sell the businesses? And is the profit margin actually going up because you're cutting unprofitable SKUs and A&P spending, so the margins are actually going up?", "Jay W. Rembolt", "I'll answer that second one first. Yes, that's exactly what's happening. We have reduced a number of SKUs and a number of kind of promotional activities that were just not generating the level of profitability that we'd like. As reflected in that, we've seen the pullback in sales. As far as our decision to auction it, we are comfortable with holding it. We see the cash flow from it as being -- well, as it's embedded in some of our expectation. So it really would take somebody coming along saying, \"Hey, these are a fit for us.\" And we want to be able to take these and leverage them in some way that's beyond what we see for them. We see our ability to continue to operate and execute in a harvest mode. If somebody wanted to pay us a premium to either change them, we'd be more than interested in entertaining the offer.", "Garry O. Ridge", "And remember, too, we're really primarily speaking about them in the United States. The 1001 business in the U.K. and our business down in Australia are a little bit different. So if we were to exit any of them, it would only be in the U.S. at this time.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Ridge, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Garry O. Ridge", "Thank you for joining us today. Well, just a reminder that our next earnings conference call is scheduled for Tuesday, April 8, 2014, at 2 p.m. San Diego time. And until we meet -- we talk to you again, we hope you stop some squeaks. Have a good afternoon.", "Operator", "And again, this does conclude today's WD-40 Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. We thank you again for your participation."]}

Before we start, I would like to remind you that except for historical information this conference call may contain forward-looking statements concerning WD-40's outlook for sales, earnings, dividends and other financial results. These statements are based on an assessment of a variety of factors, contingencies and uncertainties considered relevant by WD-40 Company.", "Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including the impact of commodity prices, the introduction of new product lines and the fluctuating global conditions, including currency exchange rates, both in the United States and internationally.

A reminder that our Q3 earnings conference call will be on July 9", "Thanks for joining us for the call today. Today we reported net sales of $94.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, an increase of 9% over Q2 last year. Year-to-date net sales were $189.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year period. Net income for the second quarter was $10.3 million compared to $10.5 million in Q2 last fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.67 compared to $0.66 for the same period last fiscal year. Year-to-date net income was $21.8 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $1.41, up 4% from $1.35 in the prior fiscal year.", "Before we focus on the sales results, let's review the progress we have made towards our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 multi-use product. Sales of WD-40 multi-use product increased by 10% in the second quarter compared to Q2 last fiscal year. We grew multi-use product sales 16% in the Americas and 18% in EMEA segment. Multi-use product sales decreased 25% in Asia-Pacific, primarily due to China and our Asian distributors. China was lower due to a general slowdown in economic growth, as well as a decrease in our sales associated with promotional programs. Sales in Asia were impacted by backlog of orders that we were unable to ship in Q2 of this fiscal year as we planned. We expect to ship these queued orders in Q3 of this fiscal year. Sales also continued to be impacted by the transition of our marketing distributor in Indonesia which is one of the larger markets in our Asia Pacific distributor region.", "Our strategic driver number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. The WD-40 Specialist product line continued to support the brand with sales doubling over the prior year second quarter. We experienced strong growth across all three segments compared to both Q1 last fiscal year as well as Q1 of this fiscal year. We released new product offerings in certain markets throughout the second quarter, while expanding distribution of existing products into new territories. We continue to develop new formulations and delivery systems for the future WD-40 Specialist products.", "Our strategic initiative three is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within our company to derive revenue from new sources outside our flagship WD-40 Multi-use product and the WD-40 Specialist product line. We launched five new SKUs under our 3-IN-ONE brand at the end of the second quarter in certain markets and also expanded distribution of WD-40 bike products in test markets in Australia earlier in the fiscal year.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. We welcomed 8 new tribe members during the second quarter and have welcomed 22 new members year-to-date. Developing our tribe members is of utmost importance to us. We commenced our third year of the leadership lab in January to help the next generation develop talents and skills for both their professional growth and the company's performance. We also continued with the Tribology University, a program of technical product knowledge that enables our tribe to better converse about the attributes and features of our products. Those development programs are now offered globally allowing all our tribe members from sales to accounting from Shanghai to San Diego to better position themselves for greater opportunity with our customers and within the company.", "Strategic driver or initiative number five is operational excellence. This includes the continuous improvement by optimizing resources, systems and processes. Operational excellence is also key to meeting our ever-increasing customer and regulatory requirements, as well as helping to offset rising cost that help us protect our gross margin. During the second quarter, we continued to benefit from our aerosol can sourcing project in China and Europe, which both greatly contributed to our gross margin improvement. We also managed a smooth transition to a lower VOC formula in California to meet the new regulatory requirements. We also continued our investment and testing of new systems to improve our back-office operations, most particularly a major upgrade of our ERP system in EMEA and a new global human resource information system. Both systems are on track to go live at the end of the fiscal year.", "Last but not least, we began to implement a new project management system that will help improve visibility, resource management and tracking of our innovation and renovation project.", "That completes an update of our strategic initiatives. So let's move on to the details of the second quarter and year-to-date results starting with sales. Sales in multipurpose maintenance products category accounted for 89% of the global sales in the second quarter with category sales up 11% in Q2 and up 7% year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal year periods. Products under this category include the WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE brands, as well as some immaterial sales of the WD-40 bike product line.", "By trading block, sales of multipurpose maintenance products in Q2 were up 18% in the Americas, up 17% in EMEA and down 23% in Asia-Pacific, compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date sales of multipurpose maintenance products were up 9% in the Americas, up 10% in EMEA and down 8% in Asia-Pacific, compared to the prior fiscal year period. Homecare and cleaning products category accounted for 11% of global net sales in Q2 with the category down 8% in Q2 and down 11% year-to-date. Brands under this category include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, No Vac, 1001, X-14 and the Lava and Solvol brands.", "By trading block, sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the second quarter were down 12% in the Americas, up 8% in EMEA and down 7% in Asia-Pacific. Year-to-date sales of homecare and cleaning products were down 14% in the Americas, down 4% in EMEA and down 7% in Asia-Pacific, compared to prior year fiscal periods.", "Now, let's take a look at the results by segment starting with the Americas. Sales in the Americas segment increased 12% in the second quarter and were up 4% year-to-date versus the prior year period. The segment accounted for 48% of our global sales in Q2 as compared to 46% in the prior year period. Total U.S. sales were up 16% in Q2 and up 6% year-to-date. Multipurpose maintenance products sales increased 23% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher promotional activity and new distribution of the WD-40 Specialist product line, compared to the prior year period.", "Homecare and cleaning product sales decreased 10% in the second quarter driven by Carpet Fresh and Spot Shot which declined 33% and 21% respectively. Homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flow despite the sales decline with a portion of the declines stemming from our decision to reduce sales of low margin products and programs which require significant trade discounts. Sales in this category also declined due to decreased promotional programs, competitors and category declines, as well as volatility of orders within the warehouse, clubs and mass retail channels.", "Sales in Latin America were up 20% in Q2 and are up 9% year-to-date driven by higher WD-40 sales throughout the region. Sales in Canada decreased 22% in Q2 and 15% year-to-date due to the timing and decreased promotional level of activities and programs, as well as an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At constant currency, sales in Canada would have declined by 15% in the second quarter.", "Now on the EMEA segment which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Sales in the EMEA segment were up 16% in Q2 and are up 9% year-to-date as compared to prior year periods. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on sales in the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA segment would have increased 13% in Q2. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on year-to-date sales. The segment accounted for 40% of global sales in Q2 compared to 38% in the prior fiscal year.", "We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations in certain countries as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in other countries. Sales in our EMEA direct markets were up 9% in Q2 and are up 3% year-to-date. The sales growth in the second quarter was primarily due to promotional activities and the increase sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line stemming from new distribution and additional product offerings. Sales growth year-to-date was primarily due to new distribution, continued growth of the base business and positive impacts of sales price increases. The direct markets accounted for 64% of EMEA's total sales in Q2 compared to 69% in the prior fiscal year period.", "We sell through exclusive marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe and in the Middle East, India and Africa, with most of sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. The distributor markets in total were up 33% in Q2 and up 19% year-to-date. The distributor markets accounted for 36% of EMEA's total sales in Q2 compared to 31% in the prior fiscal year period. We experienced double digit sales across the distributor markets in Q2 and year-to-date due to the continued growth of the base business in key markets, a successful promotional program in Russia and the increased sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line in Eastern Europe.", "Now the Asia-Pacific segment. Sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were down 21% in Q2 and are down 8% year-to-date. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the second quarter and year-to-date. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia-Pacific segment were down 16% in Q2 and down 4% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 12% of global sales in the second quarter and 14% year-to-date.", "Sales in Australia decreased 3% in Q2 and were down 1% year-to-date compared to prior year fiscal periods. Although reported sales decreased period-to-period, sales increased on a constant currency basis due to the base business and the launch of the WD-40 Specialist product line in Q2.", "Sales in China decreased 28% in the second quarter and were down just 2% year-to-date. The sales decrease in the second quarter was attributed to differences in promotional activity, programs with more significant and our customers purchased more products in the second quarter fiscal 2013 as compared to programs in the current fiscal year. We also believe sales have been impacted by lower overall growth in the region. Be remember we continue to focus on the long-term opportunities in China, but there will continue to be a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, the shifting economic patterns and the varying industrial activities.", "Sales throughout the rest of Asia decreased 30% in Q2 and 15% year-to-date. The lower sales in the quarter were driven by a backlog of orders that we were unable to ship in Q2 of this fiscal year. We expect to ship these orders in Q3 of this fiscal year. Sales were also impacted in Indonesia from the continuing transition to a new marketing distributor.", "That's it for the sales update. Now I will pass it over to Jay who will continue with the review of the financials. Thanks, Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Garry, thank you so much. Just a reminder, in addition to the information that we will provide on this call today, we suggest that you review our Form 10-Q which we will file tomorrow.", "Now let's first review our 50/30/20 rule, the measures that we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be at or above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is 30% or less. And then finally, the 20 represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is at or above 50% and our cost of business is 30% or less, our EBITDA will be at or above the 20% target. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q and in our investor presentations.", "Now a look at gross margin or the 50. Gross margin in the second quarter was 51.6% compared to 50.9% in the prior fiscal year period. The increase of 70 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by lower input costs as well as the impact of price increases implemented during the last 12 months, all of which were partially offset by higher promotional discounts.", "A look at input costs. We experienced a net unfavorable impact of 70 basis points from our major input costs. This was driven by changes in the cost of petroleum-based materials along with lower can costs and in Asia-Pacific and EMEA segments. The net impact of changes in other input cost was not material. Sales price increases are considered and implemented on a country-by-country basis periodically to help offset the impact from input cost increases. Period versus period, our gross margin improved by 30 basis points as a result of price increases. This was offset by higher promotional discounts, which had an unfavorable impact on our gross margin of 30 basis points.", "A higher percentage of sales during the current quarter was subject to promotional allowances compared to that in the prior year. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentives, trade promotions, cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction in sales. The timing and magnitude of these activities cause fluctuations in gross margin period to period. All other impacts to gross margin, combined, were neutral for the quarter, and these include changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our EMEA segment, sales mix, manufacturing cost savings and all other miscellaneous impacts.", "The themes discussed for the quarter for gross margin also apply to the year-to-date results. Gross margin year-to-date was 51.8% compared to the 50.5% in the prior fiscal year. The increase of 130 basis points in gross margin was primarily driven by the combination of price increases, lower promotional discounts, lower input costs, manufacturing cost savings and a net favorable impact to year-to-date from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in our EMEA segment. That completes our gross margin.", "Now let's take a look at the 30 or our cost of doing business. In both the second quarter and our year-to-date period, the cost of doing business was 34% compared to 33% in the prior fiscal year periods. While our goal is to have the cost of doing business at or below 30% of net sales, the percentage may fluctuate due to the changes in sales and timing of expenses, as well as investments that we make for the future. Year-to-date 69% of our cost of doing business came from three areas, 39% is related to people costs or our investment in our tribe, 18% from our investments in marketing and advertising and promotional activities, and finally 12% in freight costs which was getting our product to our customers.", "Now more details on our SG&A expenses. In Q2, they increased by 11% to $26.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 28.3% in Q2 compared to 27.6% in the prior year quarter. Employee related costs increased by $1.2 million due to higher staffing levels as well as higher compensation costs associated with annual merit increases and higher bonus expense. Professional services along with travel and meeting expense were each up $0.2 million. Freight expense was up $0.4 million versus the prior period due to higher sales volume and all other miscellaneous expenses combined increased by $0.6 million and these include research and development costs, depreciation expenses, regulatory compliance costs and others. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact period to period increase in SG&A expenses by $0.1 million.", "The themes discussed for the quarter also again apply to year-to-date results. SG&A expense year-to-date was $53.4 million versus $49.3 million in the prior fiscal year period. As a percentage of net sales it was 28.1% this fiscal year versus 27.1% in the prior fiscal year. Advertising and sales promotion expense increased by 14% in Q2 to $6 million. As a percentage of sales, A&P investment was 6.4% in Q2 compared to the 6.1% in the prior year period. The increase in advertising and sales promotion expense was primarily associated with promotional programs conducted in the Americas this period.", "Year-to-date advertising and sales promotion expense was $11.6 million compared to $11.3 million in the prior fiscal year period. Advertising and sales promotion expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 6.1% year-to-date from the 6.2% in the prior year. The slight increase in advertising and sales promotion expense year-to-date was primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in the Americas programs during Q2.", "Our amortization of intangible assets increased $0.7 million in Q2 compared to $0.5 million in the prior year period and year-to-date amortization was $1.2 million compared to $0.9 million in the prior period. The increase in the year-to-date amortization was primarily due to the change in the useful life the 2000 Flushes trade name in Q3 of the last fiscal year.", "Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $33.3 million compared to $29.7 million in Q2 of last year. Operating income in Q2 was $15.3 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior quarter and year-to-date total operating expenses were $66.2 million versus $61.6 million in the prior year period. Operating income year-to-date was $32 million compared to $30.3 million in the prior fiscal year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures, was 18% of net sales in Q2 compared to 19% in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, EBITDA was 18% to net sales in both the current and prior year periods. Again, we target EBITDA to be at 20% but expect variations from time to time as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities, as well as our investments that we make for the future.", "Interest income and interest expense remained constant in the second quarter with net interest expense increasing by $0.1 million year-to-date. Other net expense increased by point $0.8 in the second quarter and $1 million year-to-date. The change period to period was mainly due to fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the U.S./Pound or the Great British Pound against the U.S. dollar. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses in the current fiscal year, compared to foreign currency exchanges in the prior fiscal year.", "The provision for income tax in Q2 was 31% versus 30.2% in the prior year quarter. The higher tax rate in the current year was primarily driven by changes in the portion of the company's earnings which are foreign and are taxed at lower rates. Year-to-date the provision for income taxes is 30.6% in both the current and prior fiscal year periods.", "Net income in Q2 was $11.3 million versus $10.5 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates period to period did not have a material impact on the translation of our results during the second quarter.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $0.67 in Q2 compared to $0.66 in the prior fiscal quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.7 million shares to 15.3 million shares. Year-to-date net income was $21.8 million versus $21.4 million in the prior year.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on the translation of our results by $0.2 million. Our year-to-date results translated at last year's exchange rates or what we term as constant currency basis would have produced net income of $22 million versus the actual $21.8 million.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $1.41 year-to-date compared to $1.35 in the prior fiscal year period. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.7 million shares to 15.3 million shares.", "A look at our balance sheet. On February 28, our balance sheet continues to remain strong as cash and term deposits continue exceeding our debt. At February 28, our cash and cash equivalents were $41 million and we had $45 million in short-term investments, consisting of term deposits and callable time deposits held in money centered banks. The current portion of our debt under our existing line of credit was $73 million. It represented a $10 million increase in the line during the second quarter and was primarily used for the repurchase of our shares.", "We continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Regarding the dividend, on March 25, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 a share payable on April 30 to shareholders of record on April 11, 2014. Based on today's closing price of $77.82, the annualized dividend yield would be 1.75%.", "As for share repurchases, we acquired nearly 240,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $17 million during the second quarter. These shares were acquired under our latest share repurchase plan approved by the Board of Directors in June 2013. It provides authorization to acquire up to $60 million of the company's outstanding shares through the plan's end date of August 2015. We expect to continue executing our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year.", "Well, that completes our financial review. Again, more information will be available in our 10-Q. We will be filing tomorrow.", "And now back to Gary.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. Looking forward, we remain cautiously optimistic about several macroeconomic factors. As per our second quarter and year-to-date results, we expect that growth in EMEA and the Americas will continue to more than offset any lower industrial activity and sales in Asia-Pacific. We also hope there will continue to be a relative stability in input costs and that our efforts to improve operations and sourcing will benefit our gross margin. We also expect the benefit we currently have in our margin will help offset unfavorable impacts we are beginning to see related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.", "Given this outlook, our guidance remains unchanged from what we shared with you in January. The following fiscal year 2014 guidance does not include any acquisitions or divestiture activity and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels. We expect our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $383 million to $398 million or growth of between 4% and 8% versus fiscal 2013. We project gross margin to be close to 51%.", "We expect our global advertising and promotional investment to be in the 6.5% to 7.5% of net sales. We expect income of $40.5 million to 42.8 million, which would achieve a diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.80 assuming 15.3 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "So, in summary, what did you hear from us in today's call? You heard, we increased sales by 8% in the second quarter and that double-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA more than offset the lower activity in our Asia-Pacific region. You heard we doubled sales of our Specialist product line and that we launched new offerings in Europe. You heard we grew gross margin by 70 basis points over the period and that we continue to be above our target.", "You heard that we continue to make progress on and benefit from our strategic initiatives, including new SKU launches to grow sales and aerosol can project reduce costs and programs to increase margins. You heard that we grew diluted earnings per share to $0.67 in the second quarter and returned capital to shareholders through the purchase of 239,501 shares at a cost to $17 million. You heard that our outlook is cautiously optimistic and that we are maintaining our guidance with sales growth of 4% to 8% for fiscal year 2014.", "In closing, I would like to share a quote with you from Franklin D. Roosevelt. The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.", "Thank you for joining us today. We would be pleased to now open the conference call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We will go first to Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam Burke - Janney Capital Markets", "Good afternoon, Garry. Good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hello, Liam.", "Liam Burke - Janney Capital Markets", "Garry, you said that Eastern Europe, or the distribution side of the European business was up 33%. A lot of those are smaller or more emerging markets. Do you see any similarities between those markets and the ones that you serve that are relatively more developed like China?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, there are a couple of big markets in that Eastern bloc, Liam. Places like Poland and Russia are in that bloc. So I think overall in Eastern Europe, we continue to see an increase of the people being aware and using more of our Blue and Yellow can, plus we are being pleased with the adoption of our Specialist product line in a number of countries, including Russia which was one of the first of those distributor markets to take on a range of Specialist earlier in the year.", "Liam Burke - Janney Capital Markets", "Do you see any conflict between a newer WD-40 introduction and Specialist or do you see them growing together?", "Garry Ridge", "We don't take Specialist into a market until the WD-40 core brand has a measured level of awareness and acceptance. We have to have that to get buy-in or to gain from leveraging what we call the power of the shield. But it is not unlikely that both could grow at similar rates in the initial period. Again, we believed, and still believe that Blue and Yellow can market is bigger than the Specialist market but we maybe learning that could be different in some places over time.", "Liam Burke - Janney Capital Markets", "Okay, and then on China, you spoke about how you have some cost savings on the aerosol cans. Is that production facility meeting your expectations and has it been running up to how you thought it would?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, absolutely. It's delivered as we wanted and is well placed to deliver the volumes that we need in the foreseeable future.", "Liam Burke - Janney Capital Markets", "Thank you, Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ben Richardson with JPMorgan.", "Ben Richardson - JPMorgan", "Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Ben.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hi, Ben.", "Ben Richardson - JPMorgan", "Just a quick question about the ERP implementation in Europe. Just any idea about possible savings and the timing of that implementation?", "Garry Ridge", "We are in the final pilot program. We expect to -- we will progressively implement it in different geographic areas over a year. All of the initial costs have been sunk costs. So we would think that it will be at least a year from now till it is fully operational in all of the geographies of Europe. It's more providing capacity than cost savings. As our business is growing substantially over there, we have needed more capacity to be able to facilitate the transactions. So, it's more really. There are obviously efficiencies but we don't think that it's going to reduce the number of people we have. In fact, we have probably increased a couple. So it's preparing us for the future growth.", "Ben Richardson - JPMorgan", "Okay, and then on the topic of share repurchase. It seems that you are going at a pretty good clip here, and what remains of the $60 million? And you mentioned that you will likely consider to buy - execute that throughout the year. But what might be the pace for that?", "Jay Rembolt", "We have targeted somewhere between 30 million to 35 million on an annual basis and that would effectively take us up through a couple months prior to our current authorization.", "Ben Richardson - JPMorgan", "Okay, and what remains at this point?", "Jay Rembolt", "$35 million.", "Ben Richardson - JPMorgan", "$35 million. Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Just a couple of quick questions, I guess on Asia-Pacific first. In terms of the weakness this quarter, you mentioned that there is a backlog of orders that you were supposed to ship in the first quarter got pushed back into the second. Could you quantify for us, or actually from the second to the third, could you quantify how much of those orders got pushed back?", "Garry Ridge", "We probably would have been reasonably flat if they would have shipped for the quarter, and they are all to distributor markets. So that was orders that was going to places other than Australia and China where we manufacture, but they are all distributor business.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay, and the way that you described it, it sounds like that those orders have not been shipped yet, as of April 8.", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, they\u2019ve shipped.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay, they have. And China, could you tell us what China did in the quarter year-over-year?", "Garry Ridge", "I think we mentioned it. You got another question while we find that?", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Yes, just in terms of gross margin, I think, year-to-date, you have done 51.8% or thereabouts. Your guidance is still around 51%. So maybe I am reading this too literally, but that would imply some decline both sequentially as well as year-over-year. So help us understand why we would see the decline in gross margin you guys are guiding to in the back half of the year?", "Garry Ridge", "We are not that good at forecasting the future. He who guides by the crystal ball gets the glass. So there is nothing significant there but we have got exchange rates. We have got volatility in oil prices, all of the normal things. But I think, as you might have gathered from the call we were potentially reasonably comfortable that we were going to be at least that way we are guiding. Jay, you had\u2026?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, essentially we left our guidance alone. We are very pleased that our margin is up over that 51%, but we really are guiding towards our bottom-line earnings and we left it alone. We feel fairly comfortable in that range.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay, and then in terms of Specialist, obviously you mentioned that it doubled year-over-year. A lot of that is coming from new distribution. I think Australia was part of that new distribution. Are there other big markets that you still have to go into with that brand over the six or 12 months or so?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, there is a number of aspects to that, Joe. Firstly is, it\u2019s not only the brand but it is the categories that we choose to go into. So we are not only increasing distribution of Specialist but in the United States, for example, we are still at early days. We continue to get more of the SKUs of the different categories into distribution. They are delivering excellent results for our retail as we are actually growing categories that we were not growing before. So our retailers are very comfortable with that. Specialist is a long, long road and we will be talking about it for as long as I am here, and probably longer than that. So we believe that is what we expected it would be which is our platform for leveraging the power of the shield. We are certainly delighted that we have doubled sales year-over-year. It's becoming a significant number now and now that we have seen that performance we gain more confidence about our ability to be able to very deliberately extend the brand, and I say the word \u2018deliberately\u2019 because this is not just slap that shield on anything. There is a lot of work been going on over the past many years and consistently and into the future about where we will take it. So the world, as you know, is our oyster. We can take things to more people and more places faster than anyone else now. We spent the last 10 years building up that distribution center globally and I think Specialist really shows how that having set up that distribution, we are able to take more things to more people and more places faster. So Specialist is - we are in a comfortable position with this and we feel good about the future.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks, Garry. Thanks, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co.", "Hi. First, can I just ask for a clarification on what you said on Asia? Did you mean that the whole Asia-Pacific segment would have been flat excluding the backorder issue? Or just the rest of Asia piece that was down 30%?", "Garry Ridge", "The rest of Asia. Well when you look at it, Australia was relatively flat anyhow, China was down and the rest of Asia would have been flat if would have shipped that backlog.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co.", "Okay. I got you. And then, well, just on that issue with the Indonesia distributor transition, I can't quite remember how long you have been talking about that, but when did that issue start to impact and when will we fully anniversary that disruption from that?", "Garry Ridge", "We changed the distributor in September last year. So we will lap at this September and what we are going through really is a ramp-up with the new distributor. So it took time to ship product in to our new distributor. There was, if you will, a gap in the market, but the in-market sales of good and it's just an event, its not a trend. We will be through it and on our way.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co.", "Okay, and then I was wondering, did you see any uptick in consumption demand in Philippines because of cleanup efforts there after the typhoon? And how does Philippines rank in terms of size of market for you? Is it one of the smaller or how does it rank versus like India and a few of those other markets there?", "Garry Ridge", "It would be a mid-size market as far as consumption is concerned in Asia-Pacific. India would be smaller than the Philippines because India is not as developed yet. We may have seen some. But I think as we have talked before, Linda, it would be very unusual to see a needle move, because of a particular geographic climatic condition that would be so obvious amongst the scheme of things. But yes, we always see an uptick in consumption but it is event driven and it is just an opportunistic result. But it normally doesn't make a huge difference. One of the reasons also is that the event happen and sometimes the product has to get to that region. They don't carry excess inventory hoping for a typhoon. So we may see some depletion of inventory and some top up later, but it's really hard to be able to focus in on one geographic area, particularly a country the size of Philippines and think that it might make a difference.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co.", "Okay, and then can you just talk, I think your normal habit is to redo some tin contracts in January. Can you give us some rough idea how that went? Does that bake in a lower tin cost, moderately lower, much lower, flatter? Can you give some color on that?", "And also, it seems like petroleum-based cost might be down a little bit since you last report? Would that be true? Thanks.", "Garry Ridge", "Actually today there, in the last few days they have been up. They are a little around 100 and a little over 100, where I think we last reported we were more into 90s, I think. But from a standpoint of the tin plate in our contracts, yes, in the U.S. we renegotiated our contract in the first quarter, in the first part of the year in January and essentially we saw no increase in the pricing this year. We had some negotiations that lowered our can costs at the very end of last year. So we are going into this year with lower can cost.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co.", "Great. And just one last thing. Did you say that the other expense item was more negative than in prior year because primarily of FX?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. We had gains on foreign currency transactions in the prior year whereas this year we had some foreign currency exchange losses.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co.", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Linda.", "Garry Ridge", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We will go next to Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about what you are seeing in terms of overall demand in Europe? Have you seen an uptick as many companies have seen? Or are your products not as affected by the economic turnaround that we expect?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, I think you will see that last year when Europe went through its economic challenges, was it last year, I think it was the year before. We also went sideways, not necessarily because of a lack of demand of our product but more as a result of activities of the retailers and distributors who sell our product. We have seen a steady increase in confidence over the past 18 months in Europe and that's being reflected in the results that you are seeing being delivered now. So we are very encouraged about our opportunities for long period of time into Europe and will weather the storms as they come and our products itself again is not necessarily that impacted by the end user. It's more impacted by the activities of the distributors and wholesalers.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "So when you look at what the activities of the distributors, and if you look sequentially on a monthly basis, since the beginning of the year are you seeing sequential improvement every month or it just doesn't work like that for you?", "Garry Ridge", "It doesn't work. We would have trouble over the many European countries that we are in tracking them month-by-month. Quarter-by-quarter would be the best but year-on-year, but yes, we have seen a general increase in business activity across most of the European markets, particularly one is Spain. Now Spain is a doing reasonably well right now and it was one of the worst performing markets 18 months ago. But our business in Spain has rebounded very significantly in the last year.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "All right. That is very helpful. Thank you. And I was wondering also, if your sales in the U.S. were affected by the bad weather we had or if that has no impact whatsoever?", "Garry Ridge", "I can't say it has no impact but certainly, if there was any impact, I think it might have been reflected in the sales. We had a good quarter. Certainly as customers can't get to stores to buy product, then we are not going to sell products. But we know that overall the conditions will be impacted like most others but there is nothing that we can say this did that.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay, and then lastly, if I may. Could you talk about whether the turmoil in Russia, Eastern Europe is affecting your revenues and whether you expect it to?", "Garry Ridge", "Not that we can see at this time. Whether it will or not, I don't know.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. So I turn the conference back over to Garry Ridge for any additional or closing remarks.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you so much. Thanks for all of those who have joined us. Thanks for the questions.

At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today's call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. My name is Wendy Kelley, and I'm very happy to be here today as one of WD-40 Company's newest tribe members. I look forward to interacting with many of you and my role is Director of Investor Relations in Corporate Communications.", "On the call today are WD-40 Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge; and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt. Following their prepared remarks, the operator will come back on the line for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings press release and current quarter corporate presentation are available on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.wd40company.com.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Good day. Thanks, Wendy, and thanks for joining us on today's conference call. Today we reported net sales of 95.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 3% over last year, and the highest revenue quarter in our company history.", "Year-to-date net sales were $285.4 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Net income for the third quarter was $10.4 million compared to $10.3 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.69 compared to $0.66 last year. Year-to-date net income was $32.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year period, and year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $2.10, up 4% from $2.01 in the prior fiscal year.", "Before we focus on the sales results, let's take a moment to review the progress we've made towards our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 multi-use product. Our goal under this first initiative is to take the WD-40 multi-use product to more places for more people with more uses.", "In line with this initiative, sales of WD-40 multi-use product increased 3% in the third quarter compared to last year. We grew multi-use product sales 14% in the EMEA segment, and 11% in our Asia-Pacific segment. Multi-use product sales decreased 8% in the Americas segment, primarily due to lowest sales activity in Canada and the U.S. Sales of our multi-use product were down by 9% in the U.S. and 17% in Canada. And I'll discuss the drivers of these changes in sales when I review the segment results later.", "Strategic driver number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories with the identified geographies and platforms. The WD-40 Specialist product line continue to perform well with greater than double-digit growth across all three segments, and with a global growth rate of 27% over the prior year third quarter. We continue to work on new formulations and delivery systems for future WD-40 Specialist products. We see WD-40 Specialist as a sustainable revenue and earnings growth engine for many years to come.", "Strategic driver number three is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within our company to derive revenues from new sources outside our flagship WD-40 brand. We continue to make excellent progress with the new SKUs we launched early this year under our 3-IN-ONE brand. We've been promoting the new products throughout many tradeshows, sponsorships, media coverage and print and media online.", "Strategic driver number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. We welcomed 10 new tribe members during the third quarter, and 36 year-to-date. During the quarter we conducted our biannual employee engagement survey, and we're delighted with the results. Our employee engagement score is a reflection of our tribe's dedication to the company and is the envy of many organizations at 93.7%.", "I'd like to share details from a couple of the questions we asked in that survey; 97.6% of our global tribe members answered the question they love to tell people they work at WD-40 Company, and 99.7% of that global tribe members told us they understand how their job contributes to achieving WD-40 Company's goals. When I see results like these, it's clear to me why our tribe consistently excels at achieving what we have set out to accomplish. It's so true that it's all about our people.", "In addition, our organization was recently recognized for the fourth consecutive year by WorldBlu as one of the most democratic workplaces for our high levels of innovation, accountability and transparency.", "And finally, we conducted our third-year of our leadership lab in June. This program was developed in support of our bench building initiatives and to assist the next generation of leaders within the organization to develop talents and skills for both professional growth and the company's performance. To all our tribe members listening to us all around the world today, thank you for your commitment to our values.", "Strategic driver number five is operational excellence. This initiative includes continuous improvement of optimizing resources, systems and processes in order to help offset rising cost and protect our gross margin. Operational excellence is also important to meet the ever-increasing customer and regulatory requirements.", "During the third quarter we completed our initial transition of a major upgrade about ERP system in EMEA. The operational enhancements associated with this upgraded ERP system are expected to significantly improve back-office operations within the segment. We also continue to make progress on the new global human resource information system, which we expect to go live by the end of this fiscal year.", "That completes the update on strategic drivers. So let's move on to the details of the third quarter year-to-date's results starting with sales. Sales in the multipurpose maintenance product category accounted for 89% of our global sales in the third quarter with the category sales up 3% in the third quarter and up 6% year-to-date. Products under this category include the brands of WD-40 and 3-IN-ONE, as well as sales of the WD-40 Bike product line.", "By trading block, sales of multipurpose maintenance products in the third quarter were down 7% in the Americas, up 13% in EMEA and up 11% in Asia-Pacific compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date sales of the multipurpose maintenance products are up 3% in the Americas, up 11% in EMEA and down 2% in Asia-Pacific.", "Homecare and cleaning products category accounted for 11% of global net sales in the third quarter with sales down just 1% in the third quarter and are down 8% year-to-date. Brands under this category include Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, and No Vac, 1001, X-14 and Lava and Solvol.", "By trading block, sales of homecare and cleaning products in the third quarter were up 1% in the Americas, down 9% in EMEA and down 1% in Asia-Pacific. Year-to-date sales of our homecare and cleaning products were down 10% in the Americas, down 5% in EMEA and down 5% in Asia-Pacific.", "Now, on to our results by segment starting with the Americas; sales in the Americas segment decreased 5% in the quarter, but were up 1% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 47% of global sales in the third quarter as compared to 51% in the prior year. Total U.S. sales were down 5% in the quarter, and up 2% year-to-date. Multipurpose maintenance products sales in the U.S. decreased 7% in the third quarter, and this was primarily due to timing of promotional activities.", "Homecare and cleaning product sales in the U.S. increased 4% in the third quarter driven by increased sales of 2000 Flushes and Spot Shot, which each increased by 5%. Year-to-date homecare and cleaning products sales declined 8%. As a remainder, homecare and cleaning products particularly those in the U.S. are considered harvest brands that continue to generate positive cash flows, but are becoming a smaller part of the business as net sales of multipurpose maintenance products grow per the execution of our strategic initiatives.", "Sales in Latin America were up 3% in the third quarter and are up 7% year-to-date driven by the higher multi-use product sales throughout the region. Now, to Canada; sales in Canada decreased 22% in the third quarter and 17% year-to-date. These declines are primarily due to some unusual short-term factors that negatively impacted sales, including Canada encountering the coldest winter in 35 years, as well as some challenges to distribution in the mass retail channels.", "Let's now go over the ocean and visit EMEA segment which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Sales in the EMEA segment were up 12% in the third quarter and are up 10% year-to-date. These sales increases in the third quarter were primarily driven by favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to remove these foreign currency impacts on sales, we also calculate sales on a constant currency basis. This means that we calculate sales for the current period using the exchange rates that were in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.", "On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA segment would have increased 2% in the third quarter, and are up 6% year-to-date. This segment accounted for 38% of global sales in the third quarter compared to 35% in the prior year quarter.", "We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct sales operations in certain countries, as well as through exclusive marketing distributors in other countries. Sales in our EMEA direct market were up 13% in the third quarter and are up 6% year-to-date. The sales growth in both periods was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.", "In local currencies, sales in the direct markets increased 3% in the third quarter due to increased sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line stemming from new distribution and the continued growth also of the WD-40 multi-use product. The direct markets accounted for 59% of EMEA's total sales in the third quarter, which is essentially flat compared to the prior year period.", "We sell through exclusive marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe and the Middle East, India and Africa with virtually all sales consisting of the WD-40 brand. Our distributor markets in total were up 11% in the third quarter and are up 16% year-to-date.", "The sales growth in the third quarter was primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In local currency sales the distributor markets increased 1% for the third quarter. The distributor markets accounted for 41% of EMEA's total sales in the third quarter, which was essentially flat compared to the prior year period.", "Now, let's take a look at the Asia-Pacific segment. Sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were up 10% in the third quarter and down 2% in the year-to-date. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates this time had an unfavorable impact on sales in the third quarter and year-to-date.", "On a constant currency basis, sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were up 13% in the third quarter and 2% year-to-date. The segment accounted for 15% of global sales on the third quarter and 14% year-to-date.", "Sales in Australia decreased 7% in the third quarter, were down 3% year-to-date, although reported sales decreased period by period to period sales increased on a constant currency basis due to the ongoing growth of our base business.", "Sales in China increased 24% in the third quarter and 7% year-to-date. The sales increase in the third quarter was attributed to the continued increase in promotional activity. We continue to focus on the long-term opportunities in China. But we expect to experience a lot of volatility on the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of ongoing distribution and shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "Sales throughout the rest of Asia increased 17% in the third quarter and are down 6% year-to-date. The increased sales in the third quarter were primarily driven by the backlog of customer orders at the end of the second quarter that we are able to ship early in the third quarter. Year-to-date sales in this region have been negatively impacted this year during the transition period of our marketing distributor in Indonesia.", "That's it for the sales update. I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to hand over to Jay, who will review the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Garry, thank you. In addition to the information presented on the call, we suggest that you review our Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31st, which we'll file tomorrow.", "First, let's review our 50-30-20 rule; those are the measures we use to guide our business. As you may recall the 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be at or above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target for that is 30% or less. And finally the 20 which represents EBITDA, if our gross margin is at or above 50% and our cost of business is 30% or less, our EBITDA will be at or above 20%. EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, the descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q and in our investor presentation.", "Now, let's look at the gross margin or the 50 in our 50-30-20 rule. Gross margin in the third quarter was essentially flat coming in at 51.4% compared to 51.3% in the prior year. The slight increase of 10 basis points in gross margin was driven by lower input cost as well as the impact of price increases and lower promotional discounts. These positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates and increased warehousing and transportation costs.", "Our cost of products sold, looking at our input costs, we experienced a favorable impact of 110 basis points from our major input cost changes. This was driven by changes in the cost of petroleum based materials along with the lower cost of cans in our EMEA and American segments. Changes in other input costs negatively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points.", "We consider and implement price increased on a country by country basis to help offset the impact from input cost increases. Period over period our gross margin improved by 30 basis points as a result of price increases implemented over the past 12 months in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.", "We also saw gross margin improvement of 30 basis points driven by our reduced advertising and promotional discounts primarily associated with our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentives, trade promotions and cash discounts that we give to our customers recorded as a reduction to sales. The timing and magnitude of these may cause fluctuations in our gross margin period-to-period.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates within our EMEA segment negatively impact our gross margin by 70 basis points. In EMEA, our cost of goods are sourced in Pound Sterling, while revenues are generated in Sterling, Euros and the U.S. Dollar. The value of the Euro and the U.S. Dollar both deteriorated versus the Pound Sterling. This caused revenues sourced in those currencies to be less than Pound Sterling, thus resulted in a decrease in the gross margin.", "Look at our warehousing and transportation costs primarily within our Americas segment had a negative impact on our gross margin over 50 basis points. This was driven in part by a specific promotion in the U.S. that started in the third quarter and will continue into the fourth quarter. That promotion includes the display configuration that has higher storage and transportation costs.", "In addition, transportation costs were also increased due to the higher fees associated with transportation disruptions caused by adverse weather conditions during the quarter. Other impacts to gross margin for the quarter includes sales mix and all other miscellaneous items, combined, these factors had an unfavorable impact of 30 basis points.", "The themes discussed for the quarter gross margin are similar to those for the year-to-date results. Gross margin year-to-date was 51.6% compared to 50.8% in the prior year. The increase of 80 basis points in gross margin was primarily attributable to the lower input costs along with the impact of price increases and lower promotional discounts. Again, these items were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of warehouse and transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and unfavorable sales mix.", "That concludes the gross margin discussion. Now, on to the 30 or our cost of doing business; in both the third quarter of this fiscal year and last year the cost of doing business remained at 34%. Year-to-date the cost of doing business was 34% this fiscal year up slightly from the 33% last year, while our goal is to have our cost of doing business at or below 30% of net sales. That percentage may fluctuate due to changes in the timing of sales, the timing of expenses, as well as investments we elect to make for our future.", "Year-to-date 71% of our cost of doing business came from three areas, 39% related to people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, 19% from our investments in marketing, advertising and promotion, and 13% in freight cost, the cost to get our product to our customers.", "Now, more details on our SG&A expenses. In the third quarter SG&A expense increase 5% to 26.9 million. As a percentage of net sales SG&A expense was 28.1% in the third quarter compared to 27.6% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher professional service costs, increased freight costs, and the impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.", "Professional service costs increased by $0.8 million due to legal fees associated with certain litigation matters along with various regulatory compliance items and additional investments we've made to protect our intellectual property. When you are in 188 countries around the world, all with unique and different laws, intellectual property protection can become a bit challenging.", "Brand protection in always a high priority and an investment of the company will continue to make in order to safeguard one of its most valuable assets, the blue and yellow can with the little red top.", "Also, contributing to the higher professional service fees during the quarter were some general consulting service costs associated with bringing online a new third-party contract manufacturer and operational support for the system upgrade both occurring in EMEA.", "Freight expense was up $0.3 million versus the prior year period due to higher sales volumes and the shift in the size of customer shipments. In the third quarter last year we had a higher volume of large shipments compared to this year. We gained efficiencies and realized savings when we can ship larger volume orders.", "Finally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had another favorable impact period to period increasing our SG&A cost by about $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by 0.8 million decline in employee related costs primarily associated with lower bonus expense compared to the prior year.", "Year-to-date SG&A was $80.2 million versus 74.9 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 28.1% year-to-date compared to 27.2% in the prior year period. The year-to-date increase in SG&A was primarily driven by increased employee-related expenses, higher professional service costs, increased freight, higher level of travel and entertainment expenses and a negative impact from foreign currency.", "Advertising and sales promotion decreased 3% in the third quarter to 6.5 million compared to the prior year. As a percent of sales, A&P investment was 6.8% in the third quarter compared to 7.1% in the prior year. The decrease and advertising and sales promotional expense was primarily associated with the lower level of promotional programs in the Americas. The lower advertising and sales promotion expense in the Americas was significantly offset by increased expenses in EMEA and Asia-Pacific due to the increased promotional activities in both these regions.", "Year-to-date advertising and sales expense was essentially flat at $18.1 million compared to $18 million in the prior year. Advertising and sales promotion expense as a percent of sales decreased to 6.3% from 6.5%. The slight change in advertising and sales promotion expense year-to-date was primarily due to the higher level of promotional activities in EMEA.", "As a reminder, it is common for advertising and sales promotion expense to fluctuate period to period based on the type of marketing activity or the promotion we employ within any given period.", "Amortization of our intangible assets increased to 0.7 million in the third quarter compared to 0.5 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date amortization was 1.9 million compared to 1.5 million last year. The increase in amortization in primarily due to the change in remaining usable life of the 2000 Flushes trade name, which was made in Q3 of last year.", "Total operating expenses in the current year quarter were 34 million versus 32.8 million last year. And operating income in the third quarter was 15.1 million compared to 15 million last year.", "Year-to-date total operating expenses were 100.2 million versus 94.4 million last year. Operating income year-to-date was 47.1 million up from the 45.3 million last year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50-30-20 measures was 17% of net sales in both the current and prior year quarter. Year-to-date EBITDA was 18% of net sales in both the current and prior year period. We target EBITDA at 20% of net sales that expect variations from time to time as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate.", "Our EBITDA percentage again is also affected by investments we make fur future growth. Our interest in income and interest expense remained constant in the third quarter as compared to the prior fiscal year period. Net interest expense increased to 0.3 million year-to-date as a result of our increased borrowings on our line of credit.", "Other net expenses remain constant in the third quarter, but increased $0.9 million year-to-date. The change is primarily due to the fluctuations in exchange rates for the Pound Sterling against the Euro and the U.S. Dollar. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of 0.4 million in the current year compared to foreign currency exchange gains of 0.5 million, last year.", "The provision for income taxes in the third quarter was 30.4 million versus 30.6 million in the prior year. The slight decrease in rate was driven by an increase in the domestic production deduction in the current year quarter. Year-to-date the provision for the income taxes was 30.6% in both the current and prior year periods.", "Net income in the third quarter was 10.4 million versus 10.3 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted the translation of our results by $0.3 million. Our third quarter results translated at last year's exchange rates or what we would term constant currency basis would have produced net income of 10.1 million versus the 10.4 million this year.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $0.69 in the third quarter compared to $0.66 in the prior fiscal quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.6 million shares to 15.1 million shares. And year-to-date net income was $32.2 million versus 31.7 million in the prior year. Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on the translation of our results year-over-year.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $2.10 year-to-date compared to $2.01 in the prior fiscal year period, with diluted shared outstanding decreasing from 15.7 million to 15.2 million shares this year.", "Look at our balance sheet at May 31st, our balance sheet continues to remain solid as our cash and term deposits exceed our debt. As of May 31st, our cash and cash equivalents were $44.9 million and we had $45.4 million in short-term investments, which consist of term deposits and callable time deposits held at monies in our banks.", "The current portion of debt under our existing line of credit was $83 million up from the 73 million in the second quarter of this year. The $10 million increase in the line of credit balance during the third quarter was primarily used for share repurchase activity.", "A word about our capital allocation, we continue to focus on returning capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Regarding the dividend, on June 24th the board of declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share, payable July 31, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 11, 2014. Based on today's closing price of 76.11, the annualized dividend yield will be 1.8%.", "As for our share repurchases, we acquired approximately 111,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 8.2 million during the third quarter, these share were acquired under our latest share repurchase plan approved by the board of directors in June of 2013. It provides authorization to acquire up to $60 million of the company's outstanding shares through the plan's end date of August 2015.", "To date, we've repurchased approximately 474,000 shares at a total cost of $33.2 million under the share repurchase plan. We continue to expect to be executing on this program throughout the remainder of the year.", "Well, that includes a financial overview. More information will be available on Form 10-Q, which we will file tomorrow. And thanks so much, and now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Jay. We remain cautiously optimistic about several macroeconomic factors. We expect to see continued growth driven by our strategic initiatives which should help drive a solid end of this fiscal year. We hope that we will continue to see relatively stable input costs, and that our efforts to improve operations in-sourcing will continue to benefit our gross margin and operating results.", "Given this in our outlook and the proximity to the yearend we have upgraded our guidance from that that we shared with you in April. The following fiscal year 2014 guidance does not include any acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that the foreign currency exchange rate will remain close to the recent levels. So for the year we expect our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of 380 million to 387 million or a growth of between 3% and 5%.", "We now project our gross margin to be close to 51.5%. We expect global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 6% and 7% of net sales. We therefore expect net income of between 41 million and 43 million, which will achieve a diluted EPS of between $2.70 and $2.83 assuming 15.2 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "In summary, what did you hear from us today? You've heard we increased sales by 3% in the third quarter. You've heard that consistent with our strategic initiative we saw double-digit growth of sales of our WD-40 Specialist product line within all three of our trading blocks. You've heard that we grew gross margin by 10 basis points. You've heard that we grew diluted earnings per share to $0.69 and return capital to shareholders through the purchase of approximately 111,000 shares at a cost of 8.2 million. And you heard that our outlook is cautiously optimistic and that we are updating our full year guidance.", "In closing, as I do, I'd like to share a quote with you from -- this time from Walter Bowie, \"The mightiest works have been accomplished by men who have kept their ability to dream great dreams.\" Thank you for joining us today. We'll be pleased to now open the conference call to any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Good afternoon, Garry. Good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hi, Liam.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Garry, you talked about timing of promotional activities in the Americas and how it affected third quarter sales, and then Jay alluded to the additional inventory carry on these -- related to these promotions. Are these in traditional WD-40 brands, are they in Specialist or are they both?", "Garry Ridge", "The majority of them, Liam, would be in traditional WD-40 brand, the multi-use product, and we are seeing those promotional activity spread over both the third and the fourth quarter.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And -- I'm sorry.", "Garry Ridge", "More so in the fourth than in the third.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. You mentioned the European implementation and the Asia-Pacific; do you anticipate any expense lag or any operational setbacks there?", "Garry Ridge", "It was actually in EMEA, Liam.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "I am sorry, EMEA.", "Garry Ridge", "And it was the planned first stage of the execution of the new ERP system that we've been working on there for a couple of year now. We're facing in the actual implementation, we are in Phase I. It went as planned. Now, we don't expect any additional material cost from that. It all takes about nine months to have it completely embedded, but so far so good.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you. And, Jay, on the cash flow statement, it was down year-over-year on the working capital line, specifically current liabilities. Is there anything unusual in there or is it just timing?", "Jay Rembolt", "It's really just timing. We'd expect to see it normalize to about our average.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Hi. I'm sorry if you explained this with the last question, but I'm not sure I understand about the promotional activity in the Americas, because on the one hand you said that displays or transporting them or something hurt your gross margin and yet there was no promotional activity that really drove your sales. So, I'm a little confused about that. Do you expect that sales uptick to happen next quarter as a result of that cost to have those promotions, or can you explain a little bit more?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. Linda, yes, the answer is yes. What Jay was speaking about was the transport and warehousing activities to get the product into our distribution centers, not the transport and warehouse activities to get it to our customers. And also, some of the product that we are building there has a higher cost because of the display configurations that we have, some of which expenses are expensed earlier than later. So, yeah, we'd expect that as in line with our guidance we'd have a reasonably solid fourth quarter particularly in the U.S.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Great, thank you. And then, can you just explain a little bit more about Canada? And can you clarify; did you say Canada MPMP sales were down 78% of the quarter? Is that correct?", "Garry Ridge", "I think it was 17.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Seventeen, okay.", "Garry Ridge", "Yeah.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "So, Canada is about, I don't know, 16 million a year or 4 million a quarter of sales.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "So, I guess I am just wondering, so if it was down 17% in the quarter, I mean that's not a huge variance on sales because of Canada. I mean it affected the quarter, but not in a large way, so \u2026 ", "Garry Ridge", "Yeah, it's event-driven. Canada just had the worst winter in 35 years, and without pushing the random excuse generator and blaming weather, that did cause some distribution issues and so people wouldn't just go into stores. In fact in the quarter it was down 22 and down 17 year-to-date. The other thing that impacts us in Canada and this has been out there for some time now. We did a -- in the retail trade channel, we did a voluntary recall of our smart store delivery system due to some regulations in Canada. And that happened earlier on this year.", "So we are missing the sales of smart store in the retail channel. We are still selling it through the industrial trade channel. So it will take us a little time to lap that, but that's really the two main impacts that happened in Canada.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay, great. And then, if I look at your change in the guidance for the year with the raising of the EPS guidance and I guess the gross margin guidance, I actually had, I think the consensus had the gross margin around 51.5 already for the year. So when we look at our models, I guess to raise EPS, we would lower maybe the A&P and/or the SG&A expense in the fourth quarter. So am I thinking of that the right way?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, I think two things will happen. Where we end up with sales, we've narrowed that a little bit. But, correct, we would hope that gross margin would have a positive impact, and we would therefore -- we expect, if you look at the trending of A&P that may come down a little bit. But I think those are levers. We feel like we'll have a reasonably solid year-on-year sales growth. We see margin improving, and we see good management of our A&P expenses, and we think we are well positioned to step up next year in a pretty fine way.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "", "Okay, great. And then on, just one final question on WD-40 Specialty line, you've said strong growth, I think you said up 27% in the quarter, is that right?", "Garry Ridge", "That is accurate.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "", "So that's strong. But I think last quarter you said it had doubled year-over-year. So \u2026 ", "Garry Ridge", "That's accurate also.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "", "Okay. I mean it's slowing or is that just a quarter-by-quarter fluctuation?", "Garry Ridge", "This is going to bounce around for a while. There is no way it's slowing. We get selling, then we get new customers and then of course as we introduce new categories we're going to get spurts, but we're very, very happy with Specialist. As I said in my remarks, we are confident that Specialist will be a solid revenue and earnings machine for us for many years to come as we execute the program in a deliberate way across the markets of the world at a time that's it's appropriate.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Linda.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Sidoti and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo - Sidoti", "Just one quick follow-up on the Specialist; it was up 27% in the quarter, was there any one region that it's outperforming the others or maybe you're satisfied with that, specifically how is it doing in the Americas?", "Garry Ridge", "Very fine; it's very good. We're comfortable that it's doing fine in all areas that we've launched it, and the growth depends too on what we launch into what areas and what regions at what time, but overall we're very comfortable.", "Daniel Rizzo - Sidoti", "I mean early in the quarter was there any one reason that outperform the others?", "Garry Ridge", "No, not necessarily. And again, it's off the basis or the base that it's performing of differs from region-to-region. So we think overall that we're going to get fluctuations from region-to-region. We don't talk about what's going on in each region. We're looking at the overall growth, and we are very happy with 27% growth quarter-over-quarter.", "Daniel Rizzo - Sidoti", "And one more quick question; you indicated on a call in the press release that those higher expenses are related to, I guess, protecting intellectual property rights. I'd assume that's not something new, that's kind of -- it's an ongoing thing that's been happening \u2026 ", "Garry Ridge", "For many, many, many years we have a robust intellectual property protection program that's been put in place for many years. There hasn't been really any changes to it other than we've just got more activity, but intellectual property protection to us is a real and focused activity, and as I said we just continue to do. When we are in the 188 countries around the world, as Jay mentioned with different laws and different regulations, it takes some work.", "Daniel Rizzo - Sidoti", "The fact that you mentioned it for this quarter, does that mean it's uptick, it's been more of initial recently versus in the past or is it just -- I mean is it just pretty much been the same?", "Garry Ridge", "No, run rate is about the same, but we mentioned it, because it's a very, very important part of our business, and we actually -- we want people to know that we are investing and protecting one of, if not the most important asset we have in the company.", "Daniel Rizzo - Sidoti", "Okay. All right, thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Did volumes grow in the quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "Overall, not much.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "But they were slightly positive?", "Garry Ridge", "Slightly positive, yes. We haven't had any pricing really, but the two -- the other impact was exchange rates, but certainly volumes are growing year-over-year. And we expect that we will have volume growth for the full year definitely.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Because I felt that there was a positive price benefit, and I thought there was a positive price benefit and I thought that the sales not adjusted for currency were flat and so that's why I'd have thought that volumes were down a little bit.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay. There might be a slight decrease in volumes. You're right. There was a slight impact from the price increases. And you're right, adjusted for currency we're flat period-on-period on the quarter. Year-to-date, we are up quite a bit. So I think -- yeah, that's \u2026 ", "Jay Rembolt", "But the other side of that too Jeff is we actually measured consumable ounces and depending on where those ounces are sold, that tells us -- reflects our volume growth. So, volume growth for the year is definitely up in ounces across the globe.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Right. So, in the fourth quarter of last year or -- let me try this a different way. Does your management compensation in the fourth quarter changed a lot as to whether you report to 70 or 283? \u2013or it does not matter in terms of bonus compensation?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. Depending on where we end up according to our targets, we will have an impact in the fourth quarter, either positive or negative if we exceed or miss our targets in any significant way.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Like this last year in the fourth quarter you really had a step up in SG&A expense \u2026 ", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, we did have. As we hit those higher targets of last year's growth rate, yes.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "So, do you expect your SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter to be up or down year-over-year?", "Garry Ridge", "We haven't shared that.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Shared that, okay.", "Jay Rembolt", "It's Jay, I'll just add to that, Jeff. We wouldn't expect the change in compensation to be as dramatic this year as it was last year.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Right. Are you selling your homecare business or you're not selling it?", "Garry Ridge", "At this stage we are not selling it. I mean we are selling the products, but it's not a long-term part of our business. We've looked at about a year and a half ago. We did quite an in-depth evaluation of what we should do with it. And the outcome was we can generate more cash from it over time. If we sold anything it would primarily be that in the U.S., and only some of the brands. We're quite happy with what we're doing with 1001 in the U.K. at this time, and also in Australia. So, we've stabilized that business now. And as other part of our business grows it becomes less and less.", "The other thing is that we made a very deliberate decision some time ago to redirect all of the R&D and product development away from that group and pour it into Specialist and Bike, which is now paying benefits as we continue to grow Specialist.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Will Canada come back in the fourth quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "Canada will have a disappointing year only because of the events so far. But Canada will come -- it will be a reasonable quarter we think, but we will see Canada bounce back next year as we start to launch some more new product and we get over some of the challenges they've had this year.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Because of the timing of promotions, do you expect the U.S. business to come back in the fourth quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jeff. Nice to hear you.", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "My pleasure.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Hey, guys, good afternoon.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "I just want to dive into the top line, obviously you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but it was a little bit lighter than we were looking for in the quarter, it sounds like based in your commentary, Garry, that by and large the quarter was as expected in terms of where you guys were at, but for Canada, and obviously Canada is not a big piece of your business. So I'm just curious, one, is that a fair way to look at how the quarter played out? And then, two, I mean obviously you're now looking for 3% to 5% top line growth versus 4% to 8%, so it sounds like something changed in the quarter, we're trying to figure out is it the U.S. because it sounds like it was more of a timing issue this quarter, but it sounds like there are other underlying issues there.", "Garry Ridge", "Well, let me back up a little bit. You asked me a lot of questions there rolled into one. I think that we would have liked a little stronger quarter in revenue. It patted out a little bit towards the end, and it's not -- and really it was files falling from quarter-to-quarter as they do so. There is nothing we're really worried about. So, I think that if things would have come into the third quarter we would have had a stronger one, and we might have had a little high overall expectation. So I think just as we've got through the year, we're fine.", "I think also we are still flipping through some of the changes we made in Asia, and then we've also had that little upset in Canada. So, if you roll those things together, yes, I think we could have expected a little higher overall revenue growth in the full year than we are going to get now, although it's going to be a great year. This quarter was the largest quarter in the sales history of the company. We're very much looking forward to our first $100 million quarter, and we will publicly open a bottle of lemonade when we do that. But I think overall we are okay.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay. But it wasn't just timing, but it did lower the full year guidance, it wasn't just pushing revenue from 3Q to 4Q for example?", "Garry Ridge", "But it pushes it out to the other end as well.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay, 1Q.", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. So, I think that's really where it sits at the moment.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay.", "Garry Ridge", "And once you get through three quarters, you've got a better feel of what the whole year is going to be. So -- and again, we are not dumb enough to run our business in 90-day intervals.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Good to hear. Two other questions, I guess on new products, any update on Bike, number one? And number two, what's your thought on rolling out additional products beyond Bike? I mean do you want to see how Bike does first, or are you going to be more aggressive in fiscal '15 on that front?", "Garry Ridge", "We will be launching Bike in Europe at Interbike coming up in a couple of week's time. We are very happy with the Motorbike business that we've launched in Europe. And we'll be expanding distribution of our overall Bike products as we move further into this fourth quarter next year. We are in the Bike business to stay. It's got a lot of positives in that. It helps us engage a very large group of passionate end users particularly helping us get into the used area. We think any of that recreational area where lubrication and protection and cleaning is important helps us replace that connection you had, Joe, when you were first introduced to WD-40 when you head your head under the bonnet of the car with your dad.", "That doesn't happen any more. And we are -- at least not in the U.S. It certainly does happen in some of the more emerging markets, but we believe that this is a very strategic and important step in continuing to enhance the relevance of the brand across many generation. So -- and we've seen that evidence already. The Bike activity has been very positive towards the brand.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay, and in terms of the cadence of new products?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. In the Bike range of products, it will probably remain fairly stable. But in Specialist, which is really the other side, we will be continuing for many years to come to introduce categories of products. We are just shipping WD-40 Specialist Lawn and Garden in Australia in the next month or so. We are testing that down there as you know, we are happy so far with the response we are getting. We've done Motorbike in the U.K. We've extended the range of products in Specialists in the U.S. But this is deliberate. We are not going to be like a blind dog in a meat house here. This is a very valuable shield, and we will not slap it on anything. It will be deliberate and controlled and ensuring that we continue to keep our promise to our end users, which is delivering above expectation performance at great value.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "When could we see Lawn and Garden in the U.S. dealing?", "Garry Ridge", "I don't know. It depends how it proves out in Australia.", "Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Joe.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions, as well as our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley - Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge; and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt. Following their prepared remarks, the operator will come back on the line for the Q&A portion of our call.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings press release and current quarter corporate presentation are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.wd40company.com.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Wendy. Good day and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of $97.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, an increase of 4% over last year. Full fiscal year net sales were $383 million, also an increase of 4% over the prior year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $11.5 million compared to $8.1 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.77 compared to $0.53 last year. The full fiscal year net income was $43.7 million compared to $39.8 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year were $2.87, up 13% from $2.54 in the prior fiscal year and a record high for the company.", "Before we focus on the sales results, let\u2019s review the progress we have made towards our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our goal under the first initiative is to take the WD-40 Multi-Use Product to more places for more people with more uses. In line with this initiative, global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product increased by about 5% in both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year driven by our geographic expansion, increased distribution and a high level of promotional activities. During the fiscal year, we grew multi-purpose product sales by 12% in EMEA segment and 1% in the Americas and Multi-Use Product sales decreased about 2% in the Asia-Pacific segment.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories within identified geographies and platforms. The WD-40 Specialist product line continued to perform well with double-digit growth across all segments and with global growth at global growth rate of 34% for the full fiscal year. Although each market, country and trading block experiences different short-term trends related to the sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line, the strong long-term growth rates we are seeing make it clear that WD-40 Specialist should be a substantial revenue and earnings growth engine for many years to come.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within our company to derive revenue from new sources outside of our flagship WD-40 brand. In early September 2014, we announced the acquisition of the GT85 brand, a multi-purpose maintenance products primarily sold in the United Kingdom in the cycling channels. Though we did not expect to see any significant contribution from the brand into our financials in the near term, there is a strategic element to the acquisition. GT85 and WD-40 BIKE share a similar base of customers and end users who trust and respect both brands. We believe we can leverage GT85\u2019s channel strength to expand the growth of WD-40 BIKE in the UK. We have used this go-to-market strategy with other products in our portfolio over time.", "Also falling under this strategic initiative in the fourth quarter, Australia will launch four products under the WD-40 Specialist Lawn & Garden product line, which includes a range of specially formulated products to clean, lubricate and protect ones\u2019 gardening tools and equipment. The launch in Australia was considered a part of launch and its outcome will impact our decisions in the future on whether we expand WD-40 Specialist Lawn & Garden in other geographies.", "Our strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding Tribe members. We were pleased to welcome 15 new Tribe members during the fourth quarter and 45 during the fiscal year ended this year with a total of 395 Tribe members globally. Our organization continues to be focused and deliberate in its recruitment, development and retention efforts. We offered our Tribe members several development opportunities in fiscal 2014 and these opportunities were well-received by our Tribe globally.", "During the fourth quarter, our leadership laboratory was recognized by Elearning! Media Group when it ranked it third on the list of 100 organizations which are recognized for the best-in-class learning and development programs and for leaning culture. In fiscal year 2014, our Tribe members delivered another year of solid progress and exceptional results. I am thrilled that these solid financial results will also allow us to reward our Tribe members for all of the hard work they have put in to making our products available to more people in more places with more uses everyday.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. This initiative includes the continuous improvement of optimizing resources, systems and processes in order to help offset rising costs and protect our operating margin. Operational excellence is also important to meet our ever increasing customer and regulatory requirements. During the fourth quarter, we completed our initial transition into our new global human resource information system, which should greatly enhance our ability to operate as one world, one company, and one tribe.", "During the full fiscal year, we saw many other successes with this initiative. We completed the initial transition to a major upgrade of our ERP system in our EMEA business segment. We managed a smooth transition to a lower VOC, a volatile organic compound formula in California to meet new regulatory requirements. We also completed a can sourcing project with a focus on the Americas and we improved the operational efficiency within our supply chain network. That completes the update on our strategic initiatives.", "So, let\u2019s move on to the details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year results starting with sales. We continue to be well-positioned for substantial growth of our multi-purpose maintenance products. We focus our time, talent, treasure in this area of our business, which accounted for 87% of our global sales in the fourth quarter. Sales of our multi-maintenance products were up about 5% in both the quarter and the full fiscal year, which is in line with our long-term target. As a reminder, products under this category include WD-40 Multi-Use Product, WD-40 Specialist and 3-IN-ONE brand as well as sales of our newest member of the brand family WD-40 Bike. By trading block, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products in the fourth quarter were down 2% in the Americas, up 11% in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific. For the full year, sales of our multi-purpose maintenance products were up 2% in the Americas, up 11% in the EMEA and flat in Asia-Pacific.", "The homecare and cleaning products category accounted for 13% of sales in the fourth quarter with category sales up 4% in the fourth quarter and down 5% for the fiscal year. Brands out of this category includes Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh No \u2013 and No Vac, 1001, X-14, Lava and Solvol. By trading block, sales of homecare and cleaning products in the fourth quarter were up 1% in the Americas, up 9% in EMEA and up 15% in Asia-Pacific. For the full fiscal year, sales of homecare and cleaning products were down 7% in the Americas, down 2% in EMEA and down 1% in Asia-Pacific. As a reminder, our homecare and cleaning products particularly those in the U.S. are considered to be harvest brands that continue to generate positive cash flows but are becoming a smaller part of our business as net sales of our multi-purpose maintenance products grow within the execution of \u2013 with the execution of our strategic initiatives.", "Now, onto the results by segment with the Americas, sales in the Americas segment decreased 2% in the fourth quarter but were essentially flat for the fiscal year. The segment accounted for 48% of global sales in both the quarter and 48 \u2013 sorry 48% in the fourth quarter and 47% in fiscal year. Multi-purpose maintenance product sales in the U.S. decreased 2% in the fourth quarter, were up 2% for the fiscal year. Sales of multi-purpose maintenance products in the U.S. decreased in the fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of promotional activities for the multi-purpose maintenance product. For the full fiscal year the sales increase in the U.S. was due to increased promotional activities, increased distributions as well as increased sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line. Homecare and cleaning product sales in the U.S. increased nearly 5% in the fourth quarter, but were down almost 5% for the full year. The increase in the fourth quarter was driven by increased sales of 2000 Flushes and Spot Shot, which each decreased by more than 5%.", "Sales in Latin America were up 6% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the full fiscal year driven by strong organic growth of our multi-purpose maintenance products through the region. Sales in Canada decreased by 15% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full fiscal year, these declines are primarily due to some unusual short-term factors including the previously shared voluntary recall in Canada, which has negatively impacted our distribution to mass retail accounts for the Smart Straw delivery system. Although the recall itself is behind us, it takes time to rebuild the channels with alternative product after an event of this kind, we expect the region will regain momentum in the coming quarters.", "Now over to our EMEA segment, sales in the EMEA segment were up 11% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full fiscal year. The sales increase in EMEA in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to show the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange on sales we calculate sales on a constant currency basis. Constant currency represents the translation of our current fiscal year sales from local currencies to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA segment would have been flat in the fourth quarter and increased 4% for the full fiscal year. The segment accounted for 41% of global sales in the fourth quarter and 40% for the full fiscal year. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through exclusive marketing distributors. Sales in our EMEA direct markets were up 8% in the fourth quarter and up 7% for the full fiscal year.", "In pound/sterling, sales in the direct markets decreased 3% in the fourth quarter but increased 1% for the full fiscal year. The direct markets accounted for 62% of EMEA\u2019s total sales in fiscal year 2014 compared to 64% last year. We sell through exclusive marketing distributors in Eastern and Northern Europe, in the Middle East, India and Africa and virtually all sales consistent with WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our distributed markets in total were up 16% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Although the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to this double-digit sales growth, pound/sterling sales still increased 5% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full fiscal year. This increase was driven by higher sales of our WD-40 Multi-Use Product in the Eastern Europe and Russia as a result of increased promotional activity and organic growth. The distributor markets accounted for 38% of EMEA\u2019s total sales for the full fiscal year compared to 36% last year.", "Now, the Asia-Pacific segment, sales in the Asia-Pacific segment were up 12% in the fourth quarter but were flat for the full fiscal year. The increase in sales in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by expanded distribution and increased promotional activities associated with the WD-40 Multi-Use Product and the continued expansion of the WD-40 Specialist product line in the region. Although organic growth favorably impacted the full year\u2019s results, this growth was completely offset by unfavorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in Australia. On a constant currency basis, sales in the Asia-Pacific area \u2013 region were up 4% for the full fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not affect sales in Asia-Pacific when compared to the prior year. The segment accounted for 30% of global sales in fiscal year 2014 compared to 40% last year.", "Sales in Australia increased 14% in the fourth quarter and 1% for the full fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales for the full fiscal year but did not materially impact the fourth quarter results. On a constant currency basis sales increased 11% for the full fiscal year. Growth in the region was driven by the launch of WD-40 Specialist and organic growth of the base business.", "Sales in China increased 1% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. The increase in the quarter and for the full year was probably due to the higher levels of sales associated with promotional activities. We continue to focus on the long-term opportunities in China, but we expect to experience a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting of economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "Sales throughout the rest of Asia increased 24% in the fourth quarter but decreased 3% year-to-date. The increased sales in the fourth quarter were driven by higher sales and increased distribution of the WD-40 Specialist product line and increased promotional activities for the WD-40 Multi-Use Product in the region. Full fiscal year sales in the region have been negatively impacted by the transition to a new marketing distributor in Indonesia for full fiscal year 2014.", "Thank goodness that\u2019s it for the sales update because I need to drink water now, over to Jay, who will continue to review the financials.", "Jay Rembolt - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks so much, Garry. In addition to the information that we are presenting on the call today, we also suggest that you review our Form 10-K for the year which will be filed next Tuesday. First, we would like to start with the review of our 50/30/20 rule, which really are the measures we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at or below 30% of net sales. And finally the 20 represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is above 50% and our cost of doing business is 30% or less, our EBITDA will be above 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-K and in our investor presentation which is available on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, a look at our gross margin or the 50 in our 50/30/20 rule. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 52.7% compared to 53% in the prior fiscal year period. The slight decrease in gross margin was driven by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates in EMEA, which were partially offset by a decrease in input costs. Though we cannot control the impacts of foreign currency on our results, we continue to be focused and deliberate on managing the rest of our business for growth in our gross margin.", "A look at our input cost. We experienced a net favorable impact of 50 basis points from our major input costs. This was driven by changes in the cost of petroleum-based materials along with the lower cost of cans in our EMEA segment. At times, we consider and implement price increases on a country by country basis to help offset the impact from cost increases. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin improved by 20 basis points as the result of price increases that have been implemented over the past 12 months in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific segments.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rate within our EMEA segment had a negative impact on gross margins of 110 basis points. In EMEA, our cost of goods are sourced in pound/sterling, while revenues are generated in euros, pound/sterling and the U.S. dollar. The value of the euro and the U.S. dollar both deteriorated versus the pound/sterling. This caused revenues sourced in those currencies to be worth less in pound/sterling, thus resulting in the decrease to gross margin.", "Gross margin year-to-date was 51.9% compared to 51.3% in the prior year, which is the highest annual gross margin we have seen in the last decade. The increase of 60 basis points in gross margin for the year was primarily attributed to the lower input cost along with the impact of price increases and lower promotional discounts. These favorable items were partially offset by the foreign currency exchange impacts in our EMEA segment as well as some higher warehousing and distribution costs in the Americas.", "Well, that completes the gross margin now on to the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the fourth quarter, our cost of doing business was 35%. This is an improvement from the 38% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full fiscal year, cost of doing business was 34% compared to 35% last year. While the goal is to have our cost of doing business at or below 30% of net sales, we plan to continue our investments in new product development, brand protection, regulatory and quality assurance. And as a result, we expect our cost of doing business to remain near current levels through fiscal year. We expect to move closer to our target of 30% over time as revenues grow. Year-to-date, 69% of our cost of doing business came from three areas: 39% is related to our people costs or the investments we make in our Tribe; 18% from our investments in marketing, advertising and promotional activities; and 12% in freight costs to get our products to our customers.", "Now, here is some little bit more detail on our SG&A expenses. In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense decreased by 4% to $28.3 million compared to the prior period. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 29% in the fourth quarter compared to 31.5% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily driven by lower employee related costs, which decreased $2 million compared to the prior year primarily due to lower earned incentive payments, which were partially offset by increased salaries resulting from our increased employee base and annual merit increases. These lower employee related costs were partially offset by an $800,000 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.", "For the full fiscal year, SG&A expense increased $4.2 million or 4% to $108.6 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense was 28.3% for both fiscal years. The increase in SG&A is primarily driven by higher professional service costs, a higher level of travel and meeting expense, increased freight costs, higher depreciation as well as the negative impact from changes in foreign currency. A significant portion of these increases were a result of increased professional service costs of $1.1 million primarily due to legal fees associated with certain litigation and regulatory compliance matters as well as increases in general consulting fees. Also contributing to the increase was travel and meeting expense in support of our strategic initiatives, which increased $600,000 during the year.", "Freight expense was up $300,000 versus the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and a higher depreciation of $300,000 was primarily due to our investments in computers, systems and other capital assets to support our business operations. And finally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact increasing SG&A by $1.4 million over the prior period. Similarly, last year in fiscal \u2013 similar to last year in fiscal 2014, we invested $6.9 million in research and new product development activities we believe that by continuing to focus on innovation and renovation we will strengthen the foundation for future growth.", "Advertising and sales promotion expense decreased by 15% in the fourth quarter to $5.8 million compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales, A&P investment was 6% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.3% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily associated with both lower cost and lower level of promotional programs in the Americas. For the full fiscal year, advertising and sales promotion expense was $23.9 million compared to $24.8 million in the prior year.", "Advertising and sales promotional expense as a percent of sales decreased to 6.2% from 6.7%. This was again driven by the lower cost of promotional programs in the Americas, particularly those associated with our home care and cleaning products. As a reminder, it is common for our advertising and sales promotion expense to fluctuate period-to-period based on the type of marketing activity or promotion we employ during any given period.", "Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased in total by $1.2 million to $700,000 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.9 million in the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to the $1.1 million impairment that we recorded to our 2000 Flushes trade name in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, amortization and impairment of tangible assets decreased in total by $700,000 to $2.6 million compared to the $3.3 million last year. This decrease was again due to the prior year 2000 Flushes impairment charge. This was partially offset by increased amortization expense resulting from a change to the remaining useful life of this trade name in Q3 of last year.", "Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $34.9 million versus $38.1 million last year. And operating income in the fourth quarter was $16.6 million compared to $11.4 million in the prior year. Year-to-date total operating expenses were $135.1 million versus $132.5 million last year. Operating income year-to-date was $63.7 million compared to the $56.6 million last year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures, was 18% of net sales in both the fourth quarter of this year and the prior year. For the full fiscal year, EBITDA was also 18% of net sales, an improvement over the 17% in the prior fiscal year. We target EBITDA to be at above the 20% of net sales, but expect variations from time-to-time as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. It is also affected by the investments we make for future growth.", "Interest income, interest expense and other net expense in total remained relatively constant for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. For the full fiscal year, however, the \u2013 it increased by $1 million. This increase was due to interest expense which increased by $300,000 as a results of increased borrowings on our line of credit and other expense, which increased $800,000 primarily due to fluctuations in the exchange rates. In fiscal 2014, we recorded foreign exchange losses whereas we had recorded gains in the prior year. The provision for income tax in Q4 was 30.4% versus the 27.6% in the prior fiscal year quarter. The higher tax rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of income in the U.S. which is taxed at higher rates. Year to date, the provision for income taxes was 30.5% versus 30% in the prior fiscal year period.", "Net income in the fourth quarter was $11.5 million versus $8.1 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchanges rates favorably impacted the translation of our results by $600,000. Our fourth quarter results translated at last year\u2019s exchange rates are what we term as constant currency basis would have produced net income of $10.9 million. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.77 in the fourth quarter compared to the $0.53 in the prior year quarter and diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.4 million shares to 14.9 million shares.", "For the full fiscal year, net income was $43.7 million versus $39.8 million in the prior year. Again changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact, this for the year, $700,000 of net income. On a constant currency basis, net income for the full fiscal year would have been $43 million. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.87 for the full fiscal year compared to the $2.54 in the prior fiscal year period and diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.6 million to 15.2 million shares.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at our balance sheet at August 31. Our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong as our cash and term deposits continue to exceed our debt. At the end of our fiscal year our cash balance was $57.8 million and we had $45 million in short-term investments which consist of term and time deposits held in Money Center Banks. During our fiscal year, we borrowed an additional $35 million under our revolving credit facility. The current portion of debt under that existing line was $98 million, up from the $63 million last year, leaving us with an additional $27 million available under the line at year end.", "We continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. Regarding the dividend, on October 3, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 a share, payable October 31 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 17, 2014. Based on today\u2019s closing price of $67.93 the annualized dividend yield would be 2%. As for our share repurchases we acquired 602,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $42.8 million. During the fiscal year, these shares were acquired under our current share buyback plan approved by the Board of Directors in June of 2013. It provides authorization to acquire up to $60 million of the company\u2019s outstanding shares through the plan\u2019s end date of August 31, 2015.", "Under the current plan, the company has repurchased 648,000 shares at a total cost of $45.4 million. In order for the company to continue repurchasing shares, our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback plan earlier this week that authorizes the company to acquire up to $75 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2016. The new plan will be effective once the current share repurchase plan is completed.", "In total, we delivered a return on invested capital of 28.2% in fiscal 2014. We are very proud of this industry leading statistic and we will continue to be focused and deliberate in the way we manage our business in order to generate maximum returns for our shareholders, while continuing to support the company\u2019s long-term term growth initiatives.", "Well, that completes the financial overview. More information will be available in our Form 10-K, which will be filed next Tuesday. Thanks so much and now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jay. This was a good year and we are pleased that we have been able to maintain growth across our business globally despite some bumps that were hit along the way. Most of you know that I prefer to look at this business over the long-term. I have often said that our performance in particular quarter, in any particular quarter is not as important as the long-term trends of our business. Through the focused and deliberate efforts of our hard working Tribe members, we made solid and steady progress in the last 10 years where we have been able to double our global sales in multi-purpose maintenance products. While we expect to see fluctuations in sales and in our financial results from time to time, we anticipate seeing continued growth driven by our strategic initiatives, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns to our shareholders.", "So with that let\u2019s turn to fiscal year 2015 guidance. The following fiscal year 2015 guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to recent levels. Full fiscal year 2015, we expect our net sales results to be in the range of $398 million to $413 million, a growth of between 4% and 8%. We project gross margins to be close to 52%. We expect our global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 6% to 7% of net sales. We expect net income of between $45.1 million and $46.4 million which would achieve a diluted EPS of between $3.07 and $3.16 assuming 14.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "So in summary, what did you hear from this call today. Well, you heard my croaky voice from a little bit of a cold, but the most important things you heard was we increased sales by 4% in both the fourth quarter and the full year. You heard the Specialist product line continues to perform well with a global growth rate year-over-year of 34%. You heard we acquired the GT85 brand. You heard that we continue to remain \u2013 maintain strong gross margins and in fact reported the highest annual gross margin in a decade of nearly 52% for the full year. You heard that we grew diluted earnings per share to $2.87, which is a record high for the company. You heard we delivered an industry leading return on invested capital of 28.2% in fiscal year 2014. You heard that we continued to return capital to our stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases and that our Board of Directors recently approved new \u2013 a new share repurchase plan. You heard that our outlook for fiscal year 2015 and beyond is optimistic.", "In closing, I would like to share a quote with you from Zig Ziglar, you don\u2019t build a business, you build people, and then the people build the business. Thank you for joining us today. We would be now pleased to open the conference call to your questions, back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities.", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities", "Thank you. Good afternoon Garry. Good afternoon Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Hey Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hi, Liam.", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities", "Garry, you \u2013 I think you quoted 34% increase in Specialist?", "Garry Ridge", "That\u2019s correct.", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities", "That\u2019s \u2013 is that heavily weighted towards the more mature or the more \u2013 the markets where you have been in at the longest like North America and is the trend working, are you satisfied with the trend in some of the newer markets?", "Garry Ridge", "Again, of course the growth continues to gain momentum particularly where we launched early. We are very comfortable and very happy with Specialist. It will be a long-term growth engine. We continue now to develop new categories and platforms. And it\u2019s not only benefiting our revenues, but it\u2019s also \u2013 of Specialist, but it\u2019s also helping us to further expand out MUP business or our blue and yellow can business, Liam. An example of that is through the development of WD-40 Specialist Motorbike in the United Kingdom, we gained 450 new distribution centers for our MUP product through the motorcycle industry. So, we are very pleased with the continued success of the Specialist strategy.", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities", "And same in Europe, you saw distribution increase or sales through the distribution or indirect channel increased 16%, have you been adding distributors or are you just seeing stronger end user demand, you mentioned Russia and Eastern Europe?", "Garry Ridge", "No, we are not adding distributors it\u2019s just further development of current markets. We, Russia, for example, I think we are pushing through the 12 million can mark there now. That\u2019s probably doubled in the past 5 to 6 years. And then as you may recall, Liam, a lot of these markets have a long runway yet to go. So, it\u2019s just more development of the markets that we are in.", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities", "Great. And Jay, I know that you have had to step up inventory to support the new distribution infrastructure you have had. Has that ramp up in inventory been completed and can we just expect it to run at this level now or numbers of turns however you want to measure it?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes. I mean, I think that we see the current inventory levels as generally sustainable. Although as we look forward, we do see some \u2013 a couple of events that would cause us to full inventory and a little bit above this level. As we look forward next year there are couple of activities that we are envisioning, dealing with, one is the conversion of our car product that would require us to increase some inventory. So \u2013 but, the current levels for the longer term sustained level are generally appropriate.", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities", "Great. Thank you, Garry. Thank you, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Liam.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Hi. I was wondering if you could just explain a little bit more about the disruption in Canada. I know that the recall is over with, but can you explain is it a matter of the retailers kind of being reluctant to take your product back or is it a technicality about getting a different product actually out there, physically like you are having\u2026.", "Garry Ridge", "That would be the second point, Linda. What we did is in the retail channel we pulled the Smart Straw product out. It\u2019s got to be \u2013 it\u2019s then replaced with the classic product. The selling price of the two is lower. So, we had a mix match of taking product back, refilling that pipeline, so that\u2019s basically the offset, but it\u2019s not a \u2013 there has been no negative reaction to the product overall.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "So, then it sounds like that\u2019s something that you can anticipate or project when you would have this smooth, so that things are back to normal. Was that soon, I mean, I think to recall this being an issue now for several quarters so?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. We will lap it in the fourth quarter. So, it\u2019s \u2013 well, there is a couple of things in Canada. We had a couple of events in Canada. One was we had the Smart Straw recall. The second was we had a downturn in one of the quarters, because Canada just had a horrible, horrible winter. So, that\u2019s behind us I hope. But we \u2013 as we said in the call, we would believe that we are going to see Canada back on a growth trajectory as we start to now move through the new fiscal year.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay, okay. And then I think to recall last quarter in the discussion on the call about actually promos in the U.S. business that would kind of kick in, that would return the whole Americas segment to growth in the August quarter. So, I was a little surprised to still see it down. I know that Canada is still an issue, but did that promo happen as you had talked about or am I remembering things incorrectly or what happened there?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, I can put a little more flavor on that. In the U.S. for the full year, year-over-year our multi-purpose maintenance products grew by 2.45% in actual revenue dollars. The quarters were a little flat up or little more regular this year than they were last year. So but overall our business grew 2.45% in the U.S. for our core business which is the multi-purpose maintenance products business. We grew 7.3% in Latin America, the Americas grew 1.7% in total. The difference was in the full year our business in Canada was off about 16%.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay. And then \u2013 and this little acquisition you did in the UK, can you \u2013 I know it\u2019s really small and your total sales in the UK I think are about $25 million if I am not mistaken, so even if this thing has $2 million of annual sales it\u2019s going to add 8% to your sales next year in the UK, so am I thinking of that correctly and how are the margins of this versus your margins of your existing products there?", "Garry Ridge", "The GT85 business is small and what we are doing with it is we will have some impact on overall revenue, but it\u2019s only small, but it does generate a reasonable level of EBITDA. We will however be investing that in our continued growth opportunities for both our bike and motorcycle business. So we will see a little revenue kick. We won\u2019t \u2013we will feel the full effect of the GT85 acquisition probably a year from now as it helps us build out our business in the total Bike segment. It\u2019s kind of like a Trojan Horse, if you will. It allowed us to ride into the category with a head start, a bit like we used 3-IN-ONE in Spain and France some 15, 16, 17 years ago to establish ourselves.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay. And then \u2013 and can I just switch to asking you about the outlook for you input cost, certainly we are seeing very low oil prices these days and your growth margin was very nice in the quarter, why would it be if your growth margin was 52.7% in the quarter, why would it not be actually higher like closer to 53% going forward as you realize the benefits of these lower petroleum based costs?", "Jay Rembolt", "Well, if we were able to realize the benefits of these petroleum \u2013 the lower costs over the full year, your analysis isn\u2019t too far off.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "So then your comment about gross margin being close to 52% is just a little on the conservative side for next year?", "Jay Rembolt", "While we have seen \u2013 we have seen we are not really sure if this is a complete trend or if this is an event, this recent reduction, dramatic reduction in the price of oil.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay, alright. And I guess just in terms of your little bit of an increase in your share repurchase from $60 million over two years to $75 million, is that just a function of your confidence in the business or is there something else behind it and do you still intend to add debt while cash builds up on the balance sheet, is that how it\u2019s going to go?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. Well, just to be clear we didn\u2019t take the $60 million to $75 million. The Board authorized the new $75 million on top of the $60 million. So once this $60 million is used which will be within the next quarter or so, we will then enter \u2013 we will then start into the new $75 million buyback program.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay. So its still \u2013 I thought both programs were over two years though am I my wrong..?", "Garry Ridge", "Well one \u2013 the first one was over two years, but if \u2013 they had a completion date of 2015. We have actually \u2013 we will actually complete that about 9 months early, because we are nearly through that $60 million now, so the new one has another two years to run basically at an increase level \u2013 at a new amount of $75 million. So over a three and a half year period, we would had a total authorization of $135 million which at this time we have used around 40 some million in the total $45 million. ", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay. Thanks, Linda.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we have a follow-up question from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Hi. I thought I would just follow up just to get all my questions answered, but going back to the input cost, I think that you normally review your can contracts about once a year. Is that coming up soon or have you just completed and what would be the outlook for your can cost?", "Garry Ridge", "January is when we have our annual can cycle pricing that takes place. We don\u2019t at the moment envision anything other than some level of current stability.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay. And then on the pricing side, I mean most of what we have seen lately is price increases to offset rising input cost, but now we are going into this lower oil price time period. Do you expect to realize price decreases on your products and if so how long would it take for that to flow through your income statement?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, we will be as deliberate in considering that as we are as deliberate as considering increases. So, at this time, we will do what we normally do, which is we will sit and see whether this current lowering of oil is an event or is it a longer term event or a trend, but we are not anticipating any price decreases.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay, great. And then just turning to the Asia region, I know that there had been this disruption from the distributor change.", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "I am assuming that\u2019s done and over with now. You did have pretty strong results in Asia in the quarter, so that\u2019s all completed?", "Garry Ridge", "That\u2019s done and we are lapping that. And we expect our Asian region to show reasonable growth in the upcoming year.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay. And then just one more question on A&P spending, your A&P ratio. I know that you say it will be in the 6% to 7% range, but if you really look at a trend, it\u2019s really been slightly declining in the last couple of years?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Is that due to efficiencies of spending or why is it declining?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, number one is a deliberate shift out of the household products, which have a much higher cost of promotion than our normal product range. And number two as we develop and launch our specialist product range, we are able to use the high level effect of the brand. We are not launching a new brand we are launching products under our brand. So, we are able to see, I think get better efficiency out of our marketing investments.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Right, I got it. Okay. And then on Specialist, I know you said it was up 34% in the year, but have you said how big it is just in terms of percentage of sales or absolute dollars or?", "Garry Ridge", "Not yet, but you will be one of the first to know when we do.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "So, are MP/MP product sales \u2013 were they up in the year, excluding Specialist?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley", "Okay. Okay, I guess that\u2019s all from me. Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay, Linda.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product, affectionately known as MUP. Our goal under this first initiative is to take WD-40 MUP to more places for more people with more uses.", "Although global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product were nearly flat in the first quarter of this year\u2019s compared to the first quarter of last year, we saw a growth of MUP sales in both of the Americas and Asia Pacific segments. In fact, we experienced double-digit growth in several markets within our Asia Pacific segment, primarily within our distributor markets in the Asian region.", "The sales growth of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product that we experienced in the Americas and Asia Pacific was entirely offset by a decline in EMEA, primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency and a decline in orders following a heavy promotional period in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year.", "I\u2019ll discuss this decline in EMEA in more detail when I review the results by segment. Finally, we look forward to sharing with you in the near future new initiatives we\u2019ve planned for the WD-40 Multi Product -- Multi-Use Product line later in the year.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories within defined geographies and platforms. The WD-40 Specialist product line continued to support the WD-40 brand with a global growth rate of 28% in the first quarter compared to the prior year first quarter. Each market, country and segment experiences different short-term trends relating to the sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line. We continue to believe that WD-40 Specialist should be a substantial revenue and earnings growth engine for many years to come.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within the -- of our Company to derive revenue from new sources outside of our flagship WD-40 brand. In fiscal year 2014, we launched some exciting new products under the multipurpose maintenance products umbrella, which included a complete refresh of the three in one offering in the U.S and we expect these new products will start to contribute to our sales growth in fiscal 2015. We also have completed the acquisition of the GT85 brand in September 2014 and we started to generate sales from this new brand during the first quarter of this fiscal year.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop, and retain outstanding Tribe members. In attracting we welcome 26 new Tribe members during the first quarter. As Zig Ziglar once said, you don\u2019t feel the Company, you feel people and then the people build the business. Building our Company\u2019s bench strength for our future success is a top priority. To support this initiative in fiscal year 2015, we have launched another year of our leadership laboratory program, a program which has been created to provide comprehensive training to develop all levels of Tribe members who -- in the interest of their own professional development.", "As far as retain is concerned, we\u2019re excited to learn in this quarter that recently our U.S profit sharing on 401(k) retirement plan received the highest rating in its peer group by BrightScope, a leading independent provider of retirement plan ratings and investment analytics.", "Our strategic initiative number five looks at operational excellence. This initiative includes the continuous improvement of optimizing resources, systems and processes in order to help offset rising costs and protect our operating margin. Operational excellence is important to meet the ever increasing customer and regulatory requirements and the efficiency of managing our time, talent and treasure.", "We have several initiatives planned for fiscal 2015, which include marketing enhancements -- sorry, making enhancements to our supply chain in both the Americas and EMEA, transitioning all 50 states to the lower VOC formula we launched in California in fiscal year 2014, focusing on category management and continuing the implementation and upgrade of our ERP system in EMEA. We look forward to providing you with updates on these initiatives throughout the fiscal year. That completes the update on our strategic initiatives.", "So let\u2019s move on to the details of our first quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales grew to $96.4 million, which is a growth of approximately 1% in the first quarter versus the comparable period last year. Although the sales growth is lower than our targeted growth rate for fiscal 2015, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned for substantial growth and sustainable growth of our multi-purpose maintenance products over the longer term and are maintaining our fiscal year 2015 sales growth guidance of between 4% and 8%.", "If we take a closer look at sales by product group, sales of our multi-purpose maintenance products were $84.9 million in the first quarter, up approximately one percentage point versus last year. And as a reminder, products under this category include WD-40 Multi-Use Product, WD-40 Specialist and the 3-IN-ONE brand, WD-40 Bike as well as our newest member of the WD-40 brand family GT85. As you know we focus our time, talent, and treasure on this area of our business which accounted for 88% of our global sales in the first quarter.", "By trading block, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products in the first quarter were up 3% in the Americas, down 5% in EMEA and up 14% in Asia-Pacific. I will discuss the drivers of some of these changes in a few moments.", "Sales of our homecare and cleaning products were $11.5 million in the first quarter, down about 1% from last year. The category accounted for 12% of our net sales in Q1. As a reminder, the homecare and cleaning products include the brands of Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, No Vac, 1001, X-14, Lava and Solvol brands. By trading block, sales of our homecare and cleaning products were down 3% in the Americas, down 6% in EMEA and up 13% in Asia-Pacific.", "As a reminder, our homecare and cleaning products, particularly, those in the U.S. are considered harvest brands that continue to generate positive cash flows, but are becoming a smaller part of the business as net sales of the multi-purpose maintenance products grow with the execution of our strategic initiatives.", "Now onto our results by segment. Let\u2019s start firstly with the Americas. Net sales in the Americas which includes the United States, Canada, and Latin America increased to $44.8 million in the first quarter, up 2% versus last year. The segment amounted -- accounted for 46% of global sales in both the current and prior year.", "Sales of multi-purpose maintenance products increased nearly 3% in the Americas, but that increase was partially offset by a nearly 3% decrease in the sales of our homecare and cleaning products. The increase in sales in multi-purpose maintenance products was mainly driven by higher sales of WD-40 Multi-Purpose maintenance products in Latin America, which were up 19%. This growth is attributed to the continued growth of WD-40 MUP through the Latin American region including in Mexico, Brazil and Peru. This increase in sales was partially offset by a 13% decrease in sales in Canada, primarily due to the change in distribution as well as the timing of some customer specific promotions. In the United States, sales of multi-purpose maintenance products remain relatively flat quarter-to-quarter.", "Now on to our EMEA segment, net sales in the EMEA segment which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India decreased to $34.6 million in the first quarter, down 5% versus last year. The segment accounted for 36% of global sales compared to 38% in the first quarter of last year. Sales of multi-purpose maintenance products decreased by approximately 5% and sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased by approximately 6%. Because our results can fluctuate due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates, we also show our results in what we call constant currency. For that we translate the current period results from our foreign subsidiaries' functional currencies into U.S dollars at the prior period exchange rate. The functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary is the pound sterling.", "On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA segment would have decreased to $33.8 million in the first quarter, down 7% versus last year. In addition to the impact of foreign currency changes when translating functional currency results in U.S dollars, EMEA results in pound sterling have also affected by foreign currency exchange rates due to the fact that a significant portion of these sales denominated in euros and U.S dollars. As a result, pound sterling sales are also negatively or positively impacted by the weakening or strengthening of the euro and the U.S dollar against the pound sterling.", "In the first quarter the euro and the U.S dollar declined against the pound sterling by 8% and 3% respectively as compared to the first quarter of last fiscal year, reducing EMEA sales by approximately 3% from period-to-period. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as throughout exclusive marketing distributors. In direct markets which account for 56% of sales in EMEA, net sales declined 7% primarily due to the decline in the euro and the low level of customer orders following a heavy promotional period in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.", "Other direct markets, which generate a significant portion of their sales in euros were down by approximately 5% in pound sterling during the -- due to the weakening of the euro. In the distributor markets, which account for 44% of EMEA net sales declined 4% primarily due to the decline in the U.S dollar and slower sales in the Middle East and Eastern European markets primarily due to the political unrest in the regions. The distributor markets which generate a significant portion of the sales in the U.S dollars were down by approximately 2% in pound sterling due to the weakening of the U.S dollar. Lot of exchange rates there.", "Now on to the Asia Pacific segment. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific segment which includes Australia, China, and other countries in the Asian region, increased to $17 million in the first quarter, up 14% versus last year. The segment accounted for 18% of global sales compared to 16% in the first quarter of last year. Sales of multi-purpose maintenance products increased 14% and sales of homecare and cleaning products increased 13%.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales for Asia Pacific segment from period-to-period. Net sales in Australia remained relatively constant from the first quarter of this year as compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rate had a negative impact on the sales results in Australia. In Australian dollars sales increased 3% over the period last year, primarily due to increased promotional activities.", "Sales in China decreased 14% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the timing of promotional programs. The promotional program that we ran in the first quarter of last year started and ended during the quarter. Whereas the one that we\u2019ve run in the first quarter of this year started mid quarter and will end or did end in mid December. We continue to focus on the long-term opportunities in China, but they will continue to be a lot of volatility on the way as due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "Sales in the rest of the Asian region increased 36% in the first quarter as compared to last year and more than made up for the sales declines we saw in China. These increases were driven by improved sales of their multi-purpose products through most of our distributor markets including those in South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines.", "That\u2019s it for the sales update. I will take a break now and turn over to Jay, who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. In addition to the information that we are presenting in this call today, we suggest that you review our Form 10-Q for the quarter, which we will file tomorrow.", "First, a quick review of our 50/30/20 rule, that\u2019s the measures that we use to guide our business. And as you may recall, 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is at or below 30% of net sales. And finally the 20 represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is above 50% and our cost of business is 30% or less, our EBITDA will be above 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. And the descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q and in our investor presentation which is available on the Investor Relations Web site.", "Now a look at the 50 or our gross margin in the 50/30/20 rule. Gross margin in the first quarter was 51.6% compared to 52% in the prior fiscal year period. The slight decrease in gross margin was driven by the impacts from foreign currency exchange rates in EMEA, and costs associated with increased promotional activities in the Asia Pacific and the Americas regions. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by decrease in input costs along with price increases. Though we cannot control the impacts of foreign currency on our results, we continue to be focused and deliberate in managing the rest of our business for maximum growth in our gross margin.", "We experienced a net favorable impact of 80 basis points from our major input costs. This was driven by changes in the cost of petroleum-based special chemicals and aerosol cans, primarily in our EMEA segment. In addition, our gross margin improved by 30 basis points as a result of increases implemented -- price increases implemented over the past 12 months in parts of EMEA and parts of Asia Pacific.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates within our EMEA segment negatively impact the gross margin by 60 basis points. In EMEA, our cost of goods are sourced almost entirely in pound/sterling, while revenues are generated in euros, pound/sterling and the U.S. dollars. The value of the euro and the U.S. dollar both deteriorated versus the pound/sterling in the first quarter of this year as compared to the first quarter of last year. This caused revenues sourced in those currencies to be worth less in pound/sterling, thus resulting in the decrease to gross margin.", "Also impacting gross margin this quarter were higher promotional discounts which had an unfavorable impact on our gross margin of 50 basis points. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentives, trade promotions and cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction in sales. The timing and magnitude of these activities cause fluctuations in gross margin period-to-period. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 40 basis points due to sales mix changes as well as other miscellaneous costs, which had a slight increase from the prior first quarter of last year.", "Now on to the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the first quarter, our cost of doing business was 34%. This is a slight increase from the 33% for the first quarter last year. While our goal is to have our cost of doing business to be at or below 30% of net sales, we plan to continue our investments in new product development, brand protection, as well as regulatory and quality assurance. As a result, we expect our cost of doing business to remain near current levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2015.", "We expect to move closer to our target of 30% over time as our revenues grow. Year-to-date, 76% of the total cost of doing business came from three areas: people costs or the investments that we make in our Tribe; our investments in marketing, advertising and promotional activities; and freight, the costs to get our products to our customers.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures was approximately 18% of net sales in the first quarter, a decline from the 19% in the prior fiscal year period. We target our EBITDA to be above 20% of net sales, but expect variations from time-to-time as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities.", "Well that completes our 50/30/20 discussion. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at one topic we know is on many investors\u2019 minds, the declining price of a barrel of crude oil. Crude oil is at a five-year low, however, modeling the impact of the price of crude oil on our business is very complex. So historically we\u2019ve looked at oil within a range. Over the last four years, oil has held very closely to the range of $85 to $110 a barrel. As long as the price of crude stays within this range there is general stability in our margin. As it moves out of this range we see the potential for volatility.", "It is important to clarify that though petroleum based specialty chemicals make up a significant portion, approximately 40% of the input costs associated with the can of our WD-40 Multi-Use Product, only a small amount of the cost is directly indexed to the cost of crude oil. This is because we do not buy crude oil; instead we buy custom formulated specialty chemicals which have their own complex cost drivers, including the manufacturing region of production costs and distinctive supply and demand characteristics. So though falling crude oil prices will most likely be a net positive for our gross margin as it is extremely difficult to know the long-term impact of such changes until we actually see it in our cost of goods which will take time. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as we learn more.", "Now let\u2019s move back to our first quarter results. Here are some details on our SG&A expenses. In the first quarter, SG&A expense increased by 3% to $27.4 million compared to the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 28.5% in the first quarter compared to 27.9% in the prior year period. The increase in SG&A expense was driven by higher employee related costs, a higher level of travel and meeting expenses, and the impact of changes from foreign currency exchange rates.", "Employee related expenses increased $300,000 compared to the prior year. These increases were primarily due to an increased employee base as well as annual merit increases. Also contributing to the increase in SG&A was travel and meeting expenses in support of our strategic initiatives which increased $200,000 when compared to last year. Finally changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact period versus period increasing SG&A expenses by about $200,000.", "In the first quarter we continued to invest in research and new product development and invested $1.6 million in R&D up from the $1.4 million last year. The majority of this investment is associated with our multi-purpose maintenance products as we believe that by continuing to focus on innovation and renovation we strengthen our foundation for the future.", "Advertising, sales and promotional expenses increased by 5% in the first quarter to $5.9 million. And as a percentage of sales, A&P investment was 6.1% in the first quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The increase primarily associated with a higher level of promotional activities in both EMEA and the Asia Pacific. Increases were slightly offset by a little bit lower promotional program activities in the Americas. As a reminder, it is common for sales and advertising -- sales promotion advertising expenses to fluctuate period-to-period based on the type of marketing activity or promotion that we employ within any given period.", "Amortization of our intangible assets increased by a total of $200,000 to $800,000 in the first quarter of this year. This increase was primarily due to customer list that we acquired from our Belgium marketing distributor in the second quarter of 2014, as well as the GT85 acquisition which we completed in September. Total operating expenses in the current quarter were $34.1 million versus $32.9 million last year. Our operating income in the first quarter was $15.6 million compared to the $16.8 million in the prior year period. Other expenses net which includes interest income, interest expense, and other miscellaneous income and expense in total decreased by $240,000 in the first quarter, the decrease was primarily due to the fluctuations in exchange rates.", "In the first quarter of this year we recorded foreign currency exchange gains whereas we recorded losses in the prior year quarter. The provision for income taxes in Q1 was 30.6% versus 30.3% in the prior fiscal year quarter. The higher tax rate is primarily due to the timing of benefits associated with State Tax Filings. Net income in the first quarter was $10.8 million versus $11.5 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on the translation of our consolidated results. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 in the first quarter compared to the $0.74 in the prior year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased from 15.4 million shares to 14.7 million shares.", "Now look at our balance sheet at November 30. Our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain strong. At the end of our first quarter, our cash balance was $46.4 million and we had $42.6 million in short-term investments which consist of term and time deposits held in Money Center Banks. During the quarter there were no additional borrowings against our revolving line of credit, and as a result our debt remained at $98 million at the end of the first quarter.", "We continue to return capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases, and on December 9, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share which reflects an increase of 12% over the previous quarter\u2019s dividend of $0.34 a share. And based on today\u2019s closing price of $85.48, the annualized dividend yield would be 1.8%.", "As for share repurchases, we acquired 144,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $9.9 million during the quarter. These shares were acquired under our current share buyback plan. We currently have two share buyback plans that have been approved by our Board of Directors and are in place through August 31, of 2016. Between the two approved plans, the company can acquire an additional $80 million of its outstanding shares.", "Well that completes the financial review, and again more information will be on our 10-Q which we\u2019ll file tomorrow. And I\u2019ll turn this now back over to, Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Great. Thank you, Jay. Most of you have heard me say many times that I look at our business over the longer term, and that performance in a particular quarter isn\u2019t not as important as the long-term trend of our business. Our progress in this quarter should be viewed with this perspective. Our global business and our results are subject to ebbs and flows of many things including changing foreign currency exchange rates, political un-risks, from the changes in input costs just to name a few. However well we expect to see fluctuations in our sales and in our financial results in particular quarters, we anticipate seeing continued growth driven by our strategic initiatives which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver strong returns to our stockholders over the longer period. Therefore, our fiscal year 2015 guidance is as follows. This guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestiture activity. We expect our global fiscal year sales to be in the range of $398 million to $430 million, and that\u2019s a growth of between 4% and 8%.", "We project our gross margin to be better than 52%, that\u2019s a slight upward revision from our last quarter guidance. We expect our global advertising promotion investment to be in the range of 6% and to 7%. We expect net income between $45.1 million and $46.4 million which would achieve a diluted EPS of between $3.07 and $3.16, assuming 14.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "We are comfortable with our current guidance range for net income, but there are global market dynamics going on outside the company\u2019s control that may have offsetting effects which could impact specific elements of our guidance. These include the recent decline in the price of crude oil and the present trends in foreign currency exchange rates. Falling crude prices are certainly a net positive for our gross margin, but it will take time to fully understand the impact that recent declines in the price of crude oil will have on our financials.", "Conversely, if recent trends in foreign currency exchange rates continue particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar our consolidated results would be adversely impacted. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and look forward to updating investors on any impact that these external factors might have on our guidance in the future.", "In summary, what did you hear from us on the call today? You heard we experienced slow but steady growth of our multi-purpose maintenance products. You heard that our WD-40 specialist product line continues to perform well with global growth rate of 28% quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year in the quarter. You heard that we increased that divided by 12%. You heard that we\u2019ve identified some volatility around specific elements that impact our financial performance including the recent decline in the price of crude oil and the recent trends in foreign currency exchange rates, and you heard that our long-term outlook remains optimistic and we believe we are and off to a good start in 2015 and we see a solid steady year ahead as we continue to put our efforts behind our strategic initiatives.", "In closing, as I do, I would like to share a quote with you this time from Winston Churchill. It\u2019s always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you can see.", "Thank you for joining us today. We would be pleased to now open the call for -- the conference for any calls, and I would turn it back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities.", "Liam Burke", "Good afternoon, Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, part of the cost of doing business is, you talked about additional investments in brand protection and new product development. That\u2019s right off the slide. In terms of new product development, which way you\u2019re looking? Are you looking to develop another vertical like BIKE or something to leverage of the WD-40 brand?", "Garry Ridge", "Currently the majority of the -- well, let me put it -- divide it. There is longer term development which would include new specialist areas, but we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work around WD-40 MUP. And as I mentioned in the call earlier, we\u2019ll be sharing later on in the year a -- what we consider to be a new and an exciting development under the blue and yellow can. On top of that we\u2019re also working on extensions of the specialist product line particularly in categories that we identified have some longer term growth opportunities.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. You mentioned BIKE and that looks to be another developed product line here. You made the acquisition of the GT85. How is that progressing vis-\u00e0-vis your expectations?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019re very encouraged with the initial launch in Europe with WD-40 BIKE. We are now selling our BIKE products in all three trading blocks, and that currently now during this slow season, this winter season in the northern hemisphere building distribution out for the summer season that will come. So, we\u2019re in the BIKE business. We see it as being a meaningful and developing business over time, and we\u2019re integrating GT85 into our network. So overall, I think we feel comfortable at the positioning of BIKE and we\u2019ll look forward to continuing to build it to a meaningful part of our revenue, but it will take time.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Thank you, Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Liam.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Hi. Happy New Year to you guys.", "Garry Ridge", "Happy New Year, Linda.", "Jay Rembolt", "Happy New Year as well.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Could I just ask you to clarify on the currency impact elements? When you were talking about the EMEA region, can you just clarify once again the total FX impact on the sales in the EMEA region for the quarter, in millions of dollars?", "Jay Rembolt", "Are you looking at the percent changes?", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Well, either give it to me in dollar, what sales would have been in local currency versus in dollars or give me a percentage impact, yes.", "Jay Rembolt", "Let me just take a quick look at this Linda. So we\u2019ve got -- again the challenge in EMEA is that we have a currency impact on translation that is taking the sterling results and translating them back into U.S. dollars and that would have changed. So for example we ended up -- our current results were $34.6 million and had we not had the changes in currencies on translation we would have been at $33.8 million. Now again as Garry said, we also have changes in the sterling results that occur as the sterling changes against both the dollar and the euro and that had a -- in period to period, there was effectively an 8% change in the euro over that period and about 3% change in the dollar.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. So, I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at, as an analyst I\u2019m trying to project for the year what that currency impact on your sales will be for the full year? And I guess I had been modeling maybe negative 1% to 1.5%, is that at the ballpark range? Or can you help us out with that in any way?", "Jay Rembolt", "Well, if rates stay at the current levels it would be more than that.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. Can you give some rough idea given where rates are now?", "Jay Rembolt", "We haven\u2019t provided an outlook that basically locks in current rates throughout the remainder of the year. We haven\u2019t provided that.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "All right. And then did the small acquisition even though it was very small in the UK, did it make any favorable effect on sales growth in the EMEA regions?", "Jay Rembolt", "It was only small Linda, a few hundred thousand, that\u2019s all.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay.", "Jay Rembolt", "We\u2019re still very much in integration mode of that. We haven\u2019t started to expand its distribution yet. We have to tuck it into our system, and we would expect to start to ramp up that activity after February.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay, all right. And then, it seems that one of the difficulties a little bit with projecting everything for you guys quarter-by-quarter is just the timing of your promotions, and I know you\u2019ve always cautioned that. So, if this was a -- I guess, I\u2019d say with heavier promotion last quarter especially in EMEA you mentioned and that was lighter now. Is there any way to project, I mean you\u2019re sort of in the midst of your next quarter. Is the next quarter going to be normal or is there any sort of shift that you can tell us about ahead of time to help us out?", "Garry Ridge", "We would expect that -- we would expect EMEA in the second quarter to show growth. We have a lot of activity. We would expect quarters two and three to be particularly active this year given what we know in EMEA given some launch of some new products that we have got planned. So, to be honest with you, Q1 was not a disappointment to us, but we haven\u2019t got quarteritis and we don\u2019t get quarteritis. So the things -- the two things that are confusing us at the moment is the impact of oil in foreign currencies. The underlying trading in the business, we have a very good handle on it Linda and feel really good.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay, all right. So, just the oil issue of course we\u2019re all watching these, these low oil prices. I actually try, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m looking at the right exact thing, but I try to monitor from Bloomberg a commodity that it might be similar to what you actually use and it looks like that\u2019s down also, not down quite as much as oil, but it is starting to really be down quite a bit double digit year-over-year. So, is it just a matter of the lag before if the inventory that you have rolled off and it flows into you income statement. Is that kind of the timing lag that you referred to?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, two things. Firstly, if you think about the quarter we\u2019ve just been in, although we\u2019re talking about it. Oil prices started the quarter at $95 and ended the quarter around $80. So well really we\u2019re looking at a quarter that was very similar to all the quarters we\u2019ve had in the past, and in fact if you look at the last two quarters, if we started at a $100 and end it up at about $80. So finally and up it was right within our band and we had movement within the quarter. Then you saw oil drop from about mid October to now. So, again we are now watching the impacts of that, and its going to take time for A; the inventory that we have in the system to move through this make; the new inventory to come into the system and get into this make and then move through this make. And on the input, in the input cost not all of them, and as Jay shared there\u2019s only a portion of them that react closely to oil, the others react at different times because they\u2019re processed and manufactured. So, this is an interesting time for us. We have never really reflected at it going down like this. We know that whenever prices go up we feel them sooner and harder. And now we\u2019re saying, where is the reduction for the price coming down? There is no doubt in our mind that lower oil prices are a good thing for gross margin going forward. We\u2019re still working out how much, how long and that\u2019s why we revised our guidance to say instead of close to greater than or better than the $52 that we have now. We hope to learn more on the way it flows into our business in the next 60 to 90 days.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right. I understand totally. So, can you give us a feel Garry for how you think about, if you do -- if oil does stay down and you just start to experience these benefits; how do you think about like reinvesting some back into your growth initiatives in the company? Would you tend to do that? Or can you just think of like how you think about that in your business?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, I think the thing that we do think about is our end users a lot. And if oil stays at a low number for a long period of time and we don\u2019t know that yet, because if I go back to 2008 and 2009, it was down around these numbers all over then but it bounced back again. But the thing we don\u2019t want to do is we don\u2019t want to unnaturally impact regular pricing because it just whiplashes the whole business. What we may do is increase the value proposition to our end users by running different or new promotions that would might get us new distribution, we really want to make sure that we continue to grow and to have a strong gross margin, but we also want to recognize the fact that we want to continue to deliver great value to our customers, into our end users. So we\u2019ll be watching that closely. It\u2019s a topic of constant conversation in the company right now because we don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ll decide going forward.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Great. That sounds good. And then just finally, I know you had tested this Lawn & Garden line I think in Australia. Do you have any further information on that? I mean could we see a launch more broadly come this spring?", "Garry Ridge", "We\u2019re still waiting, its still summer time in Australia. They are not suffering the cold that we in some parts of the U.S. are as you know. And when we get that back we\u2019ll let it know, we may -- but we also have other things. We\u2019ve got some great new product development i.e. products or a product in the line under our MUP blue and yellow can that we will be bringing to market later in the year that we think is very exciting, that probably will have a greater impact on the U.S. market in a Lawn & Garden launch. But Lawn & Garden is certainly on the table and if it works we\u2019ll be bringing it to the market.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Linda.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Ben Richardson", "Hi. This is Ben Richardson stepping in for, Jeff.", "Garry Ridge", "Hello, Ben.", "Ben Richardson", "How are you, Garry?", "Garry Ridge", "Good.", "Ben Richardson", "So just wanted to say quickly, it\u2019s touching on raw materials again, but just the timing of some of your negotiations and the duration of contracts you might have on steel cans or plastics or any of this. Is there anything that\u2019s to be negotiated sooner or later and how long might these contracts be for these materials?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, typically the one that\u2019s longest term is our can pricing. And that\u2019s typically been an annual contract. We\u2019ve had discussions and have -- we\u2019re in that timeframe of renewal. We don\u2019t see a negative impact from this year. And we will update you once they\u2019re concluded. ", "Ben Richardson", "Okay. And just for -- from previous drops in crude that we\u2019ve seen fourth quarter 2008, fourth quarter of 2010, I look and it\u2019s a multi quarter response in your gross margin. Would you expect it to be any faster or any slower, given the magnitude of the decline in crude, just on the gross margin end?", "Garry Ridge", "I mean we think it will take some time to fully embed as we said earlier that there are -- oil is at the foundation of a number of these costs, but the speed with which any price in the underlying gets translated into our -- the finished goods that we buy that become our input costs can take time and we\u2019ve typically seen that delay on the downside much longer than on the upside.", "Ben Richardson", "Sure.", "Garry Ridge", "But I would expect that it would lay out over a couple of quarters as we say.", "Ben Richardson", "Okay. And then on the European weakness, I know some of its clearly currency, but what\u2019s going on fundamentally in any of those channels that -- can you identify any specific regions or what might be the source of \u2026?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, over the whole of Europe, we had a quarter that was impacted a little bit by some political unrest in the Ukraine, but it was insignificant in the big scheme of things. I think it was what I would call a sit down quarter. You can\u2019t dance at the party all night. You have to sit down a little while and let the market absorb what\u2019s in there. So I think it\u2019s long-term. For the year, we see Europe as a growth market. We\u2019ve got some major wins in the bag coming in the second and third quarter. The key markets like Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. look well. We\u2019ve seen stabilization in Russia now. We didn\u2019t -- we felt we may have got a little worst decline or even a little worse activity in Russia that didn\u2019t come. In fact, our can sales, I believe are up in Russia. So I think its just a quarter where we didn\u2019t have as much activity and -- but we think that two and three will be fine.", "Ben Richardson", "Okay, all right. Well, thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks very much, Ben.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of -- a follow-up question from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Hi. Is there any way that you can quantify roughly how much the heavy promotional in EMEA in the last quarter, in the fourth quarter? How much that shifted from the first quarter into that -- into the fourth quarter of 2014?", "Garry Ridge", "Linda, it doesn\u2019t shift, it just happened.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. So you wouldn\u2019t regard it as taking away -- I thought the way you worded it was took away from some of the sales in this quarter, no?", "Garry Ridge", "No, no it\u2019s just that we had a heavier fourth quarter promotional quarter. The year -- its going to be a growth year. So as I just said to Ben, excuse the way I describe it, but you can\u2019t dance at a party all night. Sometimes you situation down rest and I think in Europe they had a little sit down in the first quarter and the party will start in the second quarter again.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. I look forward to the party.", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, and you know that a majority of our product is sold on impulse and it\u2019s driven by display. So you have to sell in, let us go through the system and then sell out and sell in again. So majority of our volume doesn\u2019t come off that shelf. It comes off what we call the playground which is driven by multiple location displays driven by promotional events and activities and you just -- and we don\u2019t -- Linda, we don\u2019t mix very well with Barbie dolls and barbecue sets. Christmas time is not a high -- the traffic aisles and the promotional aisles in stores are filled with gift items. So its not unnatural for us in that Christmas quarter, not to have as many promotions as we normally have.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Linda.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the presentation to -- presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge; and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt. Following their prepared remarks, the operator will come back on the line for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that supporting materials for this call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.wd40company.com.

The Company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Wendy. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of $97.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, which is a 3% increase from the second quarter of last fiscal year. Year-to-date, net sales were $193.7 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year period.", "Net income for the second quarter was $11.3 million, compared to $10.3 million in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net income was $22.1 million, compared to $21.8 million in the prior year period.", "Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.76, compared to $0.67 last year. Year-to-date, diluted earnings per share were up $1.49, compared to $1.41 last year.", "Before I talk in more detail about our sales results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to update you on our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our goal under this initiative is to take WD-40 Multi-Use Product to more places for more people with more uses.", "Global sales of Multi-Use Product were up nearly 3% in the second quarter and up 1% year-to-date. The growth came from our Asia-Pacific segment, primarily within our Asia distributor markets in China, which was slightly offset by declines in the Americas and EMEA. I will discuss these fluctuations in more detail when I\u2019ll review the results by segment.", "Today, I\u2019d also like to share with you an exciting new innovation for the WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Later, this fiscal year, we expect to launch a new delivery system target at the high volume users of WD-40 Multi-Use Product, which we believe will make the product even easier to use in workshops and factories.", "The new delivery system will launch in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and we are looking forward to updating you on the progress of this innovation in the future.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories within defined geographic regions -- geographies and platforms. The WD-40 Specialist product line continues to grow and sales of the product line increased 8% in the second quarter and 17% year-to-date.", "We continue to launch new Specialist categories in markets around the world. Although, each market, country and segment experiences different short-term trends relating to the sales of the WD-40 Specialist. We continue to believe that WD-40 Specialist will be a substantial revenue and earnings growth engine for many years to come.", "Strategic initiative number three to broaden our revenue and product base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within the Company to derive revenue from new sources outside our flagship WD-40 brand.", "In the second quarter, we launched a new 3-IN-ONE Lock Lube in the Americas region and we saw solid sales of our net GT85 brand in the U.K. In addition, our initial launch of WD-40 BIKE in Europe is off to a great start. We see a lot of future opportunities with these incremental MPMP products and we look forward to updating you in the future on their progress.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding Tribe members. We welcomed 11 new Tribe members during the second quarter bringing our total to 37 for this fiscal year-to-date.", "Building our Company\u2019s bench strength for our future success is a top priority. To support this initiative, we commenced our fourth year of leadership lab in February, a program which has been created to provide comprehensive training to develop all levels of Tribe members who are interested in professional development.", "Retaining our Tribe members is important to us as well. The skills and experience our Tribe members have will help us succeed with our strategic initiatives. In the U.S. our employee tenure is more than double the U.S. national average.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. This initiative includes continuous improvement of resources, systems and processes in order to help offset rising costs and protect our operating margin.", "Operational excellence is important to meet our ever increasing customer and regulatory requirements, and to efficiently manage our time, talent and treasure. We continue to make progress on the initiatives planned for fiscal year 2015.", "We have made great strides in the area of category management. Category management is a retailing and purchasing concept in which the range of products sold by our trailer is broken down into discrete groups by related products. By partnering with our customers and implementing a category management strategy, we\u2019ve felt that customers maximize their ROI and to really win at the show.", "In addition to this work, we continue to move forward with the transitioning of all states to the U.S. into a lower VOC formula we launched in California in fiscal 2014. We expect to have this transition completed by the end of the current fiscal year. We look forward to providing you updates on these initiatives throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.", "That completes the broad update on our strategic initiatives. So let\u2019s move onto the details of our second quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales grew to $93.7 million in the second quarter and $193.7 million year-to-date. These numbers reflect growth of 2% -- of 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date comparing to the prior year periods.", "Although our underlying business is solid, we are currently experiencing some foreign currency exchange headwinds. Foreign currency exchange impact is a reality that every international business must navigate. Our business has both foreign currency transaction and translation exposure. While we can\u2019t avoid the impacts of these foreign currency exchange exposures, we would like to provide a little more detail on how these exposures can affect our results.", "We currently have four subsidiaries located outside of the United States that generate sales and do businesses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. They are located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and China. The main currency with each of our subsidiaries conduct its business is called the functional currency.", "We have a foreign currency translation exposure when we translate the results of our foreign subsidiaries from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar deflates the net sales denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar and thus has a negative effect on our consolidated results.", "In addition to this translation exposure, our U.K. subsidiary also experiences foreign currency transaction exposure because it conducts business in currencies other than its functional currency the pound sterling. A significant portion of EMEA\u2019s net sales are generated outside of the U.K. and are transacted in euros and U.S. dollars.", "When these sales are converted into pound sterling, EMEA\u2019s reported results can be impacted by the weakening or strengthening of these transaction currencies. In the second quarter, the average exchange rate for the euro against the pound sterling declined 7% whereas the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling increased by 6% when compared to the same period last year.", "So keeping the present currency environment in mind, I will now discuss our sales results in greater detail. If we take a closer look at our net sales by product group, we continue to be well positioned for sustainable growth of our multipurpose maintenance products. As a reminder, the products on this group include WD-40 Multi-Use Product a blue and yellow can, WD-40 specialist, 3-IN-ONE, WD-40 Bike and GT85.", "We frequently refer to this group as MPMP. We focus our time, talent and treasure on this product group as it accounted for 89% of our global sales in the second quarter. Consolidated MPMP sales were $86.6 million in the second quarter and $171.5 million year-to-date, up 3% and 2% respectively.", "By trade block, MPMP sales in the second quarter were down 1% in the Americas, up 1% in EMEA and up 32% in Asia-Pacific. Year-to-date, MPMP sales were up 1% in the Americas, down 2% in EMEA and up 21% in Asia-Pacific.", "If we take a closer look at the current product sales, the decrease in MPMP sales in the Americas was driven primarily by lower sales in Latin America and United States due to the timing of promotional activities.", "Although, the increase in MPMP sales in EMEA during the second quarter was only 1%, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates masked a much bigger and higher organic growth rate in this trade block period from period to period.", "The significant increase in MPMP sales in Asia-Pacific was primarily due to increased sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product throughout our Asian distributor markets and in China.", "Turning to the homecare and cleaning products group. Sales were $10.7 million in the second quarter and $22.2 million year-to-date, up 3% and 1% respectively. The group accounted for 11% of net sales in the second quarter. Our homecare and cleaning products include the brands Spot Shot, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh, no-vac, 1001, X-14, Lava and the Solvol brands.", "By trading block, sales of our home care and cleaning products in the second quarter were flat in the Americas, up 8% in EMEA and up 11% in Asia-Pacific. Sales year-to-date were down 1% in the Americas, up 1% in EMEA and up 12% in Asia-Pacific.", "As a reminder, our homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S. are considered harvest brands that continued to generate positive cash flows, but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business as net sales of our multi-purpose maintenance products grow with the execution of our strategic initiatives.", "Now onto our results by segment and let\u2019s start with the Americas. Net sales in the Americas, which include United States, Canada and Latin America, decreased to $44.7 million in the second quarter, down 1% versus last year. Year-to-date net sales in the Americas increased slightly to $89.5 million as compared to $89.3 million last year.", "In the second quarter, the segment accounted for 46% of global sales versus 48% in the prior year period. Total U.S. sales were down 1% in both the second quarter and year-to-date.", "The decrease in sales in the U.S. was driven primarily by lower sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product due to the timing of promotional activities. However, in the U.S., we experienced double-digit growth of the WD-40 Specialist product line in both the second quarter and year-to-date.", "Sales in Canada were down 1% in the second quarter and down 7% year-to-date. The decrease was driven primarily by lower sales of homecare and cleaning products in both the second quarter and year-to-date.", "Total Latin American sales were down 6% in the second quarter, but were up 7% year-to-date. The decrease in sales in the second quarter was driven primarily by lower sales of multi-purpose maintenance products due to the timing of promotional activities. Year-to-date, the increase in sales was mainly driven by higher sales of WD-40 multi-purpose maintenance products throughout the region including Mexico and Chile.", "Now onto our EMEA segment. Net sales in the EMEA segment, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, increased to $38.7 million in the second quarter, up 1% versus last year. Year-to-date sales decreased 2% to $73.7 million in the second quarter. The segment accounted for 40% of global sales, which is flat compared to last year.", "As we discussed in detail earlier, our results fluctuate due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates. Therefore, we also discuss our sales in what we call constant currency. For that, we translate the current period results from our foreign subsidiaries functional currencies into U.S. dollars at the prior period\u2019s exchange rates.", "On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA segment would have increased 8% in the second quarter and 1% year-to-date. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations, as well as through exclusive marketing distributors.", "Direct markets sales accounted for 61% of EMEA's total second quarter sales and 58% of sales year-to-date. Direct market net sales declined 3% in the second quarter and 5% year-over-year when compared to the prior year period. These sales declines were primarily due to the general weakening of the euro, the currency in which a significant portion of the EMEA direct market sales are generated. Also contributing to the decrease in sales was the timing of customers orders compared to the prior year period.", "Our distributor markets accounted for 39% of EMEA's total second quarter sales and 42% of its sales year-to-date. Distributor markets net sales increased 9% in the second quarter and 2% year-to-date primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the currency in which a significant portion of EMEA distributor markets sales are generated. Also contributing to the growth was the higher sales of promotional activities associated with the WD-40 Multi-Use Product particularly in Northern Europe and the Middle East. This increase in sales was partially offset by lower sales in the Eastern Europe, primarily due to the economic conditions and political unrest in the Ukraine and Russia.", "Now onto the Asia-Pacific segment. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific segment, which includes Australia, China, and other countries in the region, increased to $13.9 million in the second quarter, up 28% versus last year. Year-to-date sales increased 20% to $30.9 million. The segment accounted for 14% of global sales compared to 12% in the second quarter of last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, sales in the Asia-Pacific segment would have increased 32% in the second quarter and 22% year-to-date.", "In Australia, net sales declined 2% in the second quarter and 1% year-to-date. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales results in Australia. On a constant currency basis, sales in Australia would have increased 7% in the second quarter and 4% year-to-date. This increase in sales was primarily due to the increased distribution and successful promotional activities in the period.", "Sales in China increased 57% in the second quarter and 12% year-over-year primarily due to new distribution and increased promotional activities in the region. The momentum we are seeing in China right now is very exciting and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term opportunities in this country. Although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the data building of distribution shifting economic patterns and the varying industrial activities.", "Sales in the rest of the Asian region increased 44% in the second quarter and 39% year-to-date. These increases were driven by improved sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product throughout most of our distributor markets including those of South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines. So that\u2019s it for the sales update and now over to Jay, who will continue the review with the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Garry, thank you. In addition to the information presented on this call, we suggest that you review our Form 10-Q for the quarter which we will file tomorrow. First, a look at our 50/30/20 rule, you may remember those are the measures we used to guide our business.", "As you recall 50 represents gross margin which we target to be above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at or below 30% of net sales. And then finally, the 20 represents EBITDA.", "For gross margin, it\u2019s above 50% and our cost of doing business is 30% or less. Our EBITDA will be at or above the 20%. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.", "The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q, as well as our investor presentation, which is available on our Investor Relation website.", "Now on to our gross margin or the 50 -- in our 50/30/20 rule. Gross margin in the second quarter was 52.6%, compared to 51.6% in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by decreased input costs and lower promotional discounts in all three segments along with select price increases primarily in Asia-Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rates in EMEA and changes in sales mix.", "A look at our input costs. We experienced a favorable impact of 130 basis points from our major input costs. This was driven by changes in the cost of petroleum-based specialty chemicals, as well as aerosol cans.", "As we explain during our first quarter earnings call, we expect to see net positive impacts on our gross margin when crude oil prices fall and we did see this in our gross margin in this quarter.", "As a reminder, although, approximately 35% of the input costs associated with the can of our WD-40 Multi-Use Product are made up of petroleum-based specialty chemicals, only a small portion of these costs are directly indexed to the cost of crude oil.", "Also impacting gross margin this quarter were lower promotional discounts, which had a favorable impact on gross margin of 50 basis points, primarily in the Americas and EMEA segments.", "Cost of promotional activities such as sales incentives, trade promotions, cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales. And the timing and magnitude of these activities can cause fluctuations in gross margin from period-to-period. In addition, our gross margin improved by 20 basis points as a result of price increases implemented in the last 12 months largely in Asia-Pacific.", "Garry discussed in detail how our changes in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on net sales. In addition to the impact they have on sales, they can also impact our gross margin. This is because in EMEA our costs of goods are sourced almost entirely in pound sterling. Well, approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros, 30% in pound sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars.", "Although, the dollar has strengthened against the pound sterling, the value of the euro deteriorated more significantly versus the sterling in the second quarter. These cause revenues in total to be worth less than pound sterling thus decreasing our gross margin.", "In the second quarter, changes in foreign currency exchange rates within our EMEA segment negatively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 80 basis points due to sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs, which increase from the second quarter of the prior year.", "The themes discussed for the quarter for gross margin also apply to year-to-date results. Gross margin year-to-date was 52.1%, compared to the 51.8% in the prior fiscal year. The increase of 30 basis points in gross margin was driven primarily by the decrease in input costs across all trading blocks along with price increases in Asia-Pacific and these favorable impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rate in EMEA and changes in our sales mix.", "Though we cannot avoid the impact of global market dynamics on items such as foreign currency or the price of crude oil, we continued to be focused and delivered in managing the rest of our business from maximum growth in our gross margin.", "Now on to the 30 or our cost of doing business. In both the second quarter and year-to-date, our cost of doing business was 34%, flat compared to similar period last year. While our goal is to have our cost of doing business be at or below 30% of net sales, we plan to continue our investments in new product development, brand protection, regulatory and quality assurance.", "As a result, we expect our cost of doing business to remain in your current levels throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. We expect to move closer to our target of 30% overtime as revenues grow ", "Year-to-date 76% of the total cost of doing business came from three areas, number one, our people costs or the investments we make in our tribe; also investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion and finally freight cost, the costs to get our products to our customers.", "Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the expense items that lead into our final EBITDA measure, first SG&A expenses. In both the second quarter and year-to-date, SG&A expense increased by 3% compared to the prior year period to $27.4 million and $54.8 million respectively. In the second quarter, SG&A expense decreased to 28.1% of net sales, down slightly from the 28.3% in the prior year period.", "Employee related expenses increased by $800,000 compared to the prior year period. These increases were primarily due to increased headcount as well as annual merit increases, which were implemented in the first quarter. These additional costs were partially offset by lower earned incentive compensation accruals. Professional services increased $200,000 over the prior year. This increase is associated with our continued investment in intellectual property protection along with higher legal fees associated with litigation.", "Finally, other miscellaneous expenses which include travel and median expense, depreciation expense, general office overhead, other costs increased $400,000 compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by $700,000 favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased to 28.3% of net sales compared to the 28.1% in the prior year.", "Year-to-date employee related expenses increased by $1.1 million compared to the prior year period. These increases again were primarily due to increased headcount annual merit increases implemented in the first quarter and were also partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. Also contributing to the increase in SG&A was travel and meeting expenses in support of our strategic initiatives which increased $400,000 when compared to the prior year.", "Finally, depreciation expense increased $300,000 compared to last year primarily due to our continued investment in our systems. These increases were partially offset by $500,000 favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates.", "We continued our investment in innovation and renovation by investing $1.7 million in the second quarter and $3.3 million year-to-date in R&D activities up from $1.4 million and $2.9 million in the same period last year. The majority of this investment is associated with our multi-purpose maintenance products and therefore directly supports our strategic initiatives.", "Our R&D tribe members engaged in consumer research new product development, product improvement and testing activity. Advertising and sales promotion expenses decreased by 9% in the second quarter to $5.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. As a percent of sales, A&P investment decreased to 5.6% in the second quarter compared to 6.4% in the prior year period. The decrease in the advertising and sales expense during the second quarter was primarily due to lower promotional -- lower levels of promotional programs and marketing investments primarily focused in the America\u2019s segment.", "The decreased expense was partially offset by increased investment in our Asia-Pacific segment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $200,000 in the second quarter.", "Year-to-date our advertising and sales promotion expense decreased by 2% to $11.4 million compared to the prior year period. As a percent of sales, A&P investment decreased to 5.9%, compared to 6.1% in the prior year period. The themes discussed for the quarter for advertising and sales expense also applied to our year-to-date results.", "As a reminder, it is common for advertising and sales promotion expense to fluctuate from period-to-period based on the types of marketing activities and/or promotional activities we imply within any given period.", "Amortization of intangible assets increased $100,000 to $800,000 in the second quarter of this year. Year-to-date, such expenses increased by $300,000 to $1.5 million for the year-to-date period.", "Total operating expenses in the second quarter were $33.6 million versus $33.3 million in the second quarter of last year. Operating income in the second quarter was $17.6 million, compared to $15.3 million in the prior year quarter.", "Year-to-date, total operating expenses were $67.7 million, compared to the $66.2 million in the same period of last year. This resulted in year-to-date operating income of $33.2 million versus the $32 million last fiscal year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures was 18% of net sales in both the second quarter and year-to-date periods, both of which were the same as the prior year periods. We target our EBITDA of 20% of net sales, but expect variations from time-to-time as sales, A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. Our EBITDA percentages also affected by investments we make for future growth.", "Well, that completes the discussion of the operating items for the second quarter and year-to-date. I will quickly review our other non-operating items. Interest income and interest expense in total remained relatively constant in both the second quarter and year-to-date periods compared to the prior year.", "Other expenses increased by $1.2 million in the second quarter and $900,000 year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. This increase was due to the higher foreign currency exchange losses as a result of the significant fluctuations in the exchange rates for the euro against the pound sterling.", "The provision for income taxes was 29.6% in the second quarter and 30.1% year-to-date versus 31% and 30.6% in the prior year periods, respectively. The lower tax rate was driven by an increase in the Company\u2019s earnings coming from foreign operations.", "Net income in the second quarter was $11.3 million versus $10.3 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $500,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, net income would have been $11.8 million in the second quarter.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.76 in the second quarter, compared to $0.67 in the prior year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding increased -- decreased to 14.7 million shares from 15.3 million shares.", "And year-to-date, our net income was $22.1 million, compared to the $21.8 million in the prior year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $400,000 on translation of our year-to-date consolidated results. On a constant currency basis, net income would have been $22.6 million in the year-to-date period.", "Diluted earnings per common share were a $1.49 year-to-date, compared to a $1.41 in the prior year period. Diluted shares outstanding decreased to 14.7 million shares from 15.3 million shares.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our balance sheet at February 28, 2015. Our balance sheet and liquidity continued to remain solid. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $43.7 million and we had $42.1 million in short-term investments, which consist of term and time deposits held in Money Center Banks.", "During the quarter, we borrowed an additional $5 million on our revolving line of credit. As a result, our debt outstanding was $103 million at the end of the second quarter. The $5 million increase in the line of credit balance during the second quarter was used primarily for share repurchases.", "Let\u2019s turn to capital allocation, we continue to return capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On March 24th, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share payable April 30, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 16, 2015.", "Based on today\u2019s closing price of $87.14, the annualized dividend yield would be 1.7%. During the second quarter, we acquired approximately 57,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $4.7 million. Between August of 2013 and February 2015, we repurchased roughly 849,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $60 million. And as a result, we\u2019ve exhausted our $60 million share buyback program.", "Our new plan which was approved -- which the Board approved on in October of 2014 became effective once the $60 million plan was exhausted. It provides authorization to acquire up to $75 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares through the plans and date of August 2016. Through February 28, 2015, no repurchases has been made under the $75 million plan but we\u2019ve started to execute repurchases under this plan in the third quarter.", "Well, that completes the financial overview. Again more information will be available on our Form 10-Q which we\u2019ll be filing tomorrow. And thank you so much and now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Great. Thanks Jay. Our underlying business is performing well right now. In constant currency, our global sales rates were much higher than those reflected in our actual results for the second quarter and the year-to-date.", "Foreign currency exchange risk is a reality that every international business must navigate. Today it\u2019s a headwind, tomorrow it may be tailwind although we can\u2019t control most of its influences on our reported results. Today we try to provide you with a better understanding of its impacts on our reported sales and earnings.", "And other dynamic we are currently navigating is the falling crude oil prices. Crude oil cost going down is certainly a net positive for our business. However, we are still uncertain exactly how that will embed in our business over the longer term or where they\u2019ll be in the future. We had a number of product increases planned this fiscal year to offset the cost of implementing certain new regulatory requirements, particularly in the Americas region.", "The recent declines in the cost of crude have allowed us to delay those planned price increases. We\u2019ve updated our fiscal year 2015 guidance to reflect our current view of the business. This guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and is based on recent foreign currency exchange rates.", "We expect that our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $387 million to $400 million or a growth of between 1% and 4%. We project gross margin to be better than 52%. We expect that global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 6% and 7% in net sales.", "We expect net income of between $45.1 million and $46 million which would achieve diluted EPS of between $3.07 and $3.13 assuming 40.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Despite the uncertainty that foreign currency and crude oil are causing in both our top and bottom line results, our underlying business is performing as we expected it would this fiscal year and in a way, which we believe will enable us to continue delivering strong returns to our stockholders over the longer term.", "So in summary, what did you hear from us on this call today? You heard that our business is performing well right now and that in constant currency, our global sales growth rates were much higher than those reflected in our actual results for the second quarter and year-to-date. You heard that the WD-40 specialist product line continues to perform well with global rate of sale increase of 17% year-to-date.", "You heard that crude oil cost going down continues to be a tailwind. However, we are still uncertain exactly how their impact will embed in our business over the longer term. You heard that later this fiscal year we expect to launch a new delivery system targeted at high volume and uses of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product that we believe will make the product even easier to use in workshops and factories.", "You heard that we continue to return capital to our stockholders and that we completed our repurchase under our $60 million share buyback program during the second quarter and that we begin executing the repurchases under our new $75 million plan during the third quarter.", "You heard that our underlying business is performing as we expected it would this fiscal year and in a way, which we believe will enable us to continue delivering strong returns to our stockholders over the longer term. And as I do, in closing, I\u2019d like to share a quote with you from Sue Grafton. Ideas are easy. It's the execution of ideas that really separates the sheep from the goats.", "Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019d be pleased now to open the conference call to your questions. Back to the Operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Gary. Good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Hey Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hi Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Gary, you had double-digit growth in the U.S. on the specialist line about 8% overall worldwide. Does the quarter-to-quarter growth rates in specialist sort of narrowed WD-40, they ebb and flow with promotional activities?", "Garry Ridge", "Not to say much promotion, Liam, more so in new distribution. Certainly, we did run our first promotion with specialist earlier this year. But it\u2019s a matter of building distribution and getting more of the product on shelf. In fact, if you were to go in a low store now you would see that come March, we actually have, I think up to eight U.S. co-use of specialist in distribution in those stores and many others. So year-to-date, our specialist growth is 17% and we are happy with where we are going with it.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Jay, in your breakdown of cost of goods, majority of it raw materials and obviously it\u2019s subject to the ebb and flow. 12% is non raw materials related. You\u2019ve done a lot of things in terms of manufacturing processes and redoing distribution. Do you see anything else you can do in that area?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, we\u2019ve got initiatives around sourcing of raw materials, which we\u2019ve seen benefits of over time as we see benefit from expanding our supply chain around cans for example is one. In EMEA, we\u2019ve added a new filler in Continental Europe that puts us closer to our customers. We did that in China as well a couple of years ago. So there is a variety of things that we can and are continuing to look at as we move forward.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Liam.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we move next to Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Hi. How are you?", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Linda.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hey.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "So, yeah, your constant currency sales growth in the quarter of 7% was very impressive, especially since I think you had some hard comparisons in the EMEA and Americas region and yet in your gross margin discussion you said that lower or less promos and discounts actually helped your gross margins.", "So if there was kind of less promotion and discount, how did you produced such good sales growth and is this something that is kind of -- we should expect a little bit more robust growth going forward, or is this really truly a strange situation in the quarter and why was that?", "Garry Ridge", "I think you\u2019ll find that particularly we had a solid sales growth down in Asia-Pacific. China performed very well. And of course, we had increasing distribution in our distributor markets. We had you may remember also that the shift of sales out of one quarter into another because of the Long Beach shipping to Bakkal may have also had some impact.", "In EMEA, we are seeing continued growth of specialists. We are seeing motorbike products continue to take lift. We just started distribution of bike over there. So it\u2019s really a shame that the currency is kind of shadowing the good work that they are doing over there.", "But overall, we would like to think that in normal times we can grow ourselves between 4% and 8% and this quarter was at the upper end of what our normal guidance is. So I think overall nothing extremely special. Obviously, we are expecting a reasonably solid second half of the year as well. It\u2019s just really now which way the currencies go but underlying we are very comfortable and very pleased with the great work tribe are doing.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "So remind to understand correctly that all of the reduction in the reported sales growth guidance is due to currency. You cut basically on the local currency -- you cut that expectation the same.", "Garry Ridge", "All of the -- what\u2019s lowered our guidance from the 4% to 8% which we had in our initial guidance is really currency impact.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then you alluded to this new delivery system Garry in the U.S. I think you said it was launching in the fourth fiscal quarter. Is this something that will help you garner more shelf space? Or are you losing some SKUs somewhere else? And is it higher margin products that have a higher average selling price?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes -- no, yes, yes. No, we weren\u2019t use shelf space. Yes, it is a highest selling product. It\u2019s a new version of our Smart Straw that\u2019s aimed at the heavy end uses, the industrial and tribe and we are very excited about it.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And so you are just starting in the U.S. and then perhaps more globally, or are there plans for global launch already in place or\u2026?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, challenge is making enough of it in the early stages. And when you see it and you will know within the next few months, you will think this is a pretty easy deal, but it\u2019s taken us four years to develop this and one of the components of it is particularly intricate in its manufacturing process.", "So it\u2019s really about getting ramping up production obvious to be able to take it globally. It will go globally eventually. I would say we will just see it in the U.S. probably for the next year as we betted in. And you know what we like, we like to do some pilot, try it, make sure we got it right, we think we have and then we will take it to the appropriate markets around the world.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "How easy do you think it will be for competition to copy the delivery method?", "Garry Ridge", "I got a few multiple millions of dollars and a lot of right research and development. They probably could, but it\u2019s like our Smart Straw, it\u2019s taken a long time for anybody to copy that. And even though that has copied it, the product is inferior.", "Nobody has that volume. Since we thought of selling Smart Straw, I think we sold about $1 billion worth of Smart Straw and it\u2019s our volume that allows us to cost effectively manufacture it where most of our competitors have no way near as you know the volume we have which really puts a lot of this innovation either prohibitive or severely impacting negatively their margins.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right. And then I know that you have mentioned that the Lawn & Garden is actually a smaller kind of potential sales effect than this new delivery system, but is the Lawn & Garden going to be launched in the U.S. or are you still deciding on that or\u2026?", "Garry Ridge", "We are still deciding. We certainly are comfortable with the results in Australia or in fact after this call today, I get on the plane and I am traveling down there and we will be reviewing it, but we will continue it down there. But it\u2019s a matter of productization and we believe that what we are doing with specialists in the U.S. in the new extensions that we put out this year, coupled with this new delivery system that we\u2019re developing. We can\u2019t be like the blind dog in a meat house.", "We got to take the juiciest piece of meat first and we think that\u2019s it. But lawn and garden is definitely not off our agenda in the U.S. But we are concentrating on what we think are the biggest opportunities first. We can\u2019t do everything and we\u2019ve got more opportunities now than we have execution power. So we need to pace ourselves and be deliberate.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right. And then just on the whole currency and thank you for the thorough currency explanation. That\u2019s very helpful. But I\u2019m just curious if in some markets where there is big currency devaluations, are you able to take pricing but I guess, I\u2019m trying to think these are your distributor markets in EMEA. So, I\u2019m not sure, does that mean you can\u2019t or can take pricing, or how does that work in terms of trying to offset that effect?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, let me talk about one that\u2019s probably on your mind, which is Russia. The rubles devalued at its top point around 60%, is down to around 40% now. We sell into that market in U.S. dollars.", "So our distributors are therefore making adjustments to pricing, which a lot of them have made. And we are in the same boat with a lot of other products, that has slowed down the market somewhat, not because of price but because of instability. There is now product at many different price levels. So we\u2019re waiting for that to flush through and then we\u2019ll see how it settles down. But Russia is probably the biggest one.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then just with the declines of crude oil and are you finding that -- I mean, it just sounds like your competitors are reacting a little bit and there is some reaction. So it\u2019s been harder in general to take the pricing. Can you give a little more color on the competitive actions regarding what\u2019s going on right now?", "Garry Ridge", "I\u2019m not sure I understand. But I think you said that our WD-40 competitors are doing stuff with pricing?", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "No, no. I mean you -- I mean, are they reacting to low crude price, some are being more aggressive on promotion or current prices I guess?", "Garry Ridge", "Not that we\u2019ve seen. They\u2019re in the same boat as us. They really don\u2019t understand the impact right now. And you just can\u2019t link one to the other. I think one of the learning moments that we\u2019ve had from this oil change is we\u2019ve spent thousands of the hundreds of hours trying to get our arms around what happens and it\u2019s really helped us understand a lot better into the future. What we do know is that when oil goes up, our prices from our supplier seem to go up a lot quicker than when oil goes down and that\u2019s an interesting learning moment that we\u2019ll be carrying forward in our experiences when prices start to rise again.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right. Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Linda.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.", "Ben Richardson", "Hello. This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Jeff.", "Garry Ridge", "Hey, Ben.", "Ben Richardson", "Hey. So, I just want to -- I look at the diagram here of the make up of the cost of can of WD-40. And it\u2019s clear that the petroleum component is coming down at least on a trailing six months run rate. Can you talk a little bit about the various raws and from steel can negotiations to plastics to the petroleum-based components and sort of rate at which those flow through your COGS?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, we can start with plastics because that\u2019s the one that has had really minimal impact at this point in time, even though there is a petroleum to plastic. The cost of our plastic Smart Straw mechanism is really -- has much more of a manufacturing, both cost associated with it, so those don\u2019t seem to change that much with the raw inputs. So, we haven\u2019t seen much change in our plastics. The cans have essentially remained somewhat at stable. We saw some overall can price decreases that we were able to achieve last year and then in through this year.", "As we look forward, we are not seeing a significant increase or decrease going forward in our can pricing. And we have been seeing kind of some benefits from certainly the cost of our some of the chemicals that are specifically indexed to crude oil. Those would be things for -- in some of our mineral spirits are directly -- we have some direct linkage to the cost of oil.", "The other petroleum-based chemicals have variety of market dynamics that are just not as clear and connected. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen some moderation but not at the same level. Hopefully that addressed the areas you\u2019re thinking about.", "Ben Richardson", "Yes. That\u2019s great. And just given your -- I guess jumping back quickly to revenues. Given your expectation of a stronger back half here, is that lot like seasonal? And I guess one of the different comments of any pickup you would expect in the back half?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, as with most of that years they depend on when certain promotional activities fall. We see a larger portion of that promotional activities come through the spring into the summer time, but that depends which half of the world you are in because half of the world we live in springs one time and springs another time in the other half of the world.", "So it\u2019s just basically -- we\u2019ve often -- you\u2019ve often seen or most times you see that our second half is normally a little heavily weight -- heavier weighted than the first half of the year. We don\u2019t have a big Christmas season anywhere. We don\u2019t mix very well with Barbie dolls and barbeque sets, but when those shelves are empty after that period of time of course we can move in. So I think it\u2019s nothing in particular, it\u2019s just a general business overall.", "Ben Richardson", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We do thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call. And we ask that you now please disconnect your lines."]}

Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge; and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.

Good day and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. I am pleased with the performance of our global business; yet foreign currency exchange headwinds are distorting our reported results. Hopefully, today we will throw some color on what that is.", "Today, you will hear that we reported net income of $11 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter. Year-to-date net income was $33.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.24.", "You will hear that we reported net sales of $92.5 million for the third quarter which is a 3% decline from the third quarter of last fiscal year. Year-to-date net sales were $286.2 million which is a slight increase year-over-year. You will hear that the Americas performed very well in the third quarter with a 10% increase in net sales.", "You will hear that Asia-Pacific is on track for a great year despite a product quality challenge we encountered during the quarter. You will hear that EMEA\u2019s base business is strong, but reported sales continue to be impacted by significant currency headwinds and political and economic instability in Eastern Europe.", "You will hear that the WD-40 Specialist product line continues to perform well with global growth rate of 26% in the third quarter and you will hear that later this month we are launching a new delivery system for the WD-40 Multi-Use Product in the USA.", "In the third quarter nearly 40% of our revenues were generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which means we are experiencing significant foreign currency headwinds particularly in EMEA. However, if you peel back the onion, our underlying business is performing well and in local currencies, seeing growth in all but a fuel-bound markets globally.", "While foreign currency exchange rates may have skewered the strength of our underlying business, we remain focused on our long-term strategic initiatives which are intended to drive organic growth despite foreign currency transaction and translation impacts.", "Let me remind you that we currently have four subsidiaries located outside of the United States that generate sales and do business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. They are located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and China. The main currency in which each of our subsidiaries conducts its business is called the functional currency.", "We have foreign currency translation exposure when we translate the results of our foreign subsidiaries from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar deflates the net sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and thus has a negative impact on our consolidated results.", "In addition to this translation exposure, our UK subsidiary also experiences foreign currency transaction exposure, because it conducts business in currencies other than its functional currency the pound sterling. A significant portion of EMEA\u2019s net sales are generated outside the UK and transacted in euros and U.S. dollars.", "When these sales are converted into pound sterling, EMEA reported results are impacted by the weakening of the euro against the pound sterling. In 2015, the euro has continually weakened against the pound sterling making transaction exposure more significant to our business. ", "Keeping the present currency environment in mind I will now discuss our sales results in greater detail. Consolidated net sales were $92.5 million in the third quarter and $286.2 million year-to-date. These numbers reflect the decline of 3% for the quarter and growth of nearly 1% year-to-date.", "If we take a closer look at the net sales by product group, we continue to be well positioned for sustainable growth of our multi-purpose maintenance products. We refer to this group as MPMP. We focus our time, talent and treasure on this product group and it accounted for 88% of our global sales in the third quarter. Consolidated MPMP sales were down 4% to $81.5 million in the third quarter and flat at $253 million year-to-date.", "By trading block, MPMP sales in the third quarter were up 12% in the Americas, down 18% in EMEA and down 12% in Asia-Pacific. Year-to-date, MPMP sales were up 4% in the Americas, down 7% in EMEA and up 10% in Asia-Pacific.", "If we take a closer look at the current quarter results, the increase in MPMP sales in the Americas was driven by strong growth of both a Multi-Use Products and Specialist sales throughout the trading block including double-digit growth of both categories. MPMP sales in EMEA in the third quarter decreased 18% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.", "Overall, in EMEA we saw double-digit growth of specialist despite currency headwinds. The decrease in MPMP sales in Asia-Pacific in the third quarter was attributed to a 28% decrease in our Asian distributor markets. This decrease was due to a defective aerosol can component that caused an evacuation failure in one of our sizes of our Multi-Use Product sold to our marketing distributors in various countries in Asia.", "We recorded a sales return allowance and we were not able to sell the product to this SKU to our marketing distributors in the third quarter due to the quality issue. Although our third quarter was negatively impacted by this event, it was an isolated incident and one which was quickly addressed from a quality perspective. Sales of MPMP products increased year-over-year in both China and Australia during the third quarter.", "Turning to our homecare and cleaning products groups. Sales were $11 million in the third quarter and $33.2 million year-to-date, up 1% in both periods. The product group accounted for 12% of net sales in the third quarter. By trading block, sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the third quarter were up 1% in the Americas, up 6% in EMEA and down 3% in Asia-Pacific. Year-to-date sales were flat in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and up 7% in Asia-Pacific.", "As a reminder, our homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S. are considered harvest brands that continued to generate positive contribution and cash flows, but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business as net sales of multi-purpose maintenance products grow with the execution of our strategic initiatives.", "Now onto the results by segment. Let\u2019s start with the Americas. Net sales in the Americas, which includes the United States, Canada and Latin America, increased to $49.7 million in the third quarter, up 10% versus last year. Year-to-date net sales in the Americas increased to $139.2 million, up 4% versus last year.", "Looking at the U.S. alone sales were up a 11% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date. During the third quarter the U.S. experienced double-digit growth for all MPMP products due to the increased distribution and higher level of promotional activities. In the U.S. we experienced 21% growth of the WD-40 Specialist product line in the third quarter and now 17% year-to-date.", "In Canada net sales were up 7% in the third quarter and down 3% year-to-date. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales results in Canada. In its transactional currency the Canadian dollar sales increased by 19% in the third quarter and 6% year-over-year.", "Total Latin American sales were up 7% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. The sales increases in Latin American for both periods was due to higher sales of the WD-40 Multi-Use Products primarily in Mexico due to a successful promotional program which was conducted in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015.", "Now over to EMEA, net sales in the EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $30.3 million in the third quarter, down 17% versus last year. Year-to-date sales decreased 7% to $103.6 million. The EMEA results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by currency headwinds as well as the political and economic instability in Eastern Europe.", "Since our results fluctuate due to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we also discussed our sales in what we call constant currency. For that we translate the current period results from the foreign subsidiary functional currency in the U.S. dollars at the same period last year exchange rates. On a constant currency basis sales in EMEA would have decreased 9% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. But wait, there is more. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors.", "The direct market sales account for 67% of EMEA\u2019s total third-quarter sales and 61% of sales year-to-date. Direct market reported sales declined 6% in the third quarter and 5% year-over-year. Now here is the more, these sales declines were entirely due to foreign currency exchange impacts. If we look at the local currencies in which sales are transacted in EMEA - in the direct markets. In the United Kingdom, we sell in pound sterling sales increased by 15% in the third quarter and 10% year-over-year.", "In the European direct markets where we sell in euros sales increased 9% in the third quarter and 6% year-over-year. So there you have it. Currency headwinds of securing what is going on within our Europe direct markets. Our distributor markets accounted for 33% of EMEA\u2019s total third quarter sales and 39% of sales year-to-date. Distributor markets net sales decreased 33% in the third quarter and 10% year-to-date primarily due to a significant decrease in Eastern European sales particularly in Russia and Ukraine where there continues to be political and economic instability.", "During the third quarter we recorded no sales in Ukraine and we\u2019ve only recorded sales for Russia in the last month of this quarter. Unfortunately, at this point experts are uncertain on how long this political and economic situation in Russia and the Ukraine will last.", "Now Asia-Pacific, net sales in Asia-Pacific which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region decreased to $12.5 million in the third quarter down 11% versus last year. Year-to-date sales increased 9% to $43.4 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis sales in Asia-Pacific would have decreased 6% in the third quarter and would have increased 12% year-to-date.", "In Australia reported net sales were flat both in the quarter and year-over-year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales results in Australia. In its transactional currency the Australia dollar sales increased by 16% during the third quarter and 8% year-to-date. Sales in China increased 10% in the third quarter and 11% year-over-year due to the continuing billing of distribution much of which came from Southern China and ongoing promotional activities throughout the country.", "We continue to be optimistic about the long-term opportunities in this region although we expect a lot of volatility along on the way due to the timing of promotional activities and programs, the building of distribution, the shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "Sales in the rest of the Asian region decreased 28% in the third quarter as I mentioned earlier this decrease was due to a product quality issue linked to a defective aerosol can component in one SKU sold to our Asian marketing distributors. The issue was quickly identified and rectified and we do not anticipate having any further disruptions. We do not expect that sales in the Asian distributor markets will be negatively impacted in the future period by this product quality issue.", "Year-to-date sales in the Asian region increased 15% year-to-date primarily due to the increased sales of WD-40 multi-purpose product throughout most of the distributor markets including those of South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia.", "Now I would like to provide you with an update on our strategic initiatives. Our strategic initiative number one is to grow the WD-40 Multi-Use Product the blue and yellow can with a little red top. Our goal under this initiative is to take the WD-40 Multi-Use Product to more places for more people and with more uses.", "Under the umbrella of strategic initiative number one, we are really excited to finally give you a sneak peak of our innovative new delivery system and it\u2019s on Slide 10 of our third quarter results earning presentation that\u2019s currently on our website. ", "Additionally, you can see a glimpse of our teaser campaign at www.wd40.com/ez. Much like our Smart Straw it was designed to make WD-40 Multi-Use Product even easier to use. The delivery system is on this new product is designed to make the hard to reach, easy to reach.", "The product will not replace any of our current delivery systems, but rather is an additional SKU for our end users to choose. It\u2019s scheduled to be on select store shelves in the U.S. by the end of this month. ", "Strategic driver number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories within identified geographies and platforms. The WD-40 Specialist product line continues to grow and sales of the product line increased 26% in the third quarter and 20% year-to-date.", "We continue to launch new Specialist categories in the markets around the world. Although, each market and country and segment experiences different short-term trends relating to the sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line. We continue to believe that WD-40 Specialist will be a sustainable and substantial revenue and earnings growth engine for many, many years to come.", "Strategic driver initiative number three \u2013 broaden our product base and revenue. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within our Company to derive revenue from new sources outside of our WD-40 flagship brand. WD-40 BIKE continues to grow and we\u2019ve expanded our product line and it is now available in 19 countries at thousands of retailers around the world.", "During the third quarter we continue to broaden distribution of our products. Our newest 3-IN-ONE product Lock Dry Lube was on the store shelves in retail channels in the U.S. for the first time in the third quarter.", "Strategic initiative number four attract, develop, retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop and retain our most valuable resource, our tribe. We welcomed 10 new tribe members during the third quarter bringing our total number of new highs year-to-date to 48.", "Developing our tribe and building our Company\u2019s bench strength for our future success remains a top priority. During the third quarter, we concluded our fourth year of leadership lab, a program created to facilitate understanding of our leadership principles and values in order to develop the next generation of leaders within our organization. In total, we\u2019ve had a 162 tribe member\u2019s graduate from various levels of leadership lab in the past four years that\u2019s nearly 40% of our tribe globally.", "Finally, our organization was recently recognized for the fifth consecutive year by WorldBlu as one of the most Freedom-Centered Workplaces for high levels of innovation, accountability and transparency.", "Strategic driver number five operational excellence. This initiative includes the continuous improvement of resources, systems and processes in order to help offset rising costs and protect our operating margin.", "We continue to make progress on several initiatives and we plan for fiscal 2015. We made additional progress in the implementation of the upgraded ERP system in EMEA and in June we went live with our new system at our Italy branch.", "I mentioned in the past that one of the projects we planned in fiscal year 2015 under the strategic initiative was to transition all 50 states to a lower VOC formula we launched in California in fiscal year 2014. We continued working with our manufacturing partners on test production runs and preparations for the upcoming transition, but it will not occur this fiscal year. There are no negative ramifications as a result of this change to our plans, but the cost associated with the implementing of these regulatory requirements will shift now into 2016.", "I\u2019ll take a break now. And I\u2019ll be happy to hand over to Jay who will continue the review of our financials. Thanks Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. In addition to the information that we are presenting on this call today, we suggest that you review our Form 10-Q for our quarter which we will file tomorrow. Let\u2019s first review our 50/30/20 rule, as you may recall those are the measures we used to guide our business.", "The 50 represents our gross margin which we target to be above 50% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at or below 30% of net sales. Finally, the 20 represents EBITDA.", "If our gross margin is that above the 50% and our cost of doing business is 30% or less. Our EBITDA will be above our 20% target. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in our 10-Q, and in our investor presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website.", "Now, we\u2019ll look at our gross margin the 50 in our 50/30/20 rule. Gross margin in the third quarter was 53.3%, compared to the 51.4% in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by decreased input costs in all three trading blocks. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rates in EMEA and increased discount and other allowances primarily within our Americas and Asia-Pacific trading blocks.", "Our cost of products sold a look at \u2013 closer look at input costs. We experienced a net favorable impact of 260 basis points from our major input costs. This was driven primarily by changes in the cost of petroleum-based specialty chemicals and to a lesser extent aerosol cans.", "As we\u2019ve shared with you in the past it takes considerable time, approximately 90 to 120 days for change in commodity prices to impact our cost of goods sold. All three trading blocks are net positive impacts to gross margin due to lower crude oil prices one of the primary feedstock\u2019s of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals.", "As Garry mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve delayed the transition to all 50 states for the lower VOC formula of the Multi-Use Products which was launched in California during fiscal 2014. However, when we move forward with the implementation, we will expect to see some increase in our cost base. Also impacting gross margin this quarter were improved warehousing distribution and inbound freight costs, which had a favorable impact on our gross margin of 30 basis points mainly in the Americas.", "As you may recall last year we had some elevated expenses due to a promotion in the U.S. that had special delay display configurations which resulted in increased storage and transportation costs. Transportation costs were also higher last year due to disruptions caused by adverse weather conditions.", "In addition, our gross margin improved by 30 basis points as a result of the sale price increases implemented in the past 12 month in certain markets in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Gross margin had another positive impact of 30 basis points due to the combined effects of sales and exchanges and other miscellaneous costs.", "The overall favorable sale and exchanges in the Americas and EMEA more than offset the additional costs associated with the write-off of defective goods in our Asian distributor markets. These improvements to margin were partially offset by increased promotional discounts and allowances which had an unfavorable impact of 110 basis points in the third quarter. This was driven by increased advertising promotional spending and investment in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.", "Change in foreign currency rates impact our net sales, but they also impact our gross margin. In the third quarter foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our margin by 50 basis points. This is because that EMEA our cost of goods are sourced almost entirely in pound sterling well approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros with 30% pound sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars. Although the U.S. dollar strengthened against the pound, the euro deteriorated against the pound compared to last year. As a result revenues in total were worth less in pound sterling and thus decrease in our gross margin.", "The themes that we\u2019ve just discussed for the third quarter for gross margin also apply to our year-to-date results. Gross margin year-to-date was 52.5% compared to 51.6% in the prior year. Though we cannot control global market dynamics such as the impact of foreign currency or the price of crude oil we continue to be focused and deliberate in managing the rest of our business for maximum growth in our gross margin.", "Now on to the 30 our cost of doing business. In the third quarter our cost of doing business was 35% up from 34% the same period last year. While our goal is to have our cost of doing business at or below 30% of net sales we plan to continue investments in our new product development activities, brand protection, regulatory compliance and quality assurance.", "As a result we expect our cost of doing business to remain near current levels throughout the remainder of the year. We expect to move closer to our target of 30 over time as our revenues grow. Year-to-date 76% of the total cost of doing business came from three areas; people costs or the investments we make in our tribe; the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion and freight costs; the cost to get our products to our customers.", "Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our expense items that lead to our final EBITDA measure. First SG&A expenses. In the third quarter SG&A expense declined by $300,000 compared to the prior year to $26.6 million. As a percent of net sales SG&A expense increased to 28.8% for the third quarter compared to 28.1% last year. The decrease in the SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to the impact of $1.1 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease of $800,000 in professional service costs.", "The decrease of professional service costs primarily driven by lower legal fees associated with litigation intellectual property protection activities as well as reduced consulting services in our Americas and EMEA segments. These decreases were offset by $1 million increased in employee related costs a $200,000 increase in costs for travel and meetings and $400,000 of increased other miscellaneous expenses.", "Year-to-date our SG&A expense increased by $1.2 million compared to the prior year to $81.4 million. As a percentage of net sales SG&A expense increased to 28.5% year-to-date compared to 28.1% last year. Year-to-date the increase in SG&A was primarily attributable to higher employee related costs, which increased by $2.2 billion compared to the prior year period.", "These increases were primarily due to increased headcount and annual merit increases implemented in the first quarter and were partially offset by lower earned incentive compensation accruals. Also contributing to the increase in SG&A expense was travel and meeting expenses in support of our strategic initiatives, which increased $700,000 compared to the prior year. Depreciation expense increased $400,000 compared to last year, primarily due to our increased investments in systems.", "Finally, other miscellaneous expenses increased $400,000. These increases were partially offset by $1.7 million impact due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as $800,000 decrease in professional service costs associated with litigation intellectual property protection activities and general consulting services in our Americas and EMEA trading blocks.", "We continued our investment in innovation and renovation by investing $2.2 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million year-to-date in research and development activities, which is up from $2 million and $4.4 million in the same period last year. The majority of this investment is associated with our multi-purpose maintenance products and directly supports our strategic initiatives.", "Advertising and sales promotion expense decreased by 15% in the third quarter to $5.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of sales A&P investment decreased to 6% in the third quarter compared to 6.8% last year. The decrease in advertising and sales promotion during the third quarter was primarily due to lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, which was offset by increased promotional activities in the Americas trading blocks.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of $300,000 on A&P expense in the third quarter. Year-to-date advertising and sales promotion expense decreased by 6% to $16.9 million compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, A&P investments decreased to 5.9% compared to 6.3% in the prior year period.", "The decrease in advertising and sales expense year-to-date was primarily due to a lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in EMEA. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of $400,000 on A&P investments during the year-to-date period.", "As a reminder it is common for advertising and sales promotion expense to fluctuate period to period based on the type of marketing activity or promotion we employ. The amortization of intangible assets increased by $100,000 to $800,000 in the third quarter of this year, year-to-date such expense has increased by $400,000 to $2.3 million due to - primarily to our intangibles that we acquired in the GT85 acquisition completed earlier this year.", "Total expenses in the third quarter were $32.9 million versus $34 million in the third quarter last year. Operating income in the third quarter was $16.4 million compared $15.1 million in the prior year quarter and year-to-date total operating expenses were $106 million compared to $102 million for the same period last year. This resulted in year-to-date operating income of $49.6 million versus $47.1 million last fiscal year.", "EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/20 measures was 19% of net sales in the third quarter up from 17% in the prior year period. Year-to-date EBITDA was at 18% of net sales and flat compared to last year. We target EBITDA of 20%, but expect variations from time to time as sales A&P investment and other expenses fluctuate with the timing of our activities. Our EBITDA percentage is also affected by the investments we made for future growth.", "Well that completes the discussion on our operating items for the current quarter and the year-to-date. I will quickly review our other non-operating items. Interest income and interest expense in total remain relatively constant in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods.", "Other expenses increased by $400,000 in the third quarter and $1.3 million year-to-date these increases are primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses as a result of the significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro against the pound sterling.", "The provision for income taxes was 30.2% in the third quarter and 30.1% year-to-date. This is compared to 30.4% and 30.6% in the prior year periods. The lower tax rate was driven by the portion of the Company\u2019s earnings from foreign operations which are taxed at decreasing rates.", "Net income in the third quarter was $11 million versus $10.4 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency rates had an unfavorable impact of $500,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by $1.1 million in the third quarter.", "Our diluted earnings per common share were $0.35 in the third quarter, compared to $0.69 in the prior year quarter. Diluted shares outstanding decreased to 14.6 million shares down from 15.1 million shares last year.", "Year-to-date net income was $33.1 million, compared to $32.2 million in the prior year period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $800,000 on the translation of our year-to-date consolidated results. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by $1.7 million in the year-to-date period.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $2.24 year-to-date, compared to $2.10 in the prior year period. Diluted shares outstanding decreased to 14.7 million shares from 15.2 million shares in the same period last year.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our balance sheet at May 31. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $46.9 million and we had $48.3 million in short-term investments, which consist of time, deposits held in Money Center Banks.", "During the quarter, we amended our line of credit agreement with Bank of America to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to 2020. It increased the revolving commitment to $150 million and to revise the financial covenants. In addition, other changes to the credit agreement now permit us to classify draws on the line of credit as long-term provided certain conditions are met. You will see this classification change on our balance sheet for the current quarter.", "In the third quarter we barrowed an additional $5 million on our revolving line of credit. As a result, our debt outstanding is $108 million at the end of the period. The $5 million increase in the line of credit balance during the third quarter was used for share repurchases.", "A quick word about capital allocation, we continue to return capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On June 23, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share payable July 31, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 17, 2015.", "Based on today\u2019s closing price of $88.82, the annualized dividend yield would be 1.7%. During the third quarter, we acquired approximately 136,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $11.3 million. This plan which was approved in October of 2015 became effective March 1, 2015 and it provides authorization to acquire up to $75 million with Company\u2019s outstanding shares through the plans end date August 2016. ", "Well, that completes the financial review. More information will be available on our Form 10-Q which we\u2019ll be file tomorrow. Thank you so much and now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Jay. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our view for the remainder of the fiscal 2015. We\u2019ve updated our full-year 2015 guidance. It reflects the impact of foreign currency exchange movements as well as the macroeconomic and political challenges in our European markets particularly in Russia and Ukraine as well as the quality issues identified in Asia-Pacific. This guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestiture activities and is based on recent foreign currency exchange rates.", "We expect our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of $383 million to $390 million which will mean either flat or a growth up to 2%. We project gross margin to be better than 52%. We expect that global advertising and promotional investment to be in the range of 6% and 7% in net sales. We expect net income of between $44.5 million and $45.4 million which would achieve EPS of between $3.03 and $3.09 assuming 40.7 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "So in summary and closing business continues to perform well. Foreign currency exchange headwinds will continue to impact our reported results, but we believe it remain focused on our long-term goals we will navigate this environment just as we\u2019ve gone the past. In summary what did you hear from us on this goal? You heard that the Americas performed very well in the third quarter with 10% growth rate overall in revenue. You heard that Asia-Pacific is on track for a great year despite minor hiccup in the quarter there are up 9% year-to-date.", "You heard that EMEA\u2019s base business is strong, but the reported sales continue to be impacted by significant currency headwinds and political and economic instability in Eastern Europe. You heard that the WD-40 specialist product line continues to perform well with the global growth rate of 26% in the third quarter. You heard that crude oil costs going down continues to be a tailwind and we have seen the positive impact of lower input cost in our gross margin.", "You heard that later this month we\u2019ll be launching our new delivery system for WD-40 Multi-Use product and that is design to make the hard to reach, easy to reach. You heard that we continue to return capital to our stockholders and that we\u2019ve begun executing repurchase under our new $75 million plan during the third quarter and you heard that we amended our line of credit agreement which extended the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to 2020 increasing the line of $150 million and revised financial covenants.", "So in closing, I\u2019d like to share a quote with you with you from Mike Casca. To be successful, you must accept full challenges that come your way. You can\u2019t just accept the ones you like. Thank you for the call - joining us on the call today and we will be happy to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley & Company.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Hi, guys, how are you doing?", "Garry Ridge", "Good. How are you?", "Jay Rembolt", "Hi, Linda.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Good. Hi. So first of I guess just a question on Eastern Europe and the weakness you are seeing there now. Did I understand you correctly but you said the only posted some sales in Russia in the last month of the quarter and yes so last quarter I think that the distributor markets in EMEA were up 9%.", "So I\u2019m kind of wondering how did this weakness kind of it caught you by surprise or it took time to settle into the market or I\u2019m just wondering how embedded this weakness is being that it was still pretty strong last quarter and also can you quantify it like is Russia and Ukraine what percentage of the EMEA distributor markets with that be roughly.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay, firstly we\u2019ve been seeing the activity in Russia and Ukraine I think we mentioned in a couple of times what we soul was a period of time where inventory in the market as being absorbed. So we think that right now we\u2019re starting to see inventory coming back into the market from us. We do about 10 million cans a year in Russia.", "So I guess that's about a $10 million business plus or minus that's real rough. So that's about the extent of it. The Ukraine is a lot less. The rest of the distributor markets in Europe are still performing well. In fact you're right they grew last quarter and excluding the Ukraine and Russian business they grew in the third quarter of this year.", "So it's really isolated around the Russian economy inflation there went through the roof and took some time for it to settle. We believe it will settle down and we\u2019ll see aspect of some type of normalized business in the next couple of quarters, it\u2019s just a hiccup. And I am not sure when it took us for a surprise. I think it\u2019s just was something that we didn't understand the extent of the timing of it and we\u2019re back on track again I think as long as Russia continues to improve.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "I mean did you take any price increases there in Russia that maybe is making this be a temporary situation and then when the pricing pieces settle in the growth will return?", "Garry Ridge", "No. We didn't. The ruble deteriorated against the dollar, so we sell into Russia in U.S. dollars. So our marketing distributors there did take some pricing. We also help support that with some promotional activities of free goods to sort of minimize that, but \u2013 yes the price has increased, but it's truly because of the ruble.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay. Thanks. And then just kind of seeing what\u2019s happening in China I think people are bracing themselves for slower overall economic growth in China. Is that something that you're seeing at all or do you suspect that could happen there as well?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, China is going to continue to be a bumpy ride. The thing that we love about China is that there are a lot more people who don\u2019t know us than know us. Sure, it\u2019s growing at 8% to 10%, we do better, but we\u2019re doing, we see China long-term as a large market, since opening, we\u2019ve taken the revenues from a couple million to 15 or so, we\u2019re growing at 10% this year. We think we\u2019ll see growth again next year, it will bump around quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s a journey that we\u2019re on and we\u2019re continuing on the path.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay. And then your new product here, that's going to be launched here, did you ship any of that at all in the third fiscal quarter or will the shipments begin in the next quarter in the fourth quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "They're all in this quarter. There was none in Q3. They started shipping this week. That's why you couldn't find them in the stores.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay. And then I mean it looks I haven't looked at all the pictures here, but the [bending neck] looks interesting, but it looks actually bigger than the straw application. So is it for a different type of application and I assume this would be purchased by the user in addition to the straw type application? Is that true?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. Basically the extended tube on this is about eight inches in length. And it's completely flexible. So what it's meant to do is enable the delivery of our product to places that are very hard to get at with a normal can. Firstly, without a straw it's impossible to get there. And with our Smart Straw it can get there, but our heavy end-users particularly in automotive, industrial one of the big feedback points we got from our research over the past couple of years was we'd love to be able to deliver the product to these hard to get places easier.", "So it's a bigger can. It's designed to appeal to our heavy end-users. And we believe that it will be in a can that they will have on the shelf as well as the other. It has a higher price obviously because that delivery system costs more. There's been a lot of innovation, a lot of work going into it. We have a patent on it. So we're excited to take it to the end-users and you should see displays initially in-store within the next week or so. The first stores will be Home Depot and then other retailers will follow soon after or other supply chains will follow soon after. ", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "And how fast do you think you can ramp up the distribution reach of it in the U.S.? Do you think you'll get 80% there by the end of next fiscal year or even quicker?", "Garry Ridge", "I don't know. I think one of the things that we're working on now is demand. One of the key components of this is actually manually assembled right now. Our supply partners are in the late stage of putting in automated assembly equipment. So that's a bit of a pacing item. So I'd say by the end of this year we will have distribution in four or five of our major supply channels.", "And then we'll see where we go from there. So it will take time. And then of course after that, the world is to come. You know how we do things, Linda. We're deliberate and we're not here as a bottle rocket. We're here to grow our revenue with our end-users over time. So it will be interesting to see and we're excited to see how it moves off the shelf when it hits in a very attractive display configuration in the next couple of weeks.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Great. And then can I just ask you in terms of the VOC implementation, is there any way to quantify how much in those costs will be shifted to FY 2016, is that a $1 million or couple million or any quantification?", "Garry Ridge", "We haven\u2019t shared that yet.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay. And then just finally, the quality issue here that you have with the one SKU in Asia, I know these things happen in everything, but a kind of you have something in Canada that happened I think about a year ago as well.", "Garry Ridge", "Totally unrelated.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Right, but I\u2019m wondering if you \u2013 if there needs to be some improvement or modification of your monitoring of the outsourced suppliers when they are manufacturing the components and the product?", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you for the question, it was impossible to do that. These products \u2013 the product that we manufactured past all of our quality control stringent testing as it left. And the issue was not apparent until about three weeks after the product shift, because it took that long for the extender to actually disengage from the under of the valve.", "So it was quite \u2013 it was really intriguing for us, but we\u2019re fortunate enough that this happened while product was on both shipping across the Pacific Ocean and when we then tested it on arrival which we do, at our distributors, we identified the problem so we don\u2019t know how we would have identified this problem other than the way we did and I'm extremely proud of our quality people and the way that we\u2019re able to actually catch this before it even got into the market. It only got to the actual distributor warehouses, so they did a great job.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, so there are no end user ended up with this problem in their hands?", "Garry Ridge", "Correct.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, great. Okay, I guess that\u2019s pretty much it for me. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Linda.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen with no further questions in the queue. That will conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}

Good day and thanks for joining us for today's conference call. To sum up fiscal year 2015 it was the best of times and it was the worst of times. Fiscal year 2015 was a year of solid operating performance that was obscured by the impacts of political events, economic instability, a strong U.S. dollar and a particularly weak Euro against the pound sterling. We are proud that we've been able to build a global company and we currently generate approximately 40% of our sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. With this comes foreign currency risk. We currently have four subsidiaries located in the United States, I'm sorry outside of the United States that generate sales and do business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. They are located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and China.", "The main currency in which each of these subsidiaries conduct business is called its functional currency. We have foreign currency translation exposure when we translate the results of our foreign subsidiaries from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. The continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar deflates the net sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and thus has a negative effect on our consolidated results. In addition to this currency translation exposure our UK subsidiary also experiences foreign currency transaction exposure, because it conducts business in currencies other than its functional currency the pound sterling. A significant portion of EMEA's net sales are generated outside of the UK and transacted in Euros and U.S. dollars. When these sales are converted into pound sterling EMEA's reported results are impacted by changes in the currency exchange rates for those two currencies. In 2015, the euro has continually weakened against the pound. This transaction exposure has been most significant to our business.", "Today, we reported consolidated net sales of $378.2 million for full fiscal year, which is a 1% decline from last fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales were $92 million, which is 6% decrease from the fourth quarter of last year. The impacts of changing foreign currency exchange rates significantly reduced that net sales in fiscal year 2015. When you take, both translation and transaction exposure into consideration, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our total net sales by around $16 million for the full year.", "Consolidated net sales were reduced by about $11 million due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our subsidiary. This is the translation related exposure. In addition, consolidated net sales were reduced by about $5 million, primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the euro. This is the transaction related exposure. However, despite these challenges, we reported full year net income of $44.8 million and a diluted earnings per share of $3.04. In the fourth quarter, net income was $11.7 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80.", "So, what happened? Let\u2019s start with the EMEA segment, i.e. -- and this is where we experienced the most significant challenges, particularly related to currency headwinds. Net sales in EMEA, which include Europe, Middle East, Africa and India, decreased to $136.9 million for the full fiscal year, down 10% versus last year and $33.2 million in the fourth quarter, down 17% versus last year. EMEA\u2019s results in the quarter and full year periods were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange headwinds as well as the continued political and economic instability in Eastern Europe.", "We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors. Direct market sales accounted for 63% of the EMEA\u2019s total sales in fiscal year 2015 and 70% in the fourth quarter. Our direct market sales declined 7% in the full year and 12% during the fourth quarter. The declines in both periods were almost entirely due to foreign currency exchange rates.", "I want to share with you our EMEA direct market sales results in the local currencies in which they are transacted. In the United Kingdom where we sell in pounds sterling, sales increased 9% for the full year and 30% for the fourth quarter. In Europe direct markets where we sell in euros, sales increased by 6% for the full year and for the fourth quarter. These sales increases in local currencies were due to the continued expanded distribution and growth of our base business in these markets. So they have currency headwinds during the crew\u2019s results and growth in our European direct markets.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the regions distributor markets, which accounted for 37% of EMEA\u2019s total fiscal year sales and 30% of sales during the fourth quarter. Distributor market sales decreased 14% in the fiscal year and 26% in the fourth quarter. This is the first time in 10 years that we fail to achieve full fiscal year growth in the EMEA distributor markets. This was primarily due to three reasons; the continued political and economic instability in Russia, including a massive currency devaluation and accompanying recession. For the first full fiscal year of sales in Russia declined about 30% compared to last year.", "The ongoing political and economic instability to Ukraine, including combat in the Donbass region, which is the industrial heart lane of the country, for the full year, sales in Ukraine declined 77%. Sales declined in the Middle East, primarily due to lower sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product in Afghanistan.", "Our marketing distributors in Russia and the Ukraine are actively pursuing strategies to reestablish products in these countries. But despite our optimism for economic and political stability, we\u2019re unable to predict the immediate reach for these markets. We find confidence in the fact that virtually all of the remaining distributor markets continue to see year-over-year growth. Although sales throughout EMEA were challenged throughout the year, in this fiscal year WD-40 Specialist product line sales was strong. Reported sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line in EMEA increased 16% in the full year and 19% during the fourth quarter.", "So let\u2019s now jump back across the palm and discuss our results in the Americas. Net sales in the Americas, which include the United States, Latin America and Canada, increased to $187.3 million for the full fiscal year and 48.1 million in the fourth quarter. Both periods were up 4%, the percentage sales growth in the Americas segment was even higher if we look only at our maintenance products. Maintenance products in the Americas increased 5% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter. For both periods this growth was due to higher maintenance product sales in the US and Latin America, driven by new distribution and successful promotional programs. These increases were partially offset by sales declines in Canada, which were significantly impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Looking a little closer at the U.S. sales were up 4% in the full year and 6% during the fourth quarter driven by higher maintenance sales.", "In the US sales of WD-40 Multi-Use product were up 3% in both periods and sales of WD-40 Specialist were up 25% for the full year and 49% in the fourth quarter. The sales increases for WD-40 Specialist for both periods, was due to new distribution and increased promotional activity. Total sales in Canada were down 8% for the full year and 20% during the quarter. In its functional currency the Canadian dollar sales were up 3% for the full fiscal year but down 7% for the fourth quarter. The declines in the fourth quarter were driven by the timing of our promotional activities. Total loads in Latin American sales were up 7% for the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter.", "The sales increases in Latin America for both periods were due to higher sales of WD-40 Multi-Use product primarily due to high level of promotional programs and increased distribution particularly in Brazil and Mexico. As a reminder our maintenance products exclude our home care and cleaning products. We can consider our home care and cleaning products particularly those in the US as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flow but are generally expected to become a smaller part of our business over time. ", "Now let's take a look at Asia-Pacific. Net sales in Asia-Pacific which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region increased 6% to 54 million in the full fiscal year and decreased 5% to 10.6 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis sales in Asia-Pacific would have increased 10% for the full year and 4% for the fourth quarter. In Australia reported net sales were down 3% for the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on these results. In its functional currency the Australian dollar sales were up 10% in the full year and up 13% in the fourth quarter. This growth was due to increased distribution and promotional activities in both periods.", "Sales in China increased 10% for the full year and 7% in the fourth quarter due to new distribution much of which came from Southern China and in ongoing promotional activities throughout the country. We continue to be optimistic about the long term opportunities in this region although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the billing of distribution, shifting economic patterns and the varying industrial activities. Sales to our Asian distributor markets increased 11% for the full fiscal and decreased 12% during the fourth quarter. Increased sales in the full fiscal year were driven by higher sales volume of WD-40 Multi-Use products in markets particularly of South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia. The decline in sales in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by the high level of purchases made by our customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in advance of price increases implemented in the region in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. I'm going to take a break and hand over to Jay who'll continue on with a review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. In addition to the information presented on this call I suggest that you review our press release which is issued earlier today as well as our 10-K report for the fiscal year 2015 which we'll expect to file on October 22nd. Let's start with a discussion about how we performed against our most recent fiscal year guidance. We projected our fiscal year net sales results to be in the range of 383 million to 390 million which meant flat to growth of 2%. Today we reported fiscal year revenue of 378.2 million reflecting a decline in sales of about 1%.", "As Garry discussed in detail the stronger than anticipated impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as the economic and political challenges in some of our European markets made it difficult for us to forecast topline sales results. We project gross margin to be better than 52%. And today, we reported gross margin of 52.9%. We expected our global advertising and promotion investment to be in the range of 6% to 7% of net sales. And today, we reported our A&P investment of 6% of sales.", "We expected net income to be between $44.5 million and $45.4 million, which would have achieved diluted earnings per share of between $3.03 and $3.09, assuming $14.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Today, we reported net income of $44.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.04, based on $14.6 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "Now, on to our 50/30/20 Rule. For many years, we\u2019ve run our business by what we call our 50/30/20 Rule. We used this rule to guide and measure the performance of our business. Under the 50/30/20 Rule, 50 represents gross margin, which we target to be above 50% of net sales. 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales. And finally 20 represents EBITDA. If our gross margin is above 50%, then our cost of doing business is 30%, we\u2019ll generate EBITDA above 20%. The descriptions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available on our SEC filings and in our investor presentation which is available on our investor relations Web site.", "Beginning this year, in fiscal 2016, we are changing to a new 55/30/25 Rule. This means we\u2019ll be targeting gross margin of 55%, cost of doing business at 30% and EBITDA of 25%. By aligning the organizations behind these stretch targets, we will continue to improve the financial performance of our business.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our fiscal 2015 results. So the last time under our 50/30/20 Rule; first, gross margin. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 54.3% compared to the 52.7% last year, driven primarily by the net favorable impact of 230 basis points from major input cost. This is primarily due to decreases in the cost of crude oil, one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum based specialty chemicals. These improvements in gross margin were partially offset by changing foreign currency exchange rates. In the fourth quarter, foreign currency exchange rates adversely affected our gross margin by 70 basis points. This is because the [EMEA] (ph), our cost of goods are sourced almost entirely in pound sterling, or approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros, 30% in pound sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars. The euro deterioration against the pound more than offset any benefit from the strengthening U.S. dollar. As a result, revenues in total were less than pound sterling thus decreasing our gross margin. Although there were several other items that impacted gross margin, they were individually insignificant.", "The themes that we just discussed for the fourth quarter for gross margin, also apply to the full fiscal year. Gross margin was 52.9% compared to the 51.9% in the prior year. Major input costs had a less favorable impact of 160 basis points. Foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted gross margin by 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. All other items combined had an unfavorable impact on gross margin of 10 basis points.", "If the cost of crude oil goes up significantly in the future, we will surely see some impact to our gross margin. But the new gross margin goal of 55% that we are targeting is not continuous on oil staying at any particular price point. We cannot control the global market dynamics, such as the price of crude, but we will continue to be focused and deliberate in managing the rest of our business for continued growth in our gross margin towards that target of 55%.", "Now, I\u2019ll address our cost of doing business. In the fourth quarter, our cost of doing business was 35% compared to the 34% last year. For the full fiscal year, our cost of doing business was 34%, flat to last year. The revenue decline for the fiscal year negatively impacted our cost of doing business percentage. We expect to move closer to our target of 30%, over time as revenues grow. While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, and we plan to continue the investments we make in research and development, brand protection as well as regulatory and quality assurance.", "For the full fiscal year, 76% of the cost of doing business came from three areas; our people costs or the investments we make in our tribe; our marketing investments; and the cost to get our product to our customers for the fourth quarter SG&A expense decreased to 27.4 million down from 28.3 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower earned incentive compensation, lower professional service costs and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs associated with new product development.", "For the full fiscal year our SG&A expense increased slightly to a $108.9 million up from a $108.6 million last year. We continued our investment in innovation and renovation and invested $3.5 million during the fourth quarter and a record $9 million for the full fiscal year. This investment is associated with our maintenance products and directly supports our strategic initiatives. Our innovation team engages in consumer research, product development, product improvement, and a variety of testing activities. Today our organization has more resources in places to manage product innovation, product renovation, product quality, regulatory and consumer safety than ever before in the company's history.", "Advertising and sales promotion expense increased by 2% to $6 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in advertising and sales promotion expense was primarily due to higher level of activities and programs in the Americas. For the full fiscal year, our A&P expense decreased by 4% to $22.9 million. As a percentage our A&P investment decreased from 6.2% to 6% for the full year. The decrease for the full year was primarily due to lower level of promotional programs and marketing support in EMEA. And that bring us to EBITDA, the last of 50/30/20 measures. EBITDA was 19% of net sales for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Looking at amortization, the amortization in tangibles remained constant at approximately $700,000 in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. For the full year such expense increased by $400,000 from $2.6 million to $3 million primarily due to the intangibles acquired in the GT-85 acquisition completed at the beginning of the fiscal year.", "Total operating income in the fourth quarter was $15.8 million versus $16.6 million in the same period last year. Operating income in the fiscal year was 65.4 million compared to 63.7 million in the prior year. And net income for the fourth quarter was 11.7 million versus 11.5 million in the prior year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $800,000 on the translation of our consolidated results for the quarter. Our diluted earnings per common share were $0.80 in the quarter compared to $0.77 in the prior year period. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.5 million shares from 14.9 million shares in last year's quarter. And now net income for the full year at 44.8 million versus 43.7 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted our results $1.7 million for the full fiscal year.", "Now diluted earnings per common share were $3.04 for the fiscal year compared to $2.87 in the prior year. And our diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.6 million shares from 15.1 million shares last year. A word about our capital allocation. We continue to return capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On October 2nd, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 a share payable October 30th, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business tomorrow. Based on today's closing share price of $93.39 the annualized dividend yield is 1.6%. During the fourth quarter we repurchased 50,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $4.4 million under our share repurchase plan and during the full fiscal year we repurchased 386,000 shares at a total cost of $30 million. ", "Our latest share repurchase plan became effective March 1st, 2015. And it provides the authorization to acquire up to $75 million of the company's outstanding shares through the plan's expiration date in August of 2016. In addition to growing our earnings our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow we also focus on another metric - return on invested capital. For the fiscal year 2015 our return on invested capital was an exceptional 27.2%, and that provides our financial overview. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Jay. Take a moment now to review how we\u2019re making progress on our strategic drivers. The strategic drivers for this year for the Company, number one, is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use product. Our goal under this initiative is to take WD-40 Multi-Use product that little blue and yellow can with the red top to more places for more people with more users. In the fourth quarter, we launched our newest product, WD-40 EZ-REACH, which is a 14.4 ounce can of WD-40 Multi-Use product featuring an innovative flexible straw. Though it\u2019s still early, we\u2019ve seen encouraging point of sales results. And so far, the end user results have been -- reviews have been positive. We are currently distributing the product at three U.S. retailers and we expect to add several more by the end of fiscal year 2016.", "Strategic initiative number two, is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line, which celebrated its fourth birthday this year. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories within identified geographies and platforms. Despite all the macroeconomic events that we accounted this year, WD-40 Specialist still achieved a global growth rate of 24% for the full fiscal year and 36% during the fourth quarter.", "For the full fiscal year, WD-40 Specialist global sales generated about 6% of the revenue that we saw from the WD-40 Multi-Use product. Over the next 10 years, we believe we can grow that number to 25%. When we report first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings, we will begin to provide additional information for investors about the performance of the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "Strategically initiative number three, is to broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the strengths within our Company to generate revenue from new sources outside of our flagship WD-40 brand. We continue to broaden our revenues with products like WD-40 BIKE and new products within our three-in-one brand. At the end of fiscal year 2015, we started a plan for the transition of WD-40 BIKE\u2019s business in the U.S. from one to distribution limited to independent BIKE dealers to one which will now also include the same multiple trade channel distribution network and customers, which currently are in place for our other maintenance products in the Americas segment. We will continue to develop or acquire maintenance products that fit well within our unique multiple trade channel distribution network.", "Strategic driver number four is to attract, develop, and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop, and retain talented tribe members. This quarter we welcome nine members and this year, we welcome 57 new tribe members in the full year than those ever in a single year. This included a mix of both new and backfill positions, which grew our global tribe to 433 people around the world. While we do not expect to add headcount of this rate, this investment in our most valuable resource positions us well for future growth.", "Strategic driver number five is operational excellence. This initiative includes the continuous improvement of resources, systems, and processes in order to help us offset rising cost and protect our operating margin. We made great progress on several initiatives in fiscal year 2015. We made enhancements to our supply chain in both the Americas and EMEA. We continue our preparations for the 50 U.S. states transition to the lower VOC formula we launched in California during 2014. We continued our focus on category leadership, which has totally transformed the way we talk to our customers about our product. And we made additional progress on the implementation of the upgraded ERP system in EMEA.", "So, let\u2019s look at what 2016 has to hold. In 2016, our guidance is that net sales will grow between 6% and 8% with net sales expected to be between $400 million and $408 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 53%. Advertising and promotional expenses are projected to be between 6% and 7%. Net income is projected to be between $47 million and $48 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.26 and $3.33 based on an estimated $14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to the current levels.", "Now, let me repeat that last part because it\u2019s important. This guidance assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain close to current levels. In closing, despite the decline in our topline consolidated results, I\u2019ll say our business continues to perform well. Foreign currency exchange rate headwinds may continue to impact our reported results but our strategy for growth is one for the long term. I believe vision crushing roots ritual of the pressure of quarterly earnings is not the measure of success. A company must have a clear and compelling vision, a set of core values that drive the culture, values must be clearly acted upon. A clear set of strategic drivers must determine how our time, talent, treasure and technology are invested to achieve our stated outcomes. Looking ahead we say the opportunity is double the sales of their multiuse product and grow WD-40 Specialist to about 25% of that amount, essentially doubling the size of our business over the next ten years. How? ", "By doing exactly the same things we've been doing for the last decade and bringing it to a bigger and broader global audience. Ultimately, we believe our topline growth combined with disciplines of our business model will continue to increase stockholder value. So in summary what did you hear from us on the call today. You heard that currency exchange rates continue to challenge our reported results, particularly in the EMEA segment and thus we suffered a decline in full year reported sales for the first time in five years. You heard that if you remove the impacts of those currency exchange rates we are growing in almost all of our markets. You heard that the Americas segment is performing well and in line with our expectations with a 4% growth rate for the full fiscal year. You heard that our Asia-Pacific area continues to grow despite some currency headwinds with a 6% growth in the full fiscal year.", "You heard that WD-40 Specialist product line is performing above expectations with global growth rate of 24% in the fiscal year and you heard that we launched the WD-40 EZ REACH and we've seen encouraging point of sale results so far. You heard that beginning this fiscal year we are committing to a new rule the 55/30/25 Rule. You heard that crude oil cost going down continue to be a tailwind and we're seeing positive impact from lower input costs and you heard that we continue to return capital to our stockholders and that for fiscal year 2015 our return on invested capital was 27.2%. In closing I'd like to share a quote with you from Charles Dickens. \u201cFor our path in life is stony and rugged now and it rests with us to smooth it out. We must fight our way onward, we must be brave, there are obstacles to be met and we must meet and crush them.\u201d Thank you for joining us for the call today. We'd be pleased now to open the conference call for your questions. Back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley and Company, please proceed with your question.", "Zach Cummins", "Hi, this is Zach Cummins. I'm in for Linda right now. My first question is, we did a little research and we found about a 34% retail price premium at Home Depot for your EZ REACH product in comparison to just your regular multiuse product. Does that sound about right to you and then how much of an effect will EZ REACH have on the U.S. sales mix?", "Garry Ridge", "That sounds right, I think it's $7.88 in Home Depot, and I'm not quite sure how I'd answer your second question on sales mix.", "Zach Cummins", "Okay, thank you, and then if I remember correctly I think you said the EZ REACH is with three distributors at this point. And I was wondering how long do you think it'll take to reach full distribution and then do you think are there still supply constraints for the product.", "Garry Ridge", "We are currently shipping product to Home Depot, Lowes and Auto Zone. We expect by March next year to be shipping to a number of other customers. Depending on demand we would, we feel that by the middle of next fiscal year we should have reasonably good wide distribution in the United States then after that it would be what we need to consider for that global market.", "Zach Cummins", "All right, great, that's all from me.", "Garry Ridge", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question", "Liam Burke", "Thank you, good afternoon Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry could you give us, could you give any sense as to specialist sales how they trend in emerging markets versus more developed markets. Looks like the U.S. is hitting its stride, but I mean how does that compare to the ramp up in a market like China.", "Garry Ridge", "Specialist is very limited in China, Liam the first thing we need to do is to make the shield famous and then take Specialist in after as you may have heard on the call, Specialist is now at about 6% of our MUP sales, and we\u2019re pretty happy with that. But most of those are coming originally, a big portion from the U.S. and then from EMEA the more mature markets and Australia. We have some business in some of our distributors, but that\u2019s the longer term build. Our goal at the moment is to get to our 25% of MUP number in the more developed markets like U.S., the UK, Australia, France, Germany those sort of areas and then later we\u2019ll continue on building it in more of the emerging markets, as we build the awareness of the core brand of the blue and yellow can.", "Liam Burke", "Okay, so just sticking with -- just second. Your growth rates in China reflect that you have probably primarily Multi-Use product sales?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes.", "Liam Burke", "Jay, do you have any -- in your -- the efforts to step up or what you\u2019ve done and moved up gross margins. Do you have any capital projects, or is there any capital investment that needs to be made for you to achieve your objectives on the gross margin fronts?", "Jay Rembolt", "We have few initiatives around some machinery for line speeds and line efficiencies\u2026", "Garry Ridge", "And EZ REACH\u2026", "Jay Rembolt", "And certainly EZ REACH has an opportunity to improve margin as well.", "Liam Burke", "Great\u2026", "Jay Rembolt", "When we get volumes up\u2026", "Liam Burke", "Well, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

[Operator Instructions]", "I'd now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today's call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today.

Today we reported net sales of $92.5 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2016, which was a decrease of 4% from Q1 of last fiscal year.", "Net income for the first quarter was $12.1 million compared to $10.8 million in Q1 last fiscal year, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.83, compared to $0.73 for the same period last fiscal year.", "As we review our results for this quarter, we will be doing so under the umbrella of our 55/30/25 rule and our strategic initiatives. While global sales continue to be negatively impacted by changing foreign currency exchange rates our gross margin has increased to nearly 56% which has resulted in record net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter.", "Before we dive into the financials, I'd like to take a few moments to update you on our strategic initiatives. Its' a New Year and a great time to get off to a fresh start. In this world, we only have a few things, we have time, we have talent, we have treasure and we have technology. None are abundant. So it's really important for us as an organization to focus on where we see the biggest opportunities. I'd like to take just a few minutes today to remind you of what those opportunities are for WD-40 Company and what our long-term targets look like.", "Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Everyday our tried members wake up with one thing on their minds, take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people that will find more uses more frequently. We ended fiscal year 2015 with global sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product of $292 million. Our long-term target under this initiative is to double our sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product over the next 10 years, that\u2019s a target of approximately $600 million. How? By doing exactly the same thing we've been doing for the last 10 years. We're going to make more end users aware and we're going to make it easier for them to buy in a 176 countries and territories world-wide, in 62 different trade channels.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the Specialist product line. Once we build brand equity and establish the power of the shield in a particular geography, we can leverage that brand recognition to develop new product lines like WD-40 Specialist. We believe we can grow WD-40 Specialist to approximately a $125 million in revenue over the next 10 years. In the first quarter sales of WD-40 Specialist, they were $4.3 million, which represents a 2% increase over the first quarter of last year.", "We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities of WD-40 Specialist as we've shared, however there will be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution and various other factors that come normally with building out a new product line.", "Strategic initiative number three is broaden our product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from new sources and brands. We continue to expand the product offerings within our 3-IN-ONE and GT-85 brands as well as the WD-45 Product line. In the first quarter, we continue to make great progress with these products and are excited about their contributions to our maintenance product revenue in the future.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop and retain talented tribe members. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 436 tribe members globally. I get up every morning and I think about two things, our people and our brand. Bottom line, if we want to maximize the productivity and profitability, we have to engage our employees. Our long-term target under this initiative is to grow employee engagement to greater than 95%.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. We've refreshed this initiative slightly to reflect our operational objectives. It encompasses continuous improvement by optimizing resources, systems and processes as well as rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection.", "We will measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to processes and systems while safe guarding the blue and yellow can with the little red top.", "That completes the update on our strategic initiatives, so let's move on to the details of our first quarter results starting with sales.", "Consolidated net sales were $92.5 million in the first quarter down $3.8 million versus last year. In the first quarter, we generated approximately 35% of our sales in currencies other than U.S. dollar. Therefore, changing foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a significant headwind for us. If we were to remove all foreign currency exchange impact, our consolidated revenue would have been $96.8 million, up slightly over the first quarter of last year.", "When you take both translation and transaction exposure into consideration, changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduce their total net sales by around $4.3 million in the first quarter.", "Consolidated net sales were reduced by about $3.7 million due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, this is what we refer to as translational related exposure or constant currency. And it impacts reported results in Canada, Australia, China and the EMEA segment. In addition, consolidated net sales were reduced by about 600,000 primarily due to the weakening of the Euro against the Pound sterling. This is what we refer to as transaction related exposure, and it only impacts reported results in our EMEA segment.", "Now let's take a closer look at what's happening in the individual segments. We'll start of course with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas which includes the United States, Latin America and Canada decreased to $44.4 million in the first quarter down about 1% from last year. On a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas for the first quarter would have remained constant at $44.8 million when compared to the prior year.", "Sales of maintenance products increased about 1% in the Americas, primarily due to sales increases in the United States driven by promotional activities and initial distribution of our new WD-40 EZ-REACH product. In total, maintenance product sales increased by about 4% in the U.S. during the first quarter.", "This increase in the U.S. was primarily offset by declines in maintenance product sales in both Canada and Latin America. Maintenance product sales in Canada were down 15% during the quarter. These declines were due entirely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In its functional currency, the Canadian dollar sales maintain \u2013 maintenance \u2013 sales and maintenance products increased by 2%.", "Maintenance product sales in Latin America were down 6% in the quarter due to the timing of customer orders. We sell all our products in U.S. dollars in Latin America, so currency does not impact our reported results in the region.", "As a reminder, our maintenance products excludes home care and cleaning products. We continue to consider our home care and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions in cash flow but are generally expected to become a smaller part of our business over time. Sales of our home care and cleaning products in the Americas decreased by about 7% from last year.", "Let's jump across upon to EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA which includes Europe, the Middle-East, Africa and India decreased to $32.1 million in the first quarter, down about 7% from last year primarily due to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange headwinds as well as the unstable market conditions in Russia. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as marketing distributors.", "Reported consolidated sales in our EMEA direct markets which accounted for 61% of the region sales were flat for the quarter at $19.4 million. However, if we look at our results in local currencies, we saw the following growth in our direct markets. In pound sterling base direct markets, sales increased by 13% in the quarter. In Euro base direct markets, sales also increased by 13% in the quarter. The sales growth in local transaction currencies was due to increased sales and new distribution primarily in Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the Germanics region.", "Now let's turn to our distributed markets which accounted for 39% of the EMEA sale during the quarter. Distributed market sales decreased 17% in the first quarter due to a 35% decrease in sales in Russia due to the unstable market conditions in the region. Although market conditions have begun to stabilize, we are experiencing significant declines in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year.", "Now let's move down to Asia Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia Pacific which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region decreased to $16 million in the first quarter down about 6% from last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia Pacific would have been $17.2 million, an increase of 1%. In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were down 18% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on these results. In its functional currency, the Australian dollar, sales were up 4% for the quarter. This growth was due to increased distribution and the continued growth of our maintenance products.", "In China, net sales remain relatively constant compared to last year at $2.9 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on China results. In its functional currency, the Chinese RMB, sales were up 3% for the quarter. The growth was due to increased distribution, particularly in southern China and higher sales levels resulting from promotional activities. We are optimistic about our long-term opportunity in these regions, in this region although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and varying industrial activities.", "In our Asia distributed markets, net sales were down about 1% compared to last year. The decline in sales was driven primarily by the timing of customer orders. The Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell our product in U.S. dollars to that region.", "And now I'd love to turn over to Jay who will continue with the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thanks, Garry, and Happy New Year to everyone else on the call today. First, let's review our newly revised 55/30/25 rule. That\u2019s the measure we used to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales. And finally, the 25 EBITDA, if our gross margin is 55% and our cost of business is at 30%, our gross margin will be 25%, excuse me, our EBITDA will be 25%.", "First, the 55% or our gross margin. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 55.6% compared to the 51.6% last year. Gross was positively impacted by 260 basis points from major input cost changes, and a 160 basis points from various other items. These gross margin improvements were partially offset by changing foreign currency exchange rates which adversely impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points.", "Let's start with the major input cost which include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans. Crude oil is one of the primary feed stocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals. And in the first quarter of last year crude oil was priced at roughly $85 a barrel, which compares to roughly $45 a barrel during the first quarter of this year. Though it takes time for the changes in the cost of crude oil to make its way into our supply chain and multiply into our financials, we're now seeing more of the benefit of continued lower crude oil cost in our gross margin.", "It is impossible to predict when crude oil \u2013 what crude oil will cost tomorrow or next year. The falling oil prices have been a net positive for our gross margin, when the cost of oil goes up in the future we'll most likely see pressure on gross margin. However, our new long-term gross margin target of 55% is not contingent upon oil staying at any particular price point. We cannot control global market dynamics such as the price of crude oil or fluctuations and currencies, but we will continue to be focused and delivered in managing the rest of our business so that we can maintain gross margin at a level close to our target of 55% over the long-term.", "Let's talk briefly about some of those other items that impacted gross margin in the first quarter. We had isolated price increases that were implemented in the last 12 months had an favorable impact on gross margin of 40 basis points, these were implemented in Asia Pacific in the third quarter and to a lesser extent in the EMEA in the first quarter of this year.", "Gross margin was also positively impacted in the first quarter by 40 basis points due to lower distribution and inbound freight cost, particularly in the Americas segment. Lower promotional discounts had a net favorable impact on gross margin of 30 basis points. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentive, trade promotions and cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales. But the timing and magnitude of these activities can cause fluctuations in our gross margin period-to-period.", "Gross margin was also positively impacted by 50 basis points due to sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs. These improvements of gross margin were partially offset by changing foreign currency exchange rates.", "In the first quarter, foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted the gross margin by 20 basis points. This is because, in EMEA our cost of goods are primarily sourced in pound sterling, while approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in Euros, 30% in pound sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars. The Euro deterioration against the pound more than offset any benefit from the strengthening U.S. dollar. As a result, revenues in total were worth less than pound sterling, thus decrease in our gross margin.", "Now, we'll look at the 30, our cost of doing business. In the first quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 35% compared to the 34% last year. In the first quarter the reported revenue decline as well as increased earned employee incentive accruals negatively affect that our cost of doing business percentage. While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make investments to support our fifth strategic initiative that is operational excellence. And this includes investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safe guard the blue and yellow can with the little red top.", "We expect to get closer to our target of 30 overtime as revenues continue to grow. For the first quarter, 77% of the cost of doing business came from three areas, people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion, in the quarter our A&P investment was 6.1% of revenue and the freight cost, the cost to get our products to our customers.", "And that three exist to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 20% of net sales in the first quarter compared to 18% in the first quarter of last year. The increase was driven primarily by the improvements to gross margin. Net income for the first quarter was $12.1 million versus $10.8 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates at an unfavorable impact of $500,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter.", "Diluted earnings for common share were $0.83 in the quarter compared to $0.73 for the same period last year. And diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.5 million shares from the 14.7 million shares in the prior year quarter.", "Now a word about capital allocation. We continue to focus on returning capital to our share holders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On December 8, 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per share reflecting an increase of 11% over the previous quarter's dividend of $0.38 per share. With this rise we have increased our dividend for five consecutive years for a total increase of 48% over that time period. And based on today's closing price of $94.58, the annualized dividend yield is 1.8%.", "During the first quarter, we repurchased a total of 92,000 shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $8 million under our share repurchase plan. Our latest share repurchase plan because effective March 1, 2015 and it provides authorization to acquire up to $75 million of the company's outstanding shares through the plan's expiration date in August 2016. As of November 30, we had $51.2 million remaining under the plan. Over the last five years, the company has repurchased over a $185 million in shares.", "So with that, let's turn to our fiscal year 2016 guidance. We've updated our guidance to take into account today's foreign currency headwinds and our crude oil price tailwinds. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain close to current levels, net sales growth is projected to be between 4% and 6% or between $393 million and $401 million.", "Gross margin for the full year is expected to be above 54%. And advertising and promotion expenses are projected to be in the range of 6% to 7% of net sales. And net income is projected to be between $47.5 million and $48.5 million. Diluted earnings per share expected to be between the range of $3.30 and $3.37 based on an estimated $14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "As a reminder, this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that currency exchange rates in crude oil prices will remain close to current levels.", "Well that completes the financial overview. Now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. I had said it before, but it warrants repeating, I believe the vision crushing ritual of the pressure of quarterly earnings is not the measure of success. A company must have a clear and compelling vision, a set of core values that drive the culture. Values must be clearly acted upon, a clear set of strategic drivers must determine how time, talent, treasure and technology are invested to achieve the stated outcomes.", "So in summary, what did you hear from us on this call today? You heard that foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind and reduced their net sales results by approximately $4.3 million in the quarter. You heard that the U.S. is performing well and is in line with our expectations with a 4% growth of maintenance product sales of the first quarter. You heard that our EMEA direct markets continue to grow in their local transaction currencies by 13% in the quarter. You heard that falling crude oil prices continue to be a tailwind and that way I think positive impacts in their gross margin. You heard that our net income and earnings per share both set new records in the first quarter. You heard that we increased our dividend by 11% last month and that we have increased our dividend over the last five years. You heard that we are raising our gross margin and net income and EPS guidance for our fiscal year 2016.", "So today, instead of a quote, I've thought I'd end the call in a different way. I'd like to share this thought with you, at WD-40 Company, every single one of us comes to work every day to do something we love. We get to inspire people and to create positive lasting memories. It's the most wonderful thing in the world, in fact, the fun part is trying to figure out all the different ways we can do that.", "Thank you for joining us on today's call. And we'll now turn it back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.", "Linda Weiser", "Hi guys, Happy New Year.", "Garry Ridge", "Happy New Year, Linda.", "Linda Weiser", "So, I guess my first question is, I mean obviously you're finally kind of showing the big benefit of the lower petroleum-based input cost in your gross margin. And it looks like to me you are reinvesting as you mentioned your SG&A ratio was a little bit higher than I would have thought. I guess my question is, when oil if it ever does kind of go back up then your gross margin may come down some. How do you reverse or I mean, how do you make up for the fact that the SG&A additions, I assume it's like people, you can't really reverse that. So I guess I'm a little concerned that you're kind of adding lot of cost structure because you do have this tailwind but later on when it reverses you can't reverse the cost side. So can you kind of explain that a little bit?", "Garry Ridge", "Sure. Two things, the SG&A ratio to revenue is impacted by one, the revenue. And currently, our revenue rate, particularly because of exchange rates is down. So that is having an impact on us. Secondly, the investments we are making in fact are not in people and as Jay shared with you, they are around things like quality assurance, regulatory compliance, intellectual property investment. So, we are very focused and we are very, very determined around our goal of 55%, as you saw in the quarter we are above that. Certainly about 2.6% of that 55% is around the benefit of oil. So if you really think about it our underlying gross margin against our goal of 55% is currently, if oil was 80% at about 53% or above.", "So, well you know what we are and you know how we think about our cost in this company. We're not on some wild man's dream here of spending before we earn it, we will meet our goal of 55/30/25 over time and we're very focused on doing that. So I appreciate your concern but I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And can I also ask just about the sales growth. I think you acknowledge that it wasn\u2019t quite up to what you would have hoped and even excluding all the currency and quite frankly, I think at least relative to my modeling work it's been like that for the last year, year and half. And it's hard for me to really dissect, is it the non-strategic home care piece or is the maintenance products piece also a little bit below where you would like it to be. And why is that? I mean is it competition, is it failure to be able - or inability to price more or why do you think it's not \u2013 I mean the economies are still relatively strong around the world. So what do you think is going on?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, in the U.S., our core business grew 4% in the quarter and we're very delighted with that. The home care and cleaning products were down $1.7 million in the quarter, so certainly they are down, they were flat, globally down $1.7 million. If you go to Europe, where we're seeing growth in the domestic markets, direct markets in the quarter of about 13% that got wiped out by exchange rates. Where the softness is, we are still seeing a softness in Eastern Europe around the distributor markets and then we've got the normal timing thing that\u2019s going on.", "I would have liked to seen a little bit of volume globally in the first quarter, mainly stuffs moved around. So I'm not really concerned about it, we still believe in our 4% to 6% for the year ex-currency, that\u2019s what were the update was in the guidance. So when you're operating in a 176 countries and 62 trade channels around the world you're going to have things move around from time-to-time, but our underlying business in our maintenance products area is very, very solid. And we continue to move along to our goal to double our Multi-Use Product business and to take Specialist to a $125 million over time.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And of that, like a half a point roughly of sales growth excluding all the currency, can you break that down between volume and price in the quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, there wasn\u2019t really much price at all.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay.", "Garry Ridge", "Because the only price rise we had was a little bit of a GT85 in the UK, this is volume, it's not price.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And then can you just talk about in terms of the EZ-REACH launch in the U.S., have you gotten more distribution since we talked about it last quarter or how is that progressing exactly with the launch?", "Garry Ridge", "Yeah, thanks for the question. We \u2013 the initial point of sale results for the EZ-REACH remain encouraging, they've actually exceeded our original assumptions. At this time the product is only being distributed in the United States. We have not yet made the decision of when we will take it globally. We\u2019ve shipped the products in the United States to Home Depot in August, AutoZone in September and Lowe\u2019s in October. We will ship the rest of the EZ-REACH product to Wal-Mart this month and we have several additional customers we expect to ship in the second quarter of 2016.", "And by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year, we should have EZ-REACH opened up to all U.S. customers and be able to fill the orders for the products for all of U.S. customers.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And then do you think that means in FY17 you might be able to start selling it abroad?", "Garry Ridge", "Certainly we believe that EZ-REACH has global potential. And once we've feel comfortable that we have production and any other bugs that we could find, not that we found any yet, we'll then take it to the more developed markets around the world. I know my friends in Australia are very anxious to get it and I know that our friends in the UK and in Germany are very anxious to get it, and we would think that that would be the first sort of areas we'll go.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And I mean are you able to say how much it contributed to U.S. growth, I mean is it measurable, is it even half a percent or is it just too small?", "Garry Ridge", "We do know, but we're not sharing that at this time.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And then you mentioned the Specialist growth in the quarter\u2026", "Garry Ridge", "Yeah.", "Linda Weiser", "I think it was a single digit number, is that\u2026", "Garry Ridge", "2.3%.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. That seems a little low, is that including FX?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, well that\u2019s net of the FX. So we had the impact of FX, brought it down to 2.3%.", "Linda Weiser", "Do you know what it was prior to the impact of FX?", "Garry Ridge", "I don\u2019t have that, I don\u2019t think we've disclosed that, but I guess if you think FX was $4 million and I know it's probably 5% to 6% more, I'm not sure, to take FX over the [total] [ph].", "Linda Weiser", "Okay.", "Garry Ridge", "But you know, the thing that\u2019s going to happen with this Linda, and everybody listening to this should hear this, we're not going to \u2013 you cannot, you can but there is no value in poking at us quarter-to-quarter about Specialist growth. It's going to like China and everything else. We did \u2013 we shared that our sales last year are about $20 million so we took it from zero to 20 from launch and it's going to bubble around over time as we take to new places. This is not an overnight sensation, this is a build the brand day-by-day, market-by-market, we are very happy with Specialist, we see $125 million with it over time, there is nothing but green lights around it and it's just a matter of us now being deliberate and solid in our execution around it.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. Maybe if I could just turn to a couple of questions for Jay, just on the tax rate in the quarter was a little bit lower than I had modeled in. Should I be modeling 30.5% for the year or something a little bit lower?", "Jay Rembolt", "We had some changes in activities at the end of last year which suggest that we should \u2013 we're seeing it'd be under 30%. So 29% - slightly above 29%.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And then your operating cash flow was actually pretty strong in the quarter. I know it probably moves around by quarter, but was there was anything unusual, it looks like the accounts receivable and \u2013 or accounts payable on accrued liabilities line maybe was very positive. Is that unusual or what's going on there?", "Jay Rembolt", "No, I mean I think that it really has a lot to do with just the timing of sales in the quarter. You'll see a variety of activities on the AR line that will change. There is really nothing significant that\u2019s been happening, in some ways, we did have an increase in inventories over the period which was an offset. So, but nothing of note.", "Linda Weiser", "Okay. And then finally, can you just remind me, I know you mentioned this before but like if you took the EMEA distributor markets, what percent of Russia, Ukraine of that, is it like half or?", "Garry Ridge", "No.", "Jay Rembolt", "It's a good size, but it's not quite half.", "Garry Ridge", "No. It was about $10 million in one year I think, last year. But Jay\u2026", "Jay Rembolt", "Somewhere \u2013 it's about 40 \u2013 35%, 40%...", "Garry Ridge", "40%, okay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Is when it is tracking.", "Garry Ridge", "And the difference is that, we hadn't yet \u2013 in the first quarter of last year Linda, we hadn't yet seen the massive drop in Russia, so we had a very \u2013 we haven't \u2013 we're not kind of lapping the decline yet. The decline in Russia started in the second and third quarter. So we had a pretty reasonable first quarter last year in the distributor markets in Europe because Russia hadn't started the impact that really yet.", "Linda Weiser", "Yeah, no I realize that, I think it's probably going to be not until the second half of the fiscal that it may grow, but I want to \u2013 you said it was nearly stabilized and that\u2019s not the same as stabilized. So it sounds like it's still going down or something.", "Jay Rembolt", "No, it won't, only if you compare \u2013 if we look at it now, if we looked it's last quarter four against quarter one it's stabilized, but if you look at quarter one against quarter one it doesn\u2019t look good. So we are not seeing any further deterioration in the market in Russia subsequent quarters. If you look year-over-year, yes there is a difference.", "Garry Ridge", "And some of that comment was just the general market condition \u2013 the general economic condition of Russia, just a little bit \u2013 still a little bit unstable.", "Linda Weiser", "Yeah, okay, it does make sense.", "Garry Ridge", "Because of the dramatic depreciation of the\u2026", "Jay Rembolt", "I could sarcastically say I'll push the random excuse generator here and we'll talk about Asia because we think that the bomb went off in Korea and we'll push another \u2013 the world is full of events and we just got to manage through these events.", "Linda Weiser", "Right, yeah. Okay, well I guess that\u2019s pretty good for me now. Thank you so much for answering all the questions.", "Jay Rembolt", "You're welcome.", "Garry Ridge", "Bye, Linda.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you, good afternoon Garry, good afternoon Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, could you give us some sense on how some of the other non-specialist brand extensions are doing and then how the pipeline is for some of these new products?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, we don\u2019t really have any non-specialist brand extensions other than GT85.", "Liam Burke", "Right.", "Garry Ridge", "Or 3 and 1. And 3 and 1 for example, we've completed the extension of the product range that you'll now see in distribution places like lows. The brand extensions are really coming in specialists. We're just about to ship I think our new specialist spray and stick gel I think that goes into market right now as we speak. There is a couple of specialist lines going in this year, we're still working on the development of specialist motorcycle for the U.S., we expect that later in the year. We've got some other line extensions as specialist plan in Asia Pacific that'll come during the year. So it'll be a progressive thing but other than those 3 and 1s pretty well set now and some work on GT85, there is nothing outside of that. We're really concentrating on the call.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And Jay, CapEx was lower year-over-year. Could you give us a sense as to what the CapEx level will be this year or do you have any additional projects?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yeah, we're in the $6 million to $7 million.", "Liam Burke", "$6 million to $7 million, okay. Thanks, Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Good afternoon, everyone.", "Garry Ridge", "Hello.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "I was just wondering how long it takes before a new hire contributes to the bottom line as you are adding training and so on?", "Garry Ridge", "Wow! What a wide question, I guess it depends where they work. If they're a sales person, they're going to start contributing pretty quickly, and I don\u2019t know \u2013 the thing that we measure is revenue per employee. And we have a target of a $1 million of revenue per employee. We're about 890,000 at the end of last year, you'll see that start to track back to towards our $1 million this year. But our horizon Jay, what's your\u2026", "Jay Rembolt", "Well, the $1 million per employee is kind of our interim target but really look at a $1 million to $1.50 for kind of our horizon target.", "Garry Ridge", "Yeah, as we grow revenue will see that. So I don\u2019t know I could tell you exactly whether it depend where they go, but certainly our revenue per employee ratio is enviable.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Yeah, so there is quite a high number actually. And what I was wondering is that in order to maintain your margin targets, do you get there when an employee is that at $1 million in revenues or does it take longer than that, that\u2019s one point two, they kind of cover all of the cost going into training them and so on?", "Garry Ridge", "Well it depends, if you look at somewhere like China, we've got 53 employees in China with revenue of about $12.5 million in the year. We expect China to eventually be a $100 million revenue, so we'll gain the leverage there but again I think the point is that our revenue per employee at somewhere between $900,000 and a $1 million is something that we're focused for as many years as I've been here.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, thank you, that is helpful. And I was also wondering if \u2013 it looks as though you are growing your direct sales faster than you are growing the distribution sales and I am guessing and I maybe wrong, but I'm guessing that the profitability of your direct sales is higher and you'll have more control. Any thought of going direct in the larger fashion in the areas where you are currently pushing the distribution?", "Garry Ridge", "In fact our distribution business is more profitable than our direct business in some cases. It's not a profitability question, it's a matter of market potential and size. And we converted a number of markets from distributor markets to direct markets where we believe that a higher level of investment and focus will bring growth \u2013 more meaningful growth overtime. We're not planning at the moment to convert any other distributed markets, we are pretty happy with most of our network but we review that every year, but it's not really based on the profitability of the business in the distributor markets, which is very profitable.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, so it is if I understood properly it is more because you can invest and then growth with that particular market faster.", "Garry Ridge", "Correct. For example in China, when we opened our business in China in a direct way seven years or eight years ago, we were doing a couple of million dollars in China. We knew that China long-term would be \u2013 was a good opportunity for us. Now, it would be unreasonable for us to ask a distributor who is doing $2 million in sales to employee 53 people to start to build a business. So we went in and opened the business and then in that period of time we've grown it to about a $12 million business and we'll continue to grow it through the investment of people at the time.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And you are not concerned in China of losing your intellectual property?", "Garry Ridge", "I'm concerned about losing our intellectual property everywhere in the world, we're counterfeited in China but that\u2019s just part of doing business. That\u2019s why we invest rigorously in intellectual property protection. What is counterfeited actually is the trade dress, not the product. So, and we're not just counterfeited in China, we're counterfeited in Russia, we're counterfeited in Eastern Europe, it's an ongoing investment that we've done for many years and it's just \u2013 it's part of the \u2013 the price should pay to be a global brand that people love.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, great. Thank you very much, and I appreciate it.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today's conference call, and ask that you please disconnect your line. Thank you."]}

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt. In addition to the financial information presented on today\u2019s call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release and Form 10-Q for the period ending February 29, 2016.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Wendy. Good day and good afternoon from, believe it or not, a wet and rainy day in San Diego. Today, we reported net sales of $94.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which was a decrease of 3% from Q2 of last fiscal year. Net income for the second quarter was $13.7 million compared to $11.3 million in Q2 last fiscal year, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.94 compared to $0.76 for the same period last fiscal year.", "As we review our results for the second quarter, we will be doing so under the umbrella of our 55/30/25 rule and our strategic initiatives. While global sales continue to be negatively impacted by changing foreign currency exchange rates, our gross margin has increased to over 55% in the second quarter, which has contributed to the record net earnings and diluted earnings per share.", "Before we dive into the sales results, let\u2019s take a moment to review our strategic initiatives as well as our long-term targets. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with the little red top to more places for more people. It will find more uses more frequently. We believe we can grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product to approximately $600 million revenue over the next 10 years. Although global sales of Multi-Use Product were down 4% in this quarter compared to last year, we saw growth of the Multi-Use Product sales in the Americas. The declines we saw in our other trade blocks were primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, unstable market conditions in Russia and the timing of customer orders in the company\u2019s Asian distributor markets. Additionally, our new EZ-REACH product continues to exceed our original assumptions and end user feedback thus far has been positive.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the shield to develop new products and categories within defined geographies and platforms. We believe we can grow WD-40 Specialist to approximately $125 million in revenue over the next 10 years. In the second quarter, sales of WD-40 Specialist were $5.4 million, which represents a 20% increase over the second quarter of last year. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for the WD-40 Specialist product line. However, there will be some volatility in sales along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the launch of new product offerings and the building of new distribution.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from new sources and brands. A great example of how we have executed against this strategic initiative is the small acquisition we made in 2004 of GT85. GT85 is a multipurpose maintenance product sold mainly in the United Kingdom in the bike trade channels. In the last 18 months, we have successfully integrated the brand into our line of products in the United Kingdom. It has been given a refreshed tray dress to appeal to bike enthusiasts and we have expanded the GT85 product line to include a wet loop, a dry loop, a degreaser, a cleaner, a silicon shine and a bike wash. GT85 has become the poster child for what a great acquisition looks like for us.", "Strategic initiative four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our long-term target under this initiative is to grow employee engagement to greater than 95%. At the end of the second quarter, we had a total of 437 tribe members globally. We took our biannual employee engagement survey earlier this year and I am happy to report that our overall global employee engagement score remains the envy of many organizations at 94%. A question I get a lot is how do we maintain our culture in a growing organization? In the last 2 years, we have grown our headcount by over 10% and many of these tribe members are spread out all over the world. We cultivate high-employee engagement by creating a culture based on care, candor, accountability and responsibility guided by our values and nourished by learning. Our employee engagement score is a reflection of the way of life at WD-40. It\u2019s truly about the people at WD-40 Company.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, make it better than it is today. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems and processes, as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection. We measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative by executing against our 50/30/25 business model and by making improvements to the processes and systems, while safeguarding the blue and yellow can with the little red top. We continue to make progress on several initiatives, including transitioning all of the 50 U.S. states to the lower VOC formula we launched in California in fiscal year 2014, focusing on credit category leadership all around the globe and continuing to implement the upgrade of our ERP system in EMEA. That now completes the update on our strategic initiatives.", "So, let\u2019s move on to the more details of our second quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were $94.6 million in the second quarter, down $2.7 million versus last year. In the second quarter, we generated approximately 40% of sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changing foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a significant headwind for us. If you were to remove all of the foreign currency exchange impacts, our consolidated revenue would have been $98 million, up slightly over the second quarter of last year. Consolidated net sales were reduced by about $3 million due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. This is what we refer to as translation related exposure or constant currency. And it impacts reported results in Canada, Australia, China and the EMEA segment. In addition, consolidated net sales were reduced by about $400,000, primarily due to the weakening euro against the pound sterling. This is what we refer to as transaction-related exposure and it only impacts reported results in our EMEA segment.", "Now let\u2019s take a closer look at what is happening in the individual segments. Our second quarter results are really a true reflection of the diversity of our business across geographies, trade channels and economies. We will start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas, which includes the United States, Latin America and Canada increased to $45.5 million in the second quarter, up about 2% from last year. On a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas for the second quarter would have increased to $45.9 million, up 3% compared to prior year. Sales of maintenance products increased about 3% in the Americas, primarily due to higher sales of Multi-Use product in Latin America as a result of higher levels of promotional activities and increased sales of WD-40 Specialist in the U.S. driven primarily by new product introductions. In the U.S. alone, maintenance product sales increased by about 3% driven primarily by the added distribution of WD-40 EZ-REACH and promotional activities.", "Maintenance products sales in Latin America were up 23% in the quarter due to the timing of customer orders and the success of certain promotional activities, particularly those in Mexico and Chile. As a reminder, we sell our products in U.S. dollars in Latin America, so currency does not report our \u2013 impact our reported results in this region. The increases were partially offset by declines in maintenance products sales in Canada, which were down 32% during the quarter. These declines were primarily due to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as lower sales associated with unstable market and economic conditions in Western Canada as a result of suppressed activity in the oil industry. Our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products. We continue to consider our homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows, but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business over time. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas during the second quarter decreased about 4% from last year.", "Let\u2019s jump across the pond now and take a look at EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India decreased to $35.6 million in the second quarter, down about 8% from last year, primarily due to the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange headwinds, as well as continued unstable market conditions in Russia. On a constant currency basis, sales in EMEA would have decreased by $1.2 million or 3% when compared to the prior year period. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations, as well as through marketing distributors. Reported consolidated sales in the EMEA direct markets, which accounted for 67% of the regional sales, increased 1% during the quarter to $23.8 million. It\u2019s also helpful to look at our results in local currencies, in which we conduct sales transactions in our direct markets. In pound sterling based direct markets, sales decreased by 5% in the quarter, primarily due to decreased distribution in the retail channel in the UK. In euro based direct markets, sales increased by 17% in the quarter, primarily due to increased sales of the WD-40 Multi-Use product and WD-40 Specialist.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our EMEA distributor markets, which accounted for 33% of EMEA sales during the second quarter. Distributor market sales decreased 22% in the second quarter to $11.9 million due primarily to a 34% decrease in sales in Russia as a result of unstable market conditions in the region. Although market conditions have begun to stabilize, we experienced significant declines in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year. Now let\u2019s look at Asia-Pac. Consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region, decreased to $13.4 million in the second quarter, down 4% from last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia-Pacific would have been $14.1 million, an increase of 1% compared to last year.", "In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were $3.9 million in the second quarter, down 7% compared to last year. In its functional currency, the Australian dollar, sales were actually up 7% in the quarter. This growth was due to increased distribution and the continued growth of our maintenance products business. In China, net sales remain relatively constant compared to last year at $2.9 million. In its functional currency, the Chinese RMB, sales were up 1% for the quarter. This growth was due to an increased distribution, particularly in southern China and higher levels of sales resulting from promotional activities. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunity in this region, although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and a varying amount of industrial activity. In our Asian distributor markets, sales were $6.5 million in the quarter, down 2% to last year. This decline in sales was driven primarily by the timing of customer orders. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency translation since we sell our products in U.S. dollars in that region.", "So I am going to take a break and I am going to hand it over to Jay who will continue the review of the financials. Thanks Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. First, let\u2019s take a moment to review that 55/30/25 Rule, the long-term horizon targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be at 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales. Finally, the 25 represents EBITDA, if our gross margin is 55% then our cost of business is 30%, our EBITDA will vary close to 25%. First, the 55, in the second quarter our gross margin was 55.4% compared to 52.6% last year. Gross margin was positively impacted by 300 basis points from major input costs and another positive 70 basis point impact from various other items. These gross margin improvements were partially offset by changing foreign currency exchange rates and higher advertising and promotional discounts, which had an adverse impact on our gross margin of about 90 basis points.", "Starting with our major inputs costs, which include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, crude oil is really one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals and falling oil prices had been a net positive for our gross margin. However, as we have seen it\u2019s quite impossible to predict what crude oil prices will be tomorrow or the next year. When the positive our crude oil goes up in the future, we will most likely see some pressure on our gross margin. Although as we have said, our long-term gross margin target of 55% is not contingent upon oil staying at any particular price point. We cannot control the global market dynamics such as the price of crude oil or fluctuating currencies, but we will continue to be focused and deliberate in managing the rest of our business so that we can maintain our gross margin at a level of close to our target of 55% over the long-term.", "Let\u2019s talk briefly about some of those other items that impacted gross margin in the second quarter. Isolated price increases that we implemented in the last 12 months had a net favorable impact of \u2013 on gross margin of 30 basis points. These were implemented in Asia-Pacific in the third quarter of 2015 and EMEA over the last year. Gross margin was also positively impacted by 40 basis points due to sales mix changes and other miscellaneous items. This improvement was primarily driven by sales mix shift in EMEA where a higher percentage of our sales took place in our higher margin direct markets compared to last year. These improvements to gross margin were partially offset by changing foreign currency exchange rates. In the second quarter, foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points. This is because in EMEA, our cost of goods are primarily sourced in pounds sterling, while approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros, 30% in pounds sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars. The euro deterioration against the pound more than offset any benefit from the strengthening U.S. dollar. As a result, revenues in total were worth less in pounds sterling, thus, decreasing our gross margin.", "Higher advertising and promotional discounts also had an unfavorable impact on our gross margin of 70 basis points. The cost of promotional activities such as sales incentive, trade promotions and cash discounts that we give to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales. The timing and magnitude of these activities can cause fluctuation in gross margin period to period.", "Now, a look at the 30, our cost of doing business. In the second quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 35% compared to the 33% last year. In the second quarter, the reported revenue declined as well as increased SG&A expenses negatively affected our cost of doing business percentage. While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence. This includes investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard our blue and yellow can with the little red top. We expect to move closer to our long-term target of 30 over time as revenues grow.", "For the second quarter, 79% of the cost of doing business came from three areas: people costs or the investments we make in our tribe; also, the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion. As a percentage of revenue, our A&P investment was 5.3% in the second quarter and then freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers. Well then, now brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 22% of net sales in the second quarter compared to 18% in the second quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by the improvements to gross margin that I discussed earlier.", "Well, that completes the discussion of our 55/30/25 business model for the current quarter, but now I will discuss a couple of other items worth noting. We recorded foreign currency exchange gains of $1.3 million within our other income and expense in the second quarter. This is compared to $1.5 million in losses last year. The significant change was primarily due to the relative movement in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the fluctuation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet accounts, particularly those associated with our UK subsidiary.", "The provision for income taxes was 28% in the second quarter compared to 29.6% last year. The lower tax rate was driven by increased taxable earnings generated from foreign operations, which are taxed at lower tax rates as well as the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit. Net income for the second quarter was $13.7 million versus $11.3 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $600,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.94 in the quarter compared to $0.76 for the same period last fiscal year. Diluted weighted shares outstanding decreased to 14.4 million shares from 14.7 million shares a year ago.", "Now, a word about our capital allocation. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On March 22, our Board of Directors approved our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 payable April 29 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 15. Based on today\u2019s closing price of $107.04, the annualized dividend yield is 1.6%. During the second quarter, we repurchased a total of 69,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of approximately $7 million under our share repurchase plans. Our latest share repurchase plan became effective March 1, 2015 and it provides authorization to acquire up to $75 million of the company\u2019s outstanding shares through the planned expiration date of August 2016. As of the end of the second quarter, we had $44.2 million remaining under the plan. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2011, the company has repurchased over $200 million in shares.", "So with that, let\u2019s turn to our fiscal 2016 guidance. We strengthened our earnings guidance to take into account today\u2019s lower crude oil prices, but we have also lowered our guidance for net sales. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain close to current levels, net sales growth is projected to be between 2% and 4% or between $385 million and $394 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be around 55%. Advertising and promotional investments are projected to be between 6% and 6.5% of net sales. And net income is projected to be between $49 million and $50 million. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.40 and $3.47 based on an estimated 14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes currency exchange rates and crude oil prices will remain close to current levels for the remainder of the fiscal year. Now, that completes the financial overview.", "I will turn it now back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. Let\u2019s summarize what you heard on the call today from us. You heard that foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind and reduced our net sales results by approximately $3.4 million. You heard that our second quarter results are a true reflection of the diversity of our business across geographies, trade channels and economies. You heard that the Americas segment is performing well and in line with our expectations, with a 3% growth of maintenance products sales in the second quarter. You heard that our second quarter sales for WD-40 Specialist were $5.4 million, which represents a 20% increase over the second quarter of last year. You heard that most of our direct markets in EMEA continue to grow in their local currency transaction currencies. You heard that crude oil prices continue to be a tailwind. You heard that net income and earnings per share both set new records in the second quarter. And you heard that we revised our fiscal year 2016 guidance to reflect our current view of market conditions and the business environment.", "In closing, I would like to share a quote with you from Ralph Marston. Start strong, stay strong and finish strong, while always remembering why you are doing it in the first place. Thank you for joining us today. We would be pleased to now open the conference to your questions. Back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Garry. Good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Liam.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hey, Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, the sales in the Americas were pretty strong, particularly in the U.S., up 3%. Was there any particular strength in the \u2013 I mean, was there any promotional benefit you had or was there anything in the MRO industrial channel that was particularly strong or did you just see the across the board strength?", "Garry Ridge", "There is nothing we would necessarily call out, Liam. I think that business in hardware home improvements is doing reasonably well. We certainly had some benefit from EZ-REACH and of course, Specialist was up across all trading blocks which included the U.S. We launched the new Specialist product, called spray gel in the quarter, which was well received. So I think overall, our development of our maintenance product strategy in the U.S. is meeting our goal at the moment.", "Liam Burke", "So I mean do products introductions or the brand extensions had provided a little less this quarter, I mean is that\u2026?", "Garry Ridge", "Not \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say, given that the total sales of Specialist were only $5.4 million across the globe, but certainly they have delivered incrementally to our business in the U.S.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And Jay, for the first half of the year, the cash flows were down year-over-year, is there anything that you would anticipate you not reaching your free cash flow objective for the full year?", "Jay Rembolt", "Not at this time. We have had a strong second quarter and the timing of the sales in the second quarter pushed our AR up. We also had some increases in our inventories to help facilitate the transition to the new 50 state, a California formula. So some of it\u2019s, I would say, just a timing and event driven.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And on the inventory front, the investment \u2013 the incremental investment you made as you redid your distribution channel, are you through that series of investment?", "Jay Rembolt", "As far as the impact on costs, yes.", "Liam Burke", "Okay, great. Thanks Gary. Thanks Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "About a couple of years ago, we kind of got beyond that.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. Thanks, Jay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Hi. Thanks. So it was raining here today in New York as well.", "Garry Ridge", "Right.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "But anyways, so it was interesting what you said about the impact on your Canadian business of the oil industry downturn, I am just curious would that be something that would appear in some other regions of the world or is that Canada has the biggest exposures, but what about like the U.S., is the oil industry impact there?", "Garry Ridge", "There has been a little, but I think the extent of it in Canada was much larger, in the western regions of Canada. We did see a reasonable impact on our business in supplying the oil industry there that was much more material for the Canadian business than it is to the U.S. business. Jay, do you have a comment on that?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes. I think that if you just look at the Canadian economy in total, they are much more dependent on the natural resources than the U.S. economy at this time.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then you mentioned something in the UK business about, I think losing some distribution or is that in the B2B kind of business, or is that at retail and if you actually lost some distribution, is that a negative impact now for a couple of quarters until we anniversary that affect?", "Garry Ridge", "No, I think it\u2019s just more event driven. We were talking about primarily the UK in pounds in the quarter. It\u2019s not anything that we would be alarmed about. I think we will just see it \u2013 we have about if it\u2019s in the remaining part of the year. So it\u2019s not a trend, it was more of an event driven, but it\u2019s \u2013 we won\u2019t be listed from anybody.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay, got it. And then on the sales, pace in your sales guidance, I mean if you kind of really analyze the FX changes since you last reported, I really think there hasn\u2019t been that many real material changes?", "Garry Ridge", "Correct.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. So the reduction in your guidance is then kind of more just on excluding all the currency impacts you are expecting less growth?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, what we would have hoped is we would have picked up a little from the first quarter. But it\u2019s really the impacts, if you look at where - its Canada and its Russia are the two biggest areas, currency flowing through. So we are expecting to have more volume growth in the third and fourth quarter than we had in the first and second. We just won\u2019t make up a little bit we would have liked to have made up.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And on the topic of Russia, just starting over the comparisons for that piece of your business, I mean I think next quarter, in the third fiscal quarter you start to come up against the easy comparisons?", "Garry Ridge", "Absolutely correct, this quarter was the worst comparison. It dropped off substantially in the third quarter.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right. So I was actually thinking \u2013 I mean I was kind of modeling that, that EMEA distributor market would actually be up a little bit in the third and fourth quarters, is that a reasonable assumption or not?", "Garry Ridge", "We think it should be leveling out. Now, I think the impact is \u2013 we are about to lap the major impact, but Q2 last year we started to see a revival in the business in Russia. And then it just went in the basket again. And it really dropped off in the third quarter. So we would think that it\u2019s going to start to stabilize now.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. So it sounds like maybe flattish rather than up as I...?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes. I would be more comfortable with flattish.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay, got it. And then just in terms of the low petroleum based input costs that we are seeing that\u2019s been helping your gross margins, are you starting to see any kind of pricing come down competitively, are competitors reacting to that and starting to see lower pricing or less ability to price up, I guess?", "Garry Ridge", "It\u2019s also what are we seeing and it\u2019s actually reflected in our results when we talk about the reduction in gross margin due to discounts and allowances. What we are doing is supporting our customers somewhat with promotional events to offset the unpredictable nature of oil. Some others are probably doing that as well, I don\u2019t think we look at that as a competitive threat really, Linda. But we certainly want to make sure that we are doing the right thing and passing any sustainable value through to our end users, but the challenge we continue to have is this oil thing is really hard to manage. So we are running some promotional activities in different markets to support parsing through to the end user, not necessarily to offset any competitor activity.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right, okay. Alright. And then so it sounds like EZ-REACH is going quite well and I think you had said maybe by the end of the fiscal year, it would have pretty full distribution in the U.S., is that still the case?", "Garry Ridge", "We hope so. We are certainly now in a position to be able to supply the whole U.S. market. Initially, our reduced distribution was due to our ability to ramp up automation to make one of the critical components. We are now through that and we are able to get full distribution or supply the market. We will then be looking at our need to take it to some of the other appropriate markets around the world. Australia and Europe were some or some the European countries will be the first ones.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Do you think international sales could occur as early as the first quarter of FY \u201817?", "Garry Ridge", "May be, but more likely the second quarter, I would think.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay.", "Garry Ridge", "They are just \u2013 our Europe \u2013 we are just in the middle of our business planning process right now for fiscal year 2017. So I know a number of markets are looking at their opportunities to include EZ-REACH in their launch plans. Those business planning activities won\u2019t be completed for a few weeks and then they have to be all signed off. So that will be compared against available volumes to make sure that we can meet our promises. So \u2013 but we will be taking EZ-REACH to the appropriate markets around the world in a deliberate and planned manner.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then just in the Asia distributor markets, this come up is mentioned, a couple of times I know there was a transition issue like a year ago or so, is the issues that you keep mentioning there, is that like a macro thing or is it just your execution with distributors?", "Garry Ridge", "It\u2019s just timing. At \u2013 currently, we ship most of the distributor market business for Asia or out of Long Beach in California. Because most distributors buy in large volumes, you can have sales flop around quarter to quarter. We are going to see growth in the Asian distributors in the full year just as we did last year, but it\u2019s just a timing issue. So, it\u2019s nothing we are really overly \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s nothing we are concerned at all about. We are happy with the way the Asian distributor markets are tracking and what you will see as you would realize is not unusual. That\u2019s why you remember that the different events that we talk about, we bring them up, so we make everybody aware of them. But then when you look year-over-year, you see the growth. So, it\u2019s just fewer customers being shipped larger quantities and that can impact recording revenues.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then just finally in terms of the tax rate, I guess I was putting in 29.5 for the next two quarters. It sounds like it\u2019s 28 more of a better estimate for the tax rate?", "Jay Rembolt", "I think 29 is probably closer on an ongoing effective rate.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Okay. And then the other item \u2013 the other income that was related to FX that was pretty big in the quarter, is that able to be projected and it\u2019s probably not easy to project in the next couple of quarters, are you expecting another big amount coming up or?", "Jay Rembolt", "It would really depend on the movement of currencies. And our forecast really envisions currency is remaining stable. Now, that won\u2019t happen. But when they \u2013 it depends on which way they move and how much. So at the moment, we have envisioned it flat. Do I believe that to be the right answer or no, but there is no right answer.", "Linda Bolton-Weiser", "Right. I got it. Okay. Well, thank you very much guys. Take care.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Linda.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

Good day and welcome to our fiscal year 2016 conference call. Today, we reported net sales of $97.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which was an increase of 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $2.8 million on consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. So if we removed all currency related impacts, net sales would have increased nearly 9%.", "Net income was $14.2 million compared to $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 21%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.99 compared to $0.80 for the same period last fiscal year. For the full fiscal year net sales were $380.7 million, which was an increase of 1% from last fiscal year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $11.7 million on consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016. So if we removed all currency related impacts, net sales would have increased by about 4%.", "Net income was $52.6 million in fiscal 2016, reflecting an increase of 17%. Diluted earnings per share for the full year fiscal year were $3.64 compared to $3.04 in the prior fiscal year. For the purpose of this call, after discussing our strategic initiatives, we will be focusing primarily on the financial and operating results for the fourth fiscal quarter. For a complete discussion of our full-year\u2019s results for 2016, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today, or our annual report on form 10-K, which we expect to file with the SEC on Monday, October 24.", "So let\u2019s start with a discussion about strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places, for more people, who will find more uses more frequently. We believe we can grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product to approximately 600 million globally in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025. In the fourth quarter, global sales of Multi-Use Product were up 7% compared to last year, which includes the growth in all three trading blocks.", "We have many exciting things planned for the blue and yellow with a little red top during fiscal 2017. We will begin expanding the distribution of our newest innovation, WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw to other geographies beginning with Australia early in 2017. In EMEA, we will increase the rate of converting European end users from \u2013 to our more innovating \u2013 innovative Smart Straw delivery system.", "Strategic driver number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the power of the Shield to develop new products and categories within identified geographies and platforms. In the fourth quarter, sales of WD-40 Specialist were 6.3 million, bringing Specialist sales to 21.5 million for the fiscal year. This represents a 14% increase in fiscal 2026 compared to last year. We continue to add new category extensions to the Specialist product line in various geographies around the world. In fiscal 2026, we launched WD-40 Specialist Spray & Stay Gel Lubricant, which solves one of our end users biggest pain points by providing no-drip, no-mess lubrication.", "We are currently distributing this new product in all major trade channels in the United States. We have many exciting things planned for WD-40 Specialist in fiscal 2017, including a new line of industrial strength cleaners and degreasers, and a full line of greasers designed to simplify lubrication through superior performance. Building on this success we\u2019ve had in EMEA, WD-40 Specialist Motorbike, the United States is introducing a line of WD-40 Specialist motorcycle products.", "We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist\u2019s product line, and continue to believe we can grow WD-40 Specialist to approximately $125 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025. Still, there will still be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the launch phasing of new products and offerings, and the building of new distribution.", "Strategic initiative number three, broaden product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenues from new sources and brands. Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products like 3-IN-ONE, WD-40 BIKE, GT85 and we\u2019ve made much progress in evolving these three in the last 12 months. In fiscal year 2017, we will launch a new line under the 3-IN-ONE brand in the United States designed for recreational vehicles, which will appeal to the passionate hobbyists who enjoy creating positive lasting memories with their second home on wheels.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our long-term target under this initiative is to our grow employee engagement to greater than 95%. At the end of this fiscal year, we had 445 tribe members globally. In 2006, we made an important decision that we believe will help us reach our long-term employment engagement target. We decided to buy a new building that will house both our corporate and Americas tribe members, and last month we closed \u2013 we did close escrow on our new facility.", "We are currently in the progress or process of renovating the property and we expect to move into our new office in San Diego in July 2017. We expect to make a capital investment of approximately $15 million during fiscal year 2017 for the building. Building our company\u2019s bench strength for future success is a top priority. At WD-40 Company succession planning isn\u2019t just a box that we check. We are weaving a complex tapestry, succession planning is a thoughtful and deliberate process, which ultimately results in a clear leadership roadmap. It is my opinion that the most neglected step when it comes to succession planning is preparing for what happens after the successor is named.", "As a learning and teaching organization, we understand that much support must be provided. To that end, we are making some leadership changes I would like to share with you. Mike Freeman, the President of the Americas will begin to transition to a new role of Chief Strategy Officer. In his role, Mike will continue to report to me and his responsibilities will be to research and understand industry and consumer trends and behaviors that will affect our Company over the next five to seven years.", "During the transition period, one of Mike\u2019s responsibilities will be to mentor his successor, Steve Brass. Steve will be appointed to the new role of Division President of the Americas in December 2016. Steve has been with our Company for 25 years and has served in various roles during that time. In the most recent role, Steve was the commercial director responsible for the oversight of our EMEA direct markets. We are very excited that Steve and his family have moved to San Diego from the UK, and we wish both Steve and Mike the best in their new roles.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, make it better than it is today. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems and processes, as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection.", "We measure ourselves against the operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model, and by making improvements to the processes and systems while still safeguarding the blue and yellow can with the little red top. During the fiscal year, we continued to make progress on several initiatives. These included completing the transition to a lower VOC formula in the United States, making distribution changes in our German market, and nearing the completion of the upgrade of our ERP system in EMEA.", "That completes the update on our strategic initiatives so let\u2019s move on to the details of the fourth quarter results starting with sales. As I mentioned before, consolidated net sales were $97.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% versus last year. As you know, we focus our time, talent, treasure and technology on growing our maintenance products. In the fourth quarter, sales of maintenance products were nearly $87 million, which is an 8% increase from last year. In the fourth quarter, we generated approximately 40% of our sales in currencies other than the U.S.", "Changing foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind for us. If we were to remove all foreign currency exchange rates, our consolidated revenue would have been about $100 million, up nearly 9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Consolidated net sales were reduced by about $5.7 million due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. What is referred to as translational-related exposure, or constant currency, and it impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China and the EMEA segment. This reduction in sales was partially offset by $2.9 million in transaction-related impacts in EMEA due to the strengthening of the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling.", "Now we can take a closer look at what happened into the individual segments during the fourth quarter. We will start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas, which included the United States, Latin America and Canada, increased by 7% to $51.6 million, sales of maintenance products increased by 11% in the Americas primarily due to strong sales in the U.S. and Canada. In U.S. maintenance products sales increased by about 13% due to higher levels of promotional activities for maintenance products and the added distribution of the WD-40 EZ-REACH Flexible Straw.", "In Canada maintenance products sales were up 7% during the quarter driven by a high level of promotional activities for the WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Maintenance products sales in Latin America were flat in the fourth quarter when compared to last year. Our maintenance products do exclude our home care and cleaning products. We continue to consider our home care and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows, but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business over time.", "Sales of our home care and cleaning products in the Americas during the fourth quarter decreased 10% from last year. Now over to EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA, which include Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, increased to $34.6 million in the fourth quarter, up about 4% from last year. If we take both translation and transaction currency impacts into consideration, sales in EMEA would have been $36.8 million, an increase of 11% when compared to the prior year.", "As you know, we sell into EMEA through a combination of both direct operations as well as through marketing distributors. Net sales in our EMEA direct markets, which account for 66% of the region's sales, declined 4% during the quarter to $22.7 million in U.S. dollars. It is also helpful to look at our results in local currencies in which we conduct sales transactions in direct markets. In the United Kingdom, our pound sterling-based direct market, sales decreased only 1% in the fourth quarter. In euro-based markets, sales in euros increased 1% in the fourth quarter.", "Now, turn to our EMEA distributor markets which accounted for 34% of EMEA sales during the quarter, distributor market sales increased 23% in the fourth quarter to $11.9 million, primarily due to improved market conditions in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia. Although market conditions have begun to stabilize in Russia, we would like to remind investors that the political and economic instability in the region makes it difficult for us to predict what level of sales we will have in the future.", "Now on to Asia-Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region increased to $11 million in the fourth quarter up 4% from last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia-Pacific would have been $11.5 million, an increase of about 8% compared to last year. In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.6 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared to last year, in its functional currency the Australian dollar, sales increased 13% in the quarter. The growth was primarily due to a high level of promotional programs in the region and continued growth of our base business.", "In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% compared to last year, in its functional currency the Chinese RMB, sales were up 22% in the quarter. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in promotional activities. We are also excited to be celebrating our tenth anniversary of having opened a direct distribution operation into China. Over the last 10 years we've sold over $100 million worth of maintenance products into China and we continue to believe there's a significant opportunity in the country for many years to come. We remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities in that region although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and the varying of industrial activities.", "In Asian distributor markets net sales were $3.2 million for the quarter, down 18% compared to last year. This decline was primarily due to timing of customer orders and promotional activities. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency translations since we sell our product in U.S. dollars in these markets.", "I will take break now and I will hand over to Jay, and I will ask him them to review the financials in a little more depth. Thanks Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. Good afternoon. Let's start with a discussion about how we performed against our most recently 2016 guidance. We expected our fiscal 2016 net sales to be slightly above 2015, or between $378 million and $383 million. Today we reported fiscal year revenue of $380.7 million, reflecting an increase in sales of about 1% from fiscal year 2015. We expected our gross margin to be above 55%. Well today we reported gross margin of 56.3%. We expected our global advertising and promotional investment be near 6% of net sales and today we reported our A&P of 5.9% of net sales. We had expected net income to be between $49 million and $50 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share of between $3.40 and $3.47 assuming 14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "Today we reported net income of $52.6 million and a diluted EPS of $3.64 based on 14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. Overall, we delivered our full fiscal year results in line with our most recent guidance with the exception of one non-operating item that favorably impacted other income by $2.4 million. And thus increased EPS by approximately $0.12. While foreign currency has negatively impacted our sales results, we reported this $2.4 million of other income from foreign currency gains as a result of the re-measurement of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries.", "Now let's review the 55/30/25 business model. The long-term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be a 55% of net sales, the 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales. Then finally, the 25 represents our resulting EBITDA. First, the 55, our gross margin. In the fourth quarter our gross margin was 57.4% compared to 54.3% last year. Gross margin was positively impacted by 160 basis points from our major input cost changes, 120 basis points from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in EMEA, and 30 basis points from various other items.", "Let's begin with the major input costs, which include our petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans. Crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals and as we have shared with you in the past, it often takes considerable time, approximately 90 to 120 days, for the changes in commodity prices to impact our cost of goods sold. The average cost of crude oil which flowed through our cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of this year was much lower than in the prior year and thus benefiting our gross margin.", "As a reminder, our long-term gross margin target of 55% is not contingent on oil staying at any particular price point. We cannot control the global market dynamics such as the price of crude oil or fluctuating currencies, but we can continue to be focused and deliver in managing the rest of our business so that we maintain gross margin at a level close to our target 55% over the long-term.", "Let's briefly talk about some of the other items impacting gross margin in the fourth quarter. Primarily the changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted our gross margin by 120 basis points. This is because in EMEA our cost of goods are sourced primarily in pound sterling. And approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros, 30% in pound sterling and the remaining 25% in the U.S. dollar. The combined effect of the strength in both the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling caused our revenues in total to be worth more this year in pound sterling, thus improving our gross margin.", "The net effect of sales mix and other miscellaneous costs had a favorable impact in this quarter of about 30 basis points. Now we will look at the 30, or our cost of doing business. In the fourth quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 38% compared to 35% last year. Our goal is to have our cost of doing business to be near 30%. Now period to period, our sales increased by 6%, while our operating expenses increased by 12%, causing a significant increase in our cost of doing business percentage.", "Our SG&A expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter versus $27.4 million in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher employee costs, which increased year over year due to higher employee-earned incentive accruals. Our growth reward program is based on bottom line results, and our incentive plan applies to every member of the tribe at every level in the organization, and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased to reward their individual and collective efforts.", "In addition, we continue to make investments for both the future and in support of our fifth strategic initiative, operational excellence, and this includes investments in new product development, R&D quality assurance, regulatory compliance as well as intellectual property protection to safeguard the blue and yellow can with the little red top. We aspire to move closer to our stretch target of 30 over time as revenues grow.", "For the fourth quarter, 77% of the cost of doing business came from three areas: people costs, or the investments we make in our tribe, and this would include the impact of paying higher earned incentive compensation; the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion, as a percent of net sales our A&P investment was 5.6% in the fourth quarter; and finally, freight costs. The cost to get our products to our customers. That brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 50/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 22% of net sales for the fourth quarter compared to 19% last year. This increase was primarily driven by the improvements to gross margin that I discussed earlier as well as the other income from foreign currency gains.", "In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of $2 million, whereas in the prior year we recorded approximately $100,000 of such gains. That completes our discussion of our 50/30/25 model for the current quarter, now I will discuss a couple of other items worth noting. The provision for income taxes was 26.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 25.7% last year. The higher tax rate was driven primarily by a shift in earnings mix in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior-year quarter, a higher level of taxable earnings was generated in countries with higher tax rates.", "Net income for the fourth quarter was $14.2 million versus $11.7 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.99 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.80 in the same period last year and diluted weighted average shares decreased to 14.3 million shares from 14.5 million shares a year ago.", "Now, a word about capital allocation. Capital allocation at WD-40 is a very thoughtful and deliberate process. We focus both on return of capital to our shareholders and investing for the future. We typically target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales. For fiscal 2017, our capital expenditures will exceed this percentage to accommodate the purchase of our new San Diego facility that Garry discussed earlier.", "We understand the importance of regular dividends to our stockholders and we targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% of net income and have increased dividends in each of the last five years. On October 11, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 a share payable October 31 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 21. Based on today's closing price of $106.42, the annualized dividend yield is 1.6%.", "Next, we look at opportunities to invest for future growth. This can be either internal growth such as market expansion and new product introductions or by acquisition. Return on invested capital is a guiding principle for us and we evaluate opportunities based on the highest expected returns. I'm pleased to share with you that for fiscal 2016, our total return on invested capital was an exceptional 33%. After that we look to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases.", "During the fourth quarter, we acquired approximately 65,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $7.4 million, bringing total purchases under the $75 million stock purchase plan, which had been approved by our board of directors in October 2014, to approximately 503,000 shares at a total cost of $47.8 million. This plan expired on October 31, 2016. In order for the Company to continue our share repurchase activities the board of directors approved a new share buyback plan on June 21, 2016. This new plan became effective September 1. Under the new plan, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $75 million of outstanding shares through August 31 of 2018.", "So with that, let's turn to fiscal 2017 guidance. Net sales growth is projected to be between 4% and 6%, with net sales expected to be between $395 million and $404 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 56%. Advertising and promotional investment is expected to be around our 6% level, and net income is projected to be between $51.3 million and $52.3 million. Diluted earnings per share will be expected to range between $3.64 and $3.71 based on an estimated 14.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "Our sales projections for 2017 reflect the recent and significant deterioration of the pound sterling. The foreign currency exchange rates for the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar has recently declined by approximately 15% from the average rates we experienced last year. This guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates and crude oil prices will remain close to the current levels for fiscal 2017. In addition the guidance does not assume any significant impact in other income from future balance sheet re-measurements as we experienced in 2016.", "That completes the financial overview, and I will turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Jay. To sum up, in summary what did you hear from us on this call? You heard that foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind, and they reduced our net sales by about $12 million for the fiscal year. And on the flip side, we had a non-operating income windfall which resulted in foreign currency gains of about $0.12 per share. You heard that for the full fiscal year we achieved EPS of $3.64 which would have been $3.52 excluding the $0.12 windfall, which is still a record and $0.05 above the top-end guidance of our most recent guidance. You heard that global sales of the blue and yellow can with a little red top grew 7% this quarter. You heard that global sales of WD-40 Specialist were $21.5 million in fiscal 2016 representing 14% increase over last year.", "You heard that the Americas segment is performing well with an 8% growth in sales this quarter. You heard that we will be transitioning Mike Freeman into a new role of Chief Strategy Officer and promoting Steve Brass into the role of Division President of the Americas, and you heard that we met or exceeded all of our most current fiscal year 2016 guidance.", "In closing, I would like to share a quote with you from someone I consider a kindred spirit, optimist and best selling author, Simon Finnick: Imagine a world where nearly everyone wakes up each day inspired to go to work, feels safe while we're there, and returns home at the end of the day fulfilled by the work they do, feeling they've made a contribution to something greater than themselves. This is the world we envision.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll turn back to the operator and be happy to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Garry Ridge", "Hi, Daniel.", "Daniel Rizzo", "How are you? Can you tell me what the operating income is for the different regions do you break that out before the 10-K is distributed?", "Garry Ridge", "We have not.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then you\u2019ve indicated that the easy use spray was kind of a strong driver in the Americas or particularly in North America. I was wondering if you breaking out at this point with the percentage of sales of this what that\u2019s really contributing to the overall growth.", "Garry Ridge", "No, we haven\u2019t broken it out as an individual product line but we are very happy with its origin \u2013 initial launch and as we shared will be taking it out to a more global geographies over the next year, in particular we\u2019ll start in Australia, we\u2019re already in Canada and moving into Latin America and hopefully EMEA later on in the end of next year.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay, and that I'm sorry, you indicated there was an operating income windfall of what $0.12 per share in the quarter. Can you just go over what you said I missed what you say that came from exactly, I know it has something to do with FX but what exactly was it?", "Garry Ridge", "Well Jay, I\u2019ll do that. Yes it from the revaluation the re-measurement of our balance sheets, our foreign subsidiary balance sheets that are their functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar and as we remeasure them for reporting them in consolidation they generated losses.", "Jay Rembolt", "Or excuse me gains.", "Daniel Rizzo", "And it was particularly caused by the Brexit exit and the massive reduction in the value of the pound against the U.S. dollar.", "Jay Rembolt", "So it was \u2013 because of Brexit.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay, all right thank you for clarification.", "Jay Rembolt", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of William Burks from Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question.", "William Burks", "Thank you. Good afternoon Gary, good afternoon Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Hey William.", "Garry Ridge", "Hey William.", "William Burks", "Garry, you guided to 56% gross margin which is a little about above your longer term target presuming that oil prices or your input cost on oil remains flat. Where do you see the pickup in terms of margin? Gross margin?", "Garry Ridge", "Our plan for next year assumes oil will be in the $45 to $60 range. If it stays there in my are a member William, part of our gross margin enhancement strategy apart from some of the \u2013 you got from oil was developing products particularly in Specialist line and particularly also in areas of immunization like EZ-REACH and et cetera that would be margin positive. As the mix changes around that, you will see some of that embeds into place. We'd also see that Europe we have as Europe continues to stabilize, margins there again hold up. We feel reasonably comfortable that this margin number is pretty good, Jay.", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, that\u2019s right Garry. In addition there's also an impact from currency, the current weekend sterling against the pound and the dollar, generates a higher gross margin in Europe, in our current period. And as we project forward if that stays at the same rates we would see that benefit accruing as well.", "Garry Ridge", "You noted that we got 120 basis points benefit in the quarter because of that.", "William Burks", "Right. Garry you talked a lot about currency translations. You didn't talk about other headwinds in the business that would \u2013 revenue growth. Can you talk about anything that you are worried about in terms of slowing your plan and growing the revenue?", "Garry Ridge", "William we are very comfortable with the two major strategic drivers we have. Year-over-year if you broke out the impact of currency we grew our maintenance products revenue globally by about 5%. So our whole business is in we believe some \u2013 in very good condition. As long as we stay focused on strategic driver number one and number two which is grow the blue and yellow can more people more prices more uses more often and then deliberately working on leveraging the shield or specialist will be happy with that.", "We've also done some great work on 3-IN-ONE, you may have heard we are releasing a new range of recreational vehicle maintenance OpEx under the 3-IN-ONE brandthat we already have gain distribution on those it is a major distribution channels. So the business is in good shape. What could blow us off course? We still don't know what the recoveries going to be like in Eastern Europe. We had a bit of a comeback in Russia it seems to settle down but who knows. But we wake up every day knowing we live in this volatile uncertain complex world all of ambiguity but I think we've proven over the past years that in calm seas we sail okay and in rough seas we kind of do okay as well.", "So is a lot of confidence around our business right now, the tribe are in great shape and employee engagement is extremely high. They are passionate and up is driven so this is a great time to be at WD-40 company.", "William Burks", "Great, thanks Garry, thanks Jay.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt. In addition to the financial information presented on today\u2019s call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release and Form 10-Q for the period ending November 30th, 2016.

The Company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Wendy. Good day and thanks for joining us for today's conference call. Today, we reported net sales of 89.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, which is a decrease of 4% from the first quarter of last year. Net income for the first quarter was 11.8 million compared to 12.1 million in the first quarter of last fiscal year, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.82 compared to $0.83 for the same period last year.", "Now let\u2019s start with a discussion about our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with the little red top to more places, for more people, who will find more uses more frequently. We believe we can grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product to approximately 600 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025.", "In the first quarter, global sales of Multi-Use Product were down 7% compared to the first quarter of last year. Despite the choppy start to the year we have many exciting things planned for the blue and yellow can with a little red top during fiscal year 2017. We will begin expanding distribution of our newest innovation, WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw to other geographies beginning with Australia later this month. In EMEA, we will increase the rate of converting European end users to our more innovative Smart Straw delivery system.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist line. Once we\u2019ve build our brand equity and established the power of the Shield in a particular geography we can leverage that brand recognition to develop new product lines like WD-40 Specialist. We believe we can grow WD-40 Specialist to approximately a 125 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2025.", "In the first quarter, sales of WD-40 Specialist were 5.8 million, which represents a 36% increase over the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter we're excited to have launched our new line of Specialist greasers in the United States which is the line of grease products designed to prevent rust and corrosion and to protect across extreme conditions. We're optimistic about the long term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist product line, however there will be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution and various other factors that come with building a new product line.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of the WD-40 Company to derive revenue from new sources and brands. We continue to expand the product offering within our 3-IN-ONE, GT85, as well as WD-40 BIKE.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop and retain talented tribe members. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 445 tribe members globally. Our long term target under this initiative is to grow employee engagement to greater than 95%. We're learning and teaching organization and one of the unique internal programs which captures this spirit is called Tribology University. The goal of this global program is to educate our tribe members so they become the indispensable go-to partners for product knowledge and end user insights. Tribology University continues to evolve and grow and our tribe and I am excited about the future of the program.", "Strategic initiative number five is Operational Excellence. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems and processes, as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property potential. We are excited to share that we have finally completed the upgrade of that ERP system in EMEA. I would like to thank all the tribe members that helped make this transaction a successful one.", "That completes the strategic initiatives updates and so let's move on to the details of our first quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were 89.2 million in the first quarter down to 3.3 million versus last year. In the first quarter we generated approximately 40% of sales in currencies other than U.S. dollar and changing foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind for us. Translation of our foreign subsidiaries results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact on sales.", "On a constant currency basis total net sales would have been 95.1 million an increase of 3% compared to last year. This is because our net sales were reduced by about 5.9 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. This is what we refer to as translational related exposure and it impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China and even EMEA segment. However if we take a close look we see that this reduction in sales was significantly offset by about 4.2 million of translation related impacts in EMEA due to the strengthening of the Euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling.", "So net-net, if we remove all foreign currency exchange impacts our consolidated revenue would have been around about 90.9 million, down 2% compared to the first quarter of last year. Now let's take a closer look at what's happening in the individual segments.", "We start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas which includes the United States, Latin America and Canada decreased to 42.8 million in the first quarter down about 4% from last year. Sales of maintenance products decreased by 3% in the Americas, primarily due to the lower sales of the Multi-Use Product in United States and Latin America. Maintenance product sales in the United States were down 3% during the first quarter due to the timing of customer orders and promotional activities associated with the WD-40 Multi-Use Product.", "This decline is primarily due to the fact that in the comparable period last year sales were higher than normal due to the initial launch and distribution of WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw in the United States. This decrease in sales was partially offset by increased sales of WD-40 specialist.", "Maintenance product sales in Latin America were down 6% in the quarter primarily due to the uncertain business conditions in Mexico as a result of the current political climate in the region. As a reminder our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products, we continue to consider our homecare and cleaning products particularly those in the U.S. as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows, but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business overtime. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 5% in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year.", "Let\u2019s jump across the pond to EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India decreased to 30.3 million in the first quarter down 6% from last year. EMEA is reported results in the first quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange headwinds as well as the timing of customer orders in Russia. On a constant currency basis sales in EMEA increased 4.2 million or 13% compared to last year. We sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors.", "Reported consolidated sales of EMEA direct markets, which accounted for 66% of the region's sales, were up 3% for the quarter at $20 million in U.S. dollars. However, it is also helpful to look at our results in local currencies in which we conduct sales transactions in our direct markets. In the United Kingdom, our pound sterling direct market, total sales increased 7% in the first quarter. In our Europe-based direct markets, sales in Euros increased by 10% in the first quarter.", "Now, let's turn to our EMEA distributor markets which accounted for 34% of EMEA sales during the quarter. Distributor markets decreased 19% in the first quarter, primarily due to a 36% decreased in sales in Russia. Although market conditions have begun to stabilize in Russia, our results reflect the steps of our marketing distributors have taken to normalize their inventory levels to meet the current market needs. We would like to remind our investors that political and economic instability in the region makes it difficult for us to predict what level of sales we will have in this market in the near future.", "Now let's go across to Asia-Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region increased to $16.1 million in the first quarter, up about 1% from last year. In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.4 million in the first quarter, up 16% compared to last year, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on these results. In its functional currency the Australian dollar, sales were up 8% for the quarter. The growth was due to increased distribution and higher sales resulting from successful promotional programs as well as the continued growth of our base business.", "In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were $3.2 million in the first quarter, up 7% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on these results. In its functional currency the Chinese RMB, sales were up 14% in the quarter. The growth in the region was due to new distribution and increased promotional activities. We are in a new phase of building distribution in China. We recently added 121 new accounts in China in an effort to make WD-40 Multi-Use Product even easy to buy. We expect to add more distribution in China later this fiscal year. We continue to remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in this region, although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patterns and the varying industrial activities.", "In our Asian distributor markets net sales were $8.6 million for the quarter, down 8% compared to last year. The decline in sales was driven primarily by a lower level of promotional activity and the timing of customer orders. This decline is partially due to the fact that in the comparable period last year customers were buying product in advance of a price increase that took price at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency, since we still have products in U.S. dollars in that region.", "Now over to Jay, who will continue the review of the financials. ", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. First, let's review the 55/30/25 business model. The long-term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55% of sales, the 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales and then finally the 25 represents EBITDA.", "First the 55 or our gross margin, in the first quarter our gross margin was 57.2% compared to the 55.6% in the first quarter of last year. For the first time in several quarters\u2019 net changes in the cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans did not have an overall impact on our gross margin. Although the net changes in the cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals did not have an impact, we did experience a net positive impacts on gross margin from costs in our Americas and Asia Pacific segments. However these were fully offset by unfavorable net impacts in our EMEA segment.", "While the cost of petroleum specialty chemicals for our EMEA segments are sourced in pound sterling, the underlying inputs are denominated in U.S. dollar and as a result of the strengthening of U.S. dollar against the sterling, we saw a significant increase in the cost of goods in pound sterling.", "Just changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on our gross margin as well. This is because in EMEA our cost of goods are primarily sourced in pound sterling while approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in Euros, 30% in pound sterling and the remaining 25% in U.S. dollars, the combined effect of the strengthening of both the Euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling caused revenues in total to be worth more in pound sterling thus improving our gross margin. Also positively impacting our gross margin by 50 basis points this quarter were sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs, primarily due to a larger portion of our sales in EMEA being made up of higher margin maintenance products.", "Gross margin also was positively impacted by 10 basis points due to sales price increases which were implemented in EMEA over the last 12 months. These improvements of gross margin were partially offset by higher warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in the Americas which had an unfavorable impact on our gross margin of 30 basis points. Additionally advertising, promotional and other discount that we give to our customers increased compared to last year and had a negative impact on gross margin of another 30 basis points.", "Well now I\u2019ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the first quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 37% compared to 35% last year. Revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving our long term 30% target. In the first quarter, our revenue declined as well as increased SG&A expenses negatively affected our cost of doing business percentage. SG&A increased 4% compared to last year which primarily attributed to higher employee related cost. Associated with higher stock base compensation expense due to the timing expenses associated with certain equity awards granted during the first quarter.", "While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative, Operational Excellence. This will include investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard the blue and yellow can with the little red top. We expect to move closer to our long term target of 30 overtime as revenues grow. For the first quarter 75% of the cost of doing business came from just three areas, people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion, as a percentage of sales our A&P investments was 5.4% in the first quarter. And then finally freight costs, the costs to get our products to our customers.", "And that brings us to EBITDA the very last of our 50/30/25 measures, EBITDA was 21% of net sales for the first quarter compared to 20% for the first quarter last year. Now that completes the discussion of our 55/30/25 business model for the current quarter, I'll now discuss a couple of other items worth noting. The provision for income tax was 28.3% in the first quarter compared to 28.5% last year. The slight decrease was driven by increased taxable earnings generated from foreign operations which are taxed at a lower rate.", "Net income for the first quarter was $11.8 million versus 12.1 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of about $1.1 million on the translations of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis net income would have increased by $800,000 compared to last year. Our diluted earnings per common share were $0.82 in the first quarter compared to $0.83 for the same period last fiscal year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.2 million shares from the 14.5 million shares a year ago. Now a word about capital allocation, our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing for long term growth as well as providing strong return to our shareholders.", "We target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales, and as we previously discussed in addition to our maintenance CapEx in fiscal 2017 we anticipate making a onetime investment of approximately $15 million to buy and renovate a new office building to house our San Diego based tribe members. In the first quarter we closed escrow on our property and invested 10.7 million on a building in the San Diego neighborhood of Scripps Ranch. The tribe is very excited to relocate to the new building sometime this summer and we\u2019ll be completing the renovation throughout the next couple of months. In addition, we continue to return capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases.", "On December 13th 2016 our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share, reflecting an increase of 17% over the previous quarter's dividend at $0.42 a share. With this rise we've increased our dividend for seven consecutive years for a total increase of 96% over that time period and based on today's closing price of a 117.30 the annualized dividend yield is 1.67%.", "Now during the first quarter we repurchased nearly 113,000 shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $12.2 million under our current $75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the Board in June of 2016. At the end of the first fiscal quarter we had $62.8 million remaining under the plan.", "So, with that let's turn to our 2017 guidance. We're reaffirming the guidance we gave in October. Net sales growth is projected to be between 4% and 6% with net sales expected to be between $395 million and $404 million. Gross margin for the full fiscal year is expected to be near the 56%. And advertising and promotion investment is projected to be around 6% of sales. Net income is projected to be between $51.3 million and $52.3 million, and diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.64 and $3.71 based on an estimated 14.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "As a reminder this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes foreign currency exchange rates and crude oil prices will remain close to current levels for the duration of fiscal 2017.", "And that completes the financial overview. Now I'll turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Jay. So, let's sum up of what you heard on this call today. You heard that foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind, and on the current constant currency basis reduced our net sales by about 5.9 million. And additionally you heard that that reduction in sales was significantly offset by 4.2 million in transaction related impacts in EMEA due to the strengthening of the Euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound.", "You heard that the global sales of WD-40 Specialist were 5.8 million in the quarter representing a 36% increase compared to last year. You heard that our EMEA direct markets are performing very well. You heard that our Australian market is performing well with 8% growth in functional currency, the Australian dollar. You heard that in China we recently added a 121 new accounts in an effort to make WD-40 Multi-Use Product even easy to buy. You heard that we increased our dividend 17% last month and we've been increasing that dividend for seven consecutive years resulting in a 96% increase over that period of time. You heard that we\u2019ve reaffirmed our fiscal year 2017 guidance.", "In closing I'd like to share a quote from a British author, Neil Gaiman. I hope that in this year to come you make mistakes because if you're making mistakes then you're making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself and you're going to change the world.", "Thank you for joining us on the call today. We'd be more than pleased to now open the conference call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, through the balance of the year do you have any major promotional activities scheduled or is it just going to be the usual ones that you have planned in the past?", "Garry Ridge", "Nothing outside of what our stated plan was, which include a number of different promotions with a number of different customers in a number of different geographies, Liam.", "Liam Burke", "And on the Specialist side you mentioned that you introduced a grease product into the Americas. How does the pipeline on some of these -- some of those types of products of Specialist look?", "Garry Ridge", "We will be releasing out degrees of range later in the year and we now have distribution of that grease lines through Home Depot. If you\u2019d like to go see it, you can go see it there. We\u2019ll be progressively rolling that out. But the greases and our new degrees of line [ph] are the two biggest Specialist launches this year with the continuation of course of added distribution in the U.S. of our WD-40 Specialist spray and stick gel and then a number of other Specialist products in selected geographies around the world. You noted that Specialist grew 36% in the first quarter, so we\u2019re pretty happy with our trajectory on that at this time.", "Liam Burke", "Super. And then just quickly on China, you mentioned the 121 new accounts, I know you have a strong long term outlook for China, does these new accounts accelerate your expectations there or is it pretty much on plan?", "Garry Ridge", "I think what it will do is, it was a planned move, our initial move in China was to overtime build distribution to match consumption. Then as we continue to build consumption we can now add new distribution which eliminates the fear of actually demotivating the current distributers. So for 10 years now we have been building to the business that\u2019s now at a run rate of several as you know million dollars having 15 million. So we are in the next year going to start to actually push out the distribution to now fill the gaps that we think of there. We will do another distribution drive and add more accounts again probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "So I just wanted to make sure I understood what you said about the petroleum based input cost, I think you said overall it was neutral effect on gross margin. But did you say it was positive in some regions and negative in others. Can you just repeat that?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. What we had in the Americas and Asia Pacific is we actually continue to get a net benefit. But when we look to the impact in Europe and EMEA what we saw was their cost of goods were rising for these types of products the input cost associated with the petroleum base products. So that was primarily due to the fact that the sterling has weakened and so they have been seeing kind of an inflation in their cost base.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, so you are saying there is some sort of a currency effect on the actual input cost?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, exactly. Right. While the cost of dollars are the same because of the change in dollar and sterling their sterling acquisition of these inputs are much higher than they were a year ago.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay. So and can you just tell me what was the quantification of the other effect, the FX effect in the EMEA region that\u2019s a separate number, what was that in the quarter?", "Jay Rembolt", "It was the 160 basis points.", "Garry Ridge", "It's fairly significant, let me quickly flip to that. 160 basis points.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, and I seem to recall that's a little more positive even than it was last quarter which makes sense, but my read of things, it actually will get less of a positive going forward after this, is that a correct projection of that sort of --?", "Jay Rembolt", "Well as long as currency stays the same it would, but we don\u2019t really know what's going to happen with currencies.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Right, yes I meant if the British pound were to stay where it was.", "Garry Ridge", "Right. Yes.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, alright. So I mean there is lot of puts and takes obviously than in the gross margin, but I mean I guess I was originally projecting or thinking maybe the gross margin would start to be down year-over-year in the third quarter, is that something that's accurate or might we even see gross margin decline in the second quarter year-over-year. I know you don\u2019t want to get into quarterly guidance, but maybe you could help us understand how the pieces move?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, I think what we've seen is, we're seeing gradual increase in the price of oil and as that gets into our supply chain and then gets into our inventories and into the customer base then we\u2019ll start seeing that increase because of petroleum based input cost. The timing of that what we see as if -- we say about a 120 days, sometimes we see that comes though earlier, sometimes in the case of the kind of the recent declines over the last year or so we've seen that kind of lag quite a bit further than that, as we get the benefits. Now when it comes against us, we tend to see that quicker.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, thank you that's helpful. So would you still say that your planning range, are you still just kind of thinking and your planning range for guidance is $45 to $60 roughly per barrel of oil?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, that's what was in that planning range.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, and the -- can I just say on the sales performance, granted it's hard to project quarter-by-quarter for you guys and sometimes it's strong against strong and weak against weak, but you did have your weak -- your easiest comparison in this quarter, so I was relatively optimistic. I guess the Russia piece was a lot weaker, but how can we have confidence that you are going to come through with stronger growth when the comps get harder in the second half?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, let's talk about the business without all of this static and noise for a minute, Linda, because that's really hard to look at. But I'm looking at a sheet of paper in front of me that lists all of our major geographies and it has green arrows and red arrows on it in relation to transactional currency sales. And if I look firstly in the United States, we had a softer first quarter in the U.S. versus last first quarter and we know why. I've often said that we don\u2019t mix well with Barbie dolls and Barbeque sets at Christmas. Last Christmas, we had a compelling reason to have that floor space, we launched Easy Reach Flexible straw and we got it. So that last first quarter last year had that in it.", "In Latin America, we've got a whole mix going on with the political climate in Mexico which is causing the business climate down there to be uncertain.", "So for the rest of the year, and then in Canada we\u2019re up about 2% in our transaction currency for the year. So the main market which the U.S. is we can see in quarters two, three and four significant opportunities that have revenue growth because of programs, promotions and activities that were going on. So our big mark at the U.S., we are going to see that growth. And we\u2019ve got a little wash in this quarter.", "In EMEA, when I look down this list, in transactional currencies, we\u2019re growing 7% in pounds in the UK, in Benelux 17, in France 9 in Euros, in Iberia 15, in Italy 18, across the whole EMEA market in transaction currencies we grew 10%. Unfortunately when it moves across and it goes through the two currency impacts it looks ugly like it does now. But from where we sit around looking at the strategic growth of our business and having what I call emotional resilience to the fact that the strategy is being executed on we feel fine.", "Russia, we know what happen. Our marketing distributed areas is normalizing inventories, in fact in market styles are better than they were before. And then if I get to Asia Pacific, in transactional currency, Australia is up 8, China is up 14, the distributor Markets were down, we understand why.", "So again, we can't manage this business quarter-to-quarter in normal time and we won't. And secondly, there is so much static and noise in this at the movement, the price we pay for being global, but thank god we are global because it gives us the hedge against one and then to another. So we are comfortable with the guidance we have given. We can see the business in the future. We are comfortable with our long term projections. The tribe are executing, we\u2019ve got great growth in specialist, emotional resilience is what it\u2019s about, steady as she goes, the strategy is strong and we will work through it as we have in the past.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay thanks Garry, I appreciate that. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo", "You mentioned increasing distribution in Asia, I was just wondering if I'm thinking about it rightly when would you shift to maybe doing direct sales in that region versus like as it's kind of progressing in EMEA and obviously in the U.S., I mean is there a timeframe in the future where we kind of do like a transition to doing to more of a direct model?", "Garry Ridge", "No, what I said Daniel is we are increasing distribution in China, and China is already a direct market and we increased distribution by adding 121 new accounts in China. At this time, we have no plan on converting any other marketing distributors in Asia to direct markets. Our only direct markets in Asia are Australia and China.", "Daniel Rizzo", "All right. Thank you for clarification. And then with the easy straw you said, I mean it was down year-over-year just because of the promotional activity in the initial launch last year. Is that something that kind of ticked into the next quarter, or is it just something just for this quarter and we\u2019ll figure out as we go forward?", "Garry Ridge", "It was all in the first quarter of last quarter. That was the major launch. That was when we took floor space in most of the major home improvement and Big Box hardware store in the United State, easy reach flexible store is doing well, we just had that big selling in the first quarter of last year.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay, thanks. And then finally, I think you mentioned in the press release something about the stocking -- inventory destocking in Europe being kind of an issue in the quarter, but I didn't know if you followed up with that on the Conference Call here, so I was just wondering if that's something that's going to be something that maintains monitoring for the next couple of quarters as well?", "Garry Ridge", "What I said was in Russia only, our Marketing distributer in Russia is normalizing their inventory. Over the past 18 months or so Russia has been a basket case as we all know and we went through a period of time of very severe sales declines in market, our distributor had stock, we now feel that that has started to normalize, so we do know that distributor does have a confidence of what the forward looking output in the market is, which is actually output in the market from our distributor at the moment, is up on last year. So what that was doing is basically balancing their stock which means they bought less from us for a period, we should see that normalize as we enter this quarter and the next two quarters.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Alright, again thank you for the clarification.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Daniel.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley, please proceed with your question.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Hi again, so you know I was reviewing, you have so many initiatives for growth, I am reviewing the list of things you had talked about in the last call and can you just mention, are you still planning and did it launch yet, the expansion into the U.S. of the motorbike line and then secondly, the three-in-one recreational vehicle line, when does that launch?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, the three-in-one recreational vehicle line, we\u2019ve started our initial distribution of that, you should see it, if it\u2019s not in some stores it should start to be soon. I can't remember exactly when and motorcycle has not yet gone into distribution. It will but we're waiting for shelf slotting in a major customer. We expect that to come soon.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Linda.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions, we thank you for participating on today's conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}

[Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.

Good day everyone and thanks for joining us for today's conference call. Today we reported net sales of 96.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which was an increase of 2% from the second quarter of last fiscal year. Additionally we reported operating income of 18.9 million which was an increase of 5% from the second quarter of last fiscal year. Although we do not normally discuss operating income on these calls, we thought it was worth mentioning because there are some non-operating items which are distorting our net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter. ", "Net income for the second quarter was 12.4 million compared to 13.7 million in the second quarter of last fiscal year, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. Our net income was negatively impacted as a result of fluctuations in some non-operating currency related items period-over-period as well as an adjustment that was rerecorded to our income tax expense in the second quarter of this year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.87 compared to $0.94 for the same period last fiscal year. ", "Now let's start with a discussion about our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow WD-40 Multi-Use product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people who will find more uses more frequently. We believe we can grow WD-40 Multi-Use product to approximately 600 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025. In the second quarter global sales of multiuse products were up 4% driven by increased product sales in all three trading blocks. In addition WD-40 EZ-REACH Flexible Straw continues to perform well in the U.S. and we have just launched this product offering in Australia in the second quarter. ", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow WD-40 Specialist product line. Once we build our brand equity and established the power of the shield in a particular geography we can leverage the brand recognition to develop new product lines like WD-40 Specialist. We believe we can grow WD-40 Specialist to approximately 125 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2025. ", "In the second quarter sales of WD-40 Specialist was 5.5 million which represents a 1% increase over the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date global sales of WD-40 Specialist was up 17%. We continue to launch new Specialist categories in markets around the world although each market, country, and segment experiences different short-term trends relating to the sales of WD-40 Specialist product line due to the timing of promotions in the building of distribution. We continue to believe that WD-40 Specialist will be a significant revenue and earnings growth engine for many years to come.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product and revenue base. [Indiscernible] under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of the WD-40 company to derive revenue from new sources and brands. We continue to expand the product offerings within our 3-IN-ONE, GT85 brands as well as WD-40 BIKE. WD-40 BIKE continues to gain traction and global sales of the product line increased 40% in the second quarter with particular strength in EMEA where we've experienced solid growth for WD-40 BIKE. We see a lot of opportunity with these maintenance products. ", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop, and obtain outstanding tribe members. [Indiscernible] under this initiative is to attract, develop, and retain talented tribe members. At the end of the second quarter we had a total of 445 tribe members globally. Our long-term target under this initiative is to grow employment and employee engagement to greater than 95%. In support of this objective, early this fiscal year we completed the acquisition of a new building that will house our WD-40 San Diego based tribe members. We are currently in the process of renovating the property and expect to make a total investment of approximately 18.5 million in this facility. This includes 10.7 million for our recent purchase of the land and building and the remaining cost being associated with building improvements as well as the purchase of new furniture, fixtures, and IT equipment. ", "This dovetails nicely into strategic initiative number five operation excellence. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems, and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection. Part of the investment in the new facility is being made on information technology infrastructure equipment which will enhance our ability to operate more effectively as a tribe. We look forward to providing you updates on these initiatives throughout the remainder of this year. ", "That completes the update on the strategic initiatives, so let's move on to the details of the second quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were 96.5 million in the quarter up 2 million versus last year. If we were to remove all foreign currency exchange impacts, our consolidated revenue would have been about 98.6 million up 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. This 2.1 million difference is due to the fact that in the second quarter we generated approximately 40% of our sales in currencies other than U.S. dollar and changes in foreign currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our consolidated results. Translation of our foreign subsidiary results from the functional currencies to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis total net sales would have been 102.9 million, an increase of 9% compared to the last year.", "In the second quarter our net sales were reduced by about 6.4 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. That is what we refer to as translation related exposures and it impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China, and the EMEA segment. However due to the changing foreign currency exchange rate our consolidated net sales were actually improved this quarter by 4.3 million due to transaction related impacts. This currency exposure only impacts reported results in EMEA segment and was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling.", "Now let's take a closer look at what's happening in the individual segments. We will start with the Americas, consolidated net sales in the Americas which includes the United States, Latin America, and Canada decreased to 45.1 million in the second quarter, down about 1% from last year. Sales of maintenance products in the Americas increased just over 1% in the second quarter primarily due to a 25% increase in sales of maintenance products in Canada. This quarter's results in this region can be linked to some of the successful promotional programs and the improving market and economic conditions and we're very pleased to see this improvement in our Canadian market. We believe that we've reached a turning point in Canada and that this market will continue to see growth in the coming quarters. ", "Maintenance product sales in Latin America were down 3% in the quarter primarily due to the continuing uncertain business conditions in Mexico as a result of the current political climate. Though maintenance products sales in the United States were relatively flat in the second quarter, our WD-40 EZ-REACH Flexible Straw product continues to make good traction and favorably impacted sales in the U.S. during the quarter due to added distribution. As a reminder our maintenance products exclude our home care and cleaning products. We continue to consider our home care and cleaning products particularly those in the U.S. as harvest trends that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows but I generally expect it to become a small part of the business over time. Sales of our home care and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 10% in the second quarter compared to the same period of last year. ", "Now on to EMA, consolidated net sales in EMEA which include Europe, Middle East, Africa, and India increased to 36.2 million in the second quarter, up 2% from last year. EMEA's reported results in the second quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis sales in EMEA would have been 42.6 million, an increase of 7 million or 20% compared to the last year. However, these constant currency numbers do not kind of complete currency pictures since we experienced favorable impact of 4.3 million from the transaction related exposures in the second quarter. We think the best way to give you a complete look at how market is performing is to look at our results in local currencies which we conduct sales transactions in our direct markets in EMEA.", "Although the overall sales in direct markets decreased 2% in U.S. dollars in the second quarter, sales in our Europe based direct markets increased by 7% driven by growth in continental Europe mainly due to the expanded distribution. These sales increases were more than offset by a sales decrease in our pound sterling base market of 5% primarily due to decreased sales of the 1001 brand as a result of loss distribution in the UK. ", "Now EMEA direct markets accounted for 64% of the region sales. The remaining 36% of the EMEA sales during the quarter were generated by our EMEA distributor markets. Distributor market sales increased 10% in the second quarter due primarily to an increase of 20% in sales in Russia. Although the market conditions in Russia have began to stabilize and sales have increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our year-to-date sales have not returned to the level we experienced prior to the political and economic crisis in Russia. We would like to remind our investors that the political and economic instability in the region makes it difficult for us to predict what level of sales we will have in this market in the future.", "Now let's pop down to Asia Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia Pacific which includes Australia, China, and other countries in the region increased to 15.2 million in the second quarter, up 14% from last year. In Australia net sales in U.S. dollars were 3.9 million in the second quarter flat compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on these results and its functional currency, the Australian dollar sales were down 2% for the quarter primarily due to the timing of promotional activities and certain promotional programs that were conducted in the second quarter of last year but not repeated this year.", "In China, sales in U.S. dollars were 3.4 million in the second quarter up 17% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on these results. In its functional currency, the Chinese RMB sales were up 25% in the quarter. The growth in China was due to new distribution and increased promotional activities. We continue to remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in China although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, and shifting economic patterns and varying of industrial activities. ", "In our Asian distributor markets net sales was 7.9 million in the quarter up 21% compared to last year. The sales increases were driven primarily by higher levels of promotional activities particularly in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand and the timing of some customer orders. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we will -- we sell that product in U.S. dollars in that region. I will pull out now, and turn over to Jay who will continue to review the financials. ", "Jay Rembolt", "Thanks Gary. First let's review our 55, 30, 25 business model, the long-term targets we use to guide our business. You may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be 55% of sales. But 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of sales and finally the 25 represents EBITDA. First the 55 of our gross margin, in the second quarter our gross margin was 56.4% compared to the 55.4% in the second quarter of last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our gross margins by 160 basis points. This is because in EMEA our cost of goods are sourced primarily in pounds sterling. While approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in Euros with 25% in U.S. dollars and only the remaining 30% are generated in pound sterling. ", "The combined effect of the strengthening of both the Euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling caused revenues in total to be worth more in sterling thus improving our gross margin. Additionally advertising, promotion, and other discounts that we give to our customers decreased compared to the last year in our Americas segment and positively impacted our gross margin by 30 basis points. These improvements to gross margin were partially offset by sales and exchanges and other miscellaneous costs which negatively impacted our margin by 70 basis points. ", "Primarily due to product mix shifts in the Americas and the fact that a larger portion of our sales in EMEA were made within our lower margin distributor markets. Also negatively impacting our gross margin this year were changes in the cost of the petroleum based specialty chemicals in aerosol cans which together impacted our gross margin by just 10 basis points. We experienced positive impacts on gross margin from costs in the Americas but these were more than offset by some unfavorable impacts in EMEA and to a lesser extent in Asia Pacific. Well cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals for our EMEA segment are sourced in pound sterling, the underlying inputs are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result of the overall strength in the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling from period to period resulting in a significant increase in the cost of goods in pound sterling. ", "Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 10 basis points due to some higher warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily associated with the Americas. And that completes our discussion on gross margin now we will address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the second quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 35% and flat as a percentage compared to last year. While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make thoughtful and deliberate investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence and to support the long-term growth objectives of the business. And this includes investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance, intellectual property protection in order to safeguard the blue and yellow can with a little red top. We expect to move closer to our long-term target of 30 over time as revenues continue to grow.", "For the second quarter 78% of the cost of doing business came from three areas, people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, the investments we make in marketing, advertising, and promotion. As a percentage of sales our A&P investment was 5.2% in the second quarter. And then finally freight cost, the cost to get our products to our customers. And that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55, 30, 25 measures. ", "EBITDA was 21% of net sales in the second quarter compared to 22% last year. That completes our discussion of the 55, 30, 25 business model for the current quarter. Now I will discuss a couple of other items worth noting. Operating income was 18.9 million in the second quarter compared to 17.9 million last year reflecting a 5% increase year-over-year. Again Gary mentioned earlier we typically don't discuss operating income but thought it was worth noting because of the non-operating items which were affecting our net income and diluted earnings per share in the quarter. One of the items impacting net income this quarter was a significant variance to the prior year in other income and expense of which the majority was related to large foreign currency gains which were recorded in the second quarter of 2016. ", "Also impacting net income this quarter is the provision for income taxes which was 32.8% in the second quarter compared to 28% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by an adjustment that we recorded in the second quarter associated with the tax impacts from unrealized foreign currency exchange losses. We expect our tax rate for the full fiscal year however to be close to 30%.", "Net income for the second quarter was 12.4 million versus 13.7 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on the translation of our consolidated results. On a constant currency basis net income would have remained relatively flat compared to the same period last year. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.87 in the second quarter compared to $0.94 in the same period last fiscal year. And diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.1 million from 14.4 million shares a year ago. ", "Now a word about our capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing for long-term growth while providing returns to our stockholders. We target maintenance CAPEX of between 1% and 2% of net sales and as Gary mentioned earlier on our call in addition to the maintenance CAPEX in the current year we're making an investment of approximately 18.5 million to buy and renovate a new office building to house our San Diego based tribe members. ", "In the first quarter of the fiscal year we closed ESCROW on the property and invested 10.7 million in the building in the San Diego neighborhood of Scripps Ranch. We are currently in the process of renovating this building and plan to relocate there later this fiscal year. In addition we continued to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On March 21st our Board of Directors approved our regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share payable April 28th to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 14th. Based on today's closing price of 106.95, the annualized dividend yield is 1.8%. So far this fiscal year we have repurchased approximately 174,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $18.7 million under our current $75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in June of 2016. At the end of the second quarter we had 56.3 million remaining under the plan. ", "With that let's turn to guidance. While net income and EPS guidance has not changed we have revised some of the other components of our fiscal 2017 guidance. Net sales growth is projected to be between 2% and 4% with net sales expected to be somewhere between $390 million and $395 million. Gross margins for the full fiscal year is expected to be above 56%. Advertising and sales -- advertising and promotion investment is projected to be below 6% and net income will be projected to be between $51.3 million and $52.3 million. ", "Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.64 and $3.71 and that is based on estimated 14.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder this guidance doesn't include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes foreign currency rates and crude oil prices will remain close to current levels for the duration of 2017. And that completes the financial overview. Now back to Gary. ", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Jay. So let's sum up on the call and what did you hear from us on this call today. You heard that globally maintenance products sales grew 4% in the second quarter. You heard that our operating income grew 5% in the second quarter. You heard that our diluted earnings per share and net income were negatively impacted as a result of fluctuations in some non-operating currency related items period-over-period as well as an adjustment that we recorded to our income tax expense in the second quarter of the year. ", "You heard that foreign currency exchange rates continued to be a headwind and on a constant currency basis reduced our net sales by approximately 6.4 million. Additionally you heard that the reduction in sales was significantly offset by 4.3 million in transaction related impacts in the EMEA due to the strengthening of the Euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling. You heard that our sales was strong in Canada and that we believe the market will continue to see growth in the coming quarters. You heard that our sales were strong in Asia with a 21% sales growth in our distributor markets and a 17% sales growth in China. You heard we are maintaining our net income and EPS guidance for the fiscal year but we revised a couple of other components of our fiscal year guidance.", "In closing I'd like to share this thought with you which I originally wrote in our 2015 annual report to shareholders. The vision crushing ritual of quarterly earnings is no measure of success. The company must have a clear and compelling vision and a set of cold values that drive the culture. Values must be clearly acted upon, a clear set of strategic drivers must determine how time, talent, treasure and technology are invested to achieve the state of outcomes. I believe as long as we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives and stay focused we will deliver on our 2025 vision. Thank you for joining us today and we would be pleased to now open the conference call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please proceed with your question. ", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good afternoon Gary, good afternoon Jay. ", "Jay Rembolt", "Good afternoon Liam. ", "Liam Burke", "Gary could you give us a little update on how you're rolling out the EZ-REACH delivery system outside of the North American markets?", "Jay Rembolt", "Surely, and currently the only market that it has gone into outside of the U.S. is Australia and that launched there in the second quarter. We would expect that later in the year we will see it go into EMEA, maybe not later in this fiscal year. We've just completed the work to order made one of the machines that make the core element which has given it the increased capacity that we wanted to be able to take it out into other markets. So, for the rest of this fiscal year primarily U.S. and some for Australia. ", "Liam Burke", "Okay, I think I got this right, you mentioned that the WD-40 BIKE product in Europe or EMEA was up 40%, is that\u2026 ", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, that is correct. ", "Liam Burke", "Is that doable in other regions or is that just unique to Europe and how does that make you think about other brand extensions?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, there are a lot more BIKE centric markets in Europe. Thinking of places like Denmark and whatever so there are a number of markets over there that we have been able to build distribution a little more widely than we have in the U.S. because they're not as modernized as the U.S. but we are very -- we are pleased that we've now been able to -- with the line of bike product determine which of the SKUs that are most important to us. We've also had really good success with BIKE in Canada. We now have BIKE products distributed through Canada, right through our Canadian Tire which was a great win for us as well. So it's a long-term play but it's coming in to what we wanted to and that's to be part of the family and it's seasonal too as you know. So, that's something that we deal with that's not normal for us. ", "Liam Burke", "Okay, thank you Garry. ", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Liam.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Hi, how are you? ", "Garry Ridge", "Good.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "So Garry, I think when you guys originally gave the guidance for the fiscal year you listed off quite a few growth initiatives, I thought it sounded like a lot for this year including well, I think you are expanding the BIKE line into the U.S. and then on RV line for under 3 and 1 for the U.S. and things like that. So can you just remind us what these things are and what the timing is so, I'm trying to look for confidence that you can have decent sales growth in the second half even though your comparisons in the prior year actually get quite a bit harder.", "Jay Rembolt", "Okay, sure. In the U.S. the two major initiatives were the launch of WD-40 Specialist Grease and that launch started in November. It has full distribution now in Home Depot and we're actually coming into the Grease season now and it\u2019s being, the distribution is moving out into other retail chains and other customers. But Grease is very seasonal, it's a lot stronger through spring and summer as people start to put their boats in water and whatever. So that was one, the second is WD-40 Specialist degreaser product line. We had expected that to be a little more dominant in the second quarter. We had a delay in our launch in that and in fact are only now starting to ship that and you'll start to see that in shelves through the third and the fourth quarter.", "The other initiatives were in Europe. They are the products going into distribution but that won't have a huge impact on us. That's a small part of the business. In Europe one of the major growth impacts was the increasing of WD-40 Smart Straw and we're starting to progressively convert more countries to a greater percentage of Smart Straw. We started that in Denmark and now moving into that in the UK in quarter three and four. And then on top of that of course is the overall growth of the MUP product, the blue and yellow can and particularly in regions like China and some of Asia and through some of the distributor markets. And I think those were the major Jay, Wendy did I miss any of the major. ", "Jay Rembolt", "No, this is the kind of the key initiatives.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, and then well what about, I mean you mentioned the strength of the - I think that's the motorbike line, right, not regular bikes. Motorbike in Europe -- so is the motorbike line rolling out in the U.S.? ", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, we are going to start shipping motorbikes in the U.S. in the third quarter. And it will be initially going into a couple of customers. As we get confident that the SKU offering we have developed, even though our research tells us it's right we like -- as you know we like to pilot things a little bit so we are going to roll that out and then it will become fully into distribution late in the latter part of the year and into the early part of next year.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, thank you that's very helpful. And then when you look at the gross margin guidance I mean you kind of just kind of modified the wording such that it's a little bit more favorable for the year in the sense that you said above instead of around I think was the words before. So, it looks to me like FX and the oil comparison - oil is about the same as it was last quarter when you reported, so what makes you change that to be a little more favorable on the gross margin guidance? ", "Garry Ridge", "Well, the impact from currency was quite significant this year certainly through where we are today and it looks like we should be able to continue maintaining the gross margin where we're at, unless currency rates change quite a bit. The other aspect is that most of our costs that we are going to see in our cost of goods are already in our system. By the time we have the -- are affected by any change in costs it is about three to four months maybe. So we're going to see we've got I think a much better view of our ability to achieve that in the second half.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, so it's more like a confidence level more than something majorly changing. ", "Garry Ridge", "Right. ", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, I got you. And then just on the A&P ratio, it is sort of like I mean if you've been a little bit struggling to achieve your targeted top line growth I wonder about the idea that you're actually lowering the plans for advertising and promotion spend. I mean is that kind of a dangerous strategic way to approach it, it seems like you might want to spend more if you're having trouble generating top line?", "Garry Ridge", "We're not deliberately making any short-term or long-term changes to our execution. We are finding some efficiencies and as you know a lot of our marketing is not advertising. It is other activity; sampling, trade shows. In fact only a small portion of our business is -- or our marketing is what you would call traditional advertising. The other thing is that because we are broiling the brand under the WD-40 brand as well we're making sure that we're getting good efficiencies there. And through the year if you look at where we are through the year we have to substantially increase to even get to the 6% for the year. ", "So we will come in below 6%. We are not saying how far below of course because we're not there yet but we felt it was -- this was not a decision we made to preserve the bottom line. This was an outcome probably more of a confidence thing as well as saying well, here's where we are now, where do we think we will be for the rest of the year.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay and then finally look in terms of the lowering of the sales guidance, you know I mean because actually Canada was pretty good in the quarter and you've got these other initiatives that are going to be kicking in, in the second half. And FX hasn't really changed all that much so I mean what is it that's really different, like what are the key things that are different in the outlook that makes you lower that sales line? ", "Garry Ridge", "Mexico is not going to get any better. So we know that now and we're tracking a couple of million for the year behind in Mexico. And the mix of sales is a little different. In fact we're getting more revenue out of Europe as a percentage than before and that revenue now is translating into a lower consolidated number because of the pound. So there's a little mix going on there and then there's a few other markets that when we looked at the full year we thought it was prudent to just trim a little bit. But mainly it's a mix of sales out of Europe, a little bit out of Mexico, well that is not a little bit, a couple of million out of Mexico probably and then the balance is just getting sure about the year.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Okay, alright thanks so much Garry. ", "Jay Rembolt", "Well the other thing two into two is when you look at the performance of homecare products we don\u2019t talk about it but they are down and we talk about them being down. When you look at the core business which is our maintenance products it was up 4% in the quarter and we're happy with the way that all of that is tracking. So, the homecare products does have an impact on the top line.", "Linda Bolton Weiser", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Hi everyone, how are you doing. I was just wondering if it is -- why it doesn't make sense maybe to go from the Multi-Use product to straight to the EZ-REACH Straw, why you take the step to go to the Smart Straw first. I mean would it make more sense just to go I guess the more advanced product? ", "Garry Ridge", "No, the people in the homes don't want that. The EZ-REACH is being developed for our heavy end users that's why we only put it into one size of one can. But all the people who have cans under the sinks in homes don't want to pay for the extra flexi straw because it doesn't add value to them. It adds value to people who want to get the product to an unusual places more often. So it is not either the whole.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "Garry Ridge", "Okay.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today's conference call and ask that you please disconnect your lines. "]}

At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.", "In addition to the financial information presented on today\u2019s call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release and Form 10-Q for the period ending May 31, 2017. These documents are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.wd40company.com.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Wendy. Good day and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of $98.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, which was an increase of 2% from the third quarter of last fiscal year and a new company record. Net income for the third quarter was $14.4 million compared to $12.7 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were also a new company record at $1.02 compared to $0.88 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Now, let\u2019s start with the discussion about our strategic initiatives. Strategic initiative number one is to grow the WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people who will find more uses more frequently. In the third quarter, global sales of multi-use products were up slightly compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The softness came from the Americas segment and was offset by stronger sales in Asia-Pacific and the EMEA segment. I will discuss these fluctuations in more detail when I review the results by segment.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Once we have built equity and established the power of the shield in a particular geography, we can leverage that brand recognition to develop new product lines like WD-40 Specialist. In the third quarter, global sales of WD-40 Specialist, was $7.3 million, which represents a 30% increase over the third quarter of last year. In fact, we had double-digit growth of WD-40 Specialist across all three trading blocks in the third quarter. The initial acceptance of our new WD-40 Specialist Greases in the U.S. has been very encouraging. Additionally, we delivered our first shipment of WD-40 Specialist Greases in the U.S. at the end of June. We continue to believe that WD-40 Specialist will be a sustainable revenue and earnings growth engine for many years to come.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from new sources and brands. We continue to expand the product offerings within our 3-IN-ONE and GT85 brands as well as WD-40 BIKE. In the third quarter, we launched 3-IN-ONE RBK product line. It\u2019s a very early time for this, but we are excited and see lots of future opportunity with maintenance products in this new channel.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop, and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop, and retain talented tribe members. Our long-term target under this initiative is to grow employee engagement to greater than 95%. As we shared with our investors earlier this fiscal year, we completed the acquisition of a new building that will house our San Diego-based tribe members. We are currently in the final process of renovating the property and expect to relocate our tribe to the new office facilities in late August.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems, and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection. Recently, we held our annual R&D and quality summit, where our researchers, scientists, and quality assurance tribe members gathered together to collaborate and gain alignment on some of the global opportunities and challenges our tribe is facing related to quality assurance, innovation, and regulatory compliance. The summit is a living breathing example of our tribe consistently striving to make it better than it is today.", "That completes the update on our strategic initiatives. So, let\u2019s move on to the details of the third quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were $98.2 million in the third quarter, up $1.7 million versus last year. If we remove all foreign currency exchange impacts, our consolidated revenue would have been about $100.3 million, up $2.1 million or 4% compared to the third quarter of last fiscal year. This $2.1 million difference is due to the fact that in the third quarter we generated approximately 40% of our sales in currencies other than U.S. dollar and changes in foreign currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our consolidated results.", "Translation of foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales of $4.7 million. On a constant currency basis, total net sales would have been $102.9 million, an increase of 7% compared to last year. This is what we refer to as translational related exposure and it impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China, and the EMEA segment. However, due to changing foreign currency exchange rates, our consolidated net sales were actually improved this quarter by about $2.6 million due to the transaction related impacts. This currency exposure only impacts our reported EMEA results, and primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling.", "Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s happening in the individual segments. We will start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas, which includes the United States, Latin America, and Canada decreased to $49 million in the third quarter, down about 2% from last year. Sales of maintenance products in the Americas decreased 1% in the third quarter, primarily due to the 3% decrease in the sales of maintenance products in the United States. The decrease in the United States was driven primarily by shifting buying patterns in some trade channels as well as efforts of certain customers to more closely manage inventory levels. Maintenance products sales in Canada were up 10% in the third quarter, primarily driven by improving market and economic conditions as well as increase in sales associated with our promotional programs. Maintenance product sales in Latin America were up 8% in the quarter, primarily due to higher sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product in Mexico. Although sales in Mexico increased in the current quarter, business conditions in Mexico continue to be uncertain. As a reminder, our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products. We continue to consider our homecare and cleaning products specifically in the U.S. as harvest brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions in cash flows, but I generally expect it to become a smaller part of the business over time. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 5% in the third quarter compared to the same period of last year.", "Now, let\u2019s go on to EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA which includes Europe, Middle East, Africa and India increased to $34.4 million in the third quarter, up 4% from last year. EMEA\u2019s reported results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, sales in EMEA would have been $38.9 million, an increase of $6 million or 18% compared to the last year. However, these constant currency numbers do not paint a complete picture since we experienced favorable impacts of $2.6 million from transaction related exposures in the third quarter.", "We think the very best way to give you a complete look at how our markets are performing is to look at our results in local currencies in which we conduct sales transactions in our direct markets. Although the reported sales in direct markets decreased 1% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter, sales in euro based direct markets increased 4% driven by growth throughout Continental Europe mainly due to increased sales of WD-40 Specialist. Sales in our pound based direct markets increased by 8% driven by strong sales of maintenance products. Our EMEA direct markets accounted for 64% of the region sales. The remaining 36% of EMEA sales during the quarter were generated by our distributor markets. Distributor market sales increased 16% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Products in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia as a result of more stable market conditions in the region. We would like to remind investors that political and economic instability in the region makes it difficult for us to predict what level of sales we will have in this market in the future.", "If we now could we will go down to Asia-Pac. Consolidated net sales in Asia Pacific which includes Australia, China and other countries in the region increased to $14.7 million in the third quarter, up 8% from last year. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales, fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates impacted sales results in both China and Australia. In Australia net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.5 million in the third quarter, up 4% compared to last year, changes in foreign currency exchange rates has a favorable impact on these results. In its functional currency, the Australian dollar sales were up 1% in the quarter primarily due to continued growth of the base business. In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were $3.6 million in the third quarter, up 6% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on these results. In its functional currency, the Chinese RMB sales were up 12% in the quarter. The growth in China was primarily due to new distribution and continued growth in sales in our largest customers in the region. We continue to remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in China. However, we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution shifting economic conditions and varying industrial activities.", "In our Asian distributor markets net sales was $6.7 million for the quarter, up 12% compared to last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the timing of customer orders and a high level of promotional activities for WD-40 Multi-Use Product particularly in Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell our products in U.S. dollars.", "I will take the pause now and turn over to Jay and ask him to review the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thanks, Garry. First, let\u2019s review our 55/30/25 business model, the long-term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be a 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales. And that leaves us finally with the 25, which represents EBITDA.", "First, the 55 our gross margin, in the third quarter, our gross margin was 55.3% compared to 56.8% in the third quarter of last year. Net changes in major input costs, which include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, negatively impacted our gross margin by 180 basis points in the current quarter primarily due to the increased cost associated with petroleum-based products. As you know, crude oil was one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals. This impact is even more pronounced in our EMEA segment, where cost of petroleum-based specialty chemicals are sourced in pound sterling, yet the underlying inputs are denominated in U.S. dollars. The overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling from period to period resulted in a significant increase in cost of goods in pound sterling.", "Sales mix and other miscellaneous costs also negatively impacted our gross margin by 50 basis points primarily due to product shifts in the Americas. Advertising, promotional and other discounts increased compared to last year in our Americas segments and negatively impacted our gross margin by 20 basis points. The gross margin was also negatively impacted by 10 basis points, due to higher warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which positively impacted our margin by 100 basis points. This is because in EMEA, our cost of goods are primarily sourced in pound sterling, while approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros, with 25% in U.S. dollars and only the remaining 30% are generated in pound sterling. The combined effect of the strengthening of both the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling caused revenues in total to be more in pound sterling thus improving our gross margin. The gross margin was also positively impacted by 10 basis points due to selected price increases, which were implemented in our EMEA segment over the last 12 months.", "As a reminder, our gross margin target of 55% is not contingent on oil stain at any particular price point. We cannot control global market dynamics such as the price of crude oil or fluctuating currencies, but we can and are continuing to be focused and deliver in managing the rest of our business, so that we can maintain gross margin at a level close to our target 55% over the long-term. And that completes our discussion on gross margin. Now, we will address the 30 or our cost of doing business.", "In the third quarter, our cost of doing business declined to 33%, down from 36% last year. This decline is primarily due to lower employee related costs along with lower A&P investments as well as the increased leverage gained by higher reported revenues compared to the prior year period. While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make thoughtful and deliberate investments in support of our fifth strategic initiative that of operational excellence. And to support the long-term growth objectives of our business and this includes investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard the blue and yellow can with the little red top. We expect to move closer to our long-term target of 30 over time as revenues grow. For the third quarter 75% of our cost of business came from three areas our people costs, the investments we make in our tribe, the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion. As a percentage of sales our A&P investment was 5.5% in the third quarter compared to 6.4% in the prior year period. And finally freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers and that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 23% of net sales in the third quarter compared to 20% last year.", "Now as we completed our discussion of the 55/30/25 business model, I will go on and discuss the couple of other items worth noting. Other income and expense changed by $1.1 million from quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses. We recorded foreign currency exchange gains of less than $100,000 in the third quarter this year. This compares to $800,000 in foreign currency exchange losses that we experienced last year. The change was primarily due to the relative movement of foreign currency exchange rates and the fluctuation of non-functional currency balance sheet accounts. The provision for income taxes was 28.8% in the third quarter compared to 28.1% last year. The increase was primarily driven by a slight shift of expected annual earnings generated between the U.S. and foreign operations year-over-year.", "Net income for the third quarter was $14.4 million versus $12.7 million in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on the translation of our consolidated results. On a constant currency basis net income would have been $15.1 million in the quarter. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.02 in the third quarter compared to $0.88 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.1 million shares from 14.3 million shares a year ago.", "Now a word about capital allocation, our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long-term growth while providing strong returns for our stock holders. We target our maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales and as Garry mentioned earlier on the call in addition to our maintenance CapEx in the current year, we are making an investment of approximately $18.5 million to buy and renovate a new office building to house our San Diego based tribe members. In addition, we continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On June 20, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share payable July 31 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 21. Based on today\u2019s closing price of $110.30, the annualized dividend yield is 1.8%. So far in this fiscal year we have repurchased approximately 245,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $26.2 million under their current $75 million share repurchase plan which had been approved by the Board of Directors in June of 2016. As of the end of the third quarter we had $48.8 million remaining under the plan.", "With that, let\u2019s turn to guidance. We have lowered our fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance. However, our remaining guidance remains unchanged. Net sales is projected to be flat to up 2% with net sales expected to be between $382 million and $388 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be above 56%. Advertising and promotion investment is projected to be below 6% with net income expected to be between $51.3 million and $52.3 million. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.64 and $3.71 based on 14.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, this guidance doesn\u2019t include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that currency rates will \u2013 and crude oil prices will remain close to current levels for the duration of 2017.", "That completes the financial overview, now I will turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks Jay. In closing, let\u2019s summarize what you did hear from us on the call today. You heard that we reported net sales of $98.2 million, a new record for the company in the third quarter. You heard that reported diluted earnings per share of $1.02, another company record. You heard that globally maintenance product sales grew 3% in the third quarter. You heard that global sales of WD-40 Specialists grew 30% this quarter and that we had double digit growth of Specialist in all three trading blocks. You heard that foreign currency exchange rates continue to be a headwind and on a constant currency basis reduced that net sales by approximately $4.7 million. Additionally, you heard that this reduction in sales was significantly offset by $2.6 million in transaction related impacts in EMEA due to the strengthening of the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling. You heard that we are maintaining our net income and EPS guidance for fiscal year, but that we are lowering our revenue guidance. So historically in closing today which is the last conference call we will do from the facility here in Cudahy Place, I would like to share with you a quote from Simon Sinek, it\u2019s better to go slow in the right direction than to go fast in the wrong direction.", "Thank you for joining us today. And we would be pleased now to open the conference call for your questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Hi everyone, how are you doing?", "Garry Ridge", "Good, Daniel.", "Jay Rembolt", "Very good. Thank you.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Could you just provide some color on the \u2013 you mentioned inventory management in the U.S., I was wondering if that\u2019s going to persist and potentially through third quarter. And also I was looking for color on that, I guess you said something about shifting buying patterns, I just kind of wondered kind of what that means?", "Garry Ridge", "Sure. Thanks Daniel. At the end of third quarter of last year, we had a number of our customers in the U.S. that helped us in the completion of our 50-state VOC transfer to get to the full U.S. 50-state compliance, so there were revenues in the third quarter of last year that included those purchases that aren\u2019t there this year. So those are the shifting buying patterns that we see. So I would not suggest you that this is a systemic issue, it\u2019s more of an event than a trend.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then so that\u2019s what you are talking about inventory overhang as well, then?", "Garry Ridge", "Correct.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then it just seem like also that the Americas EBIT was up significantly sequentially year-over-year versus everything else, I was wondering I mean given some of the inventory de-stocking issues and some of the near-term headwinds you had while that is like I just was wondering why you have done so well with that?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, a couple of reasons. Number one is that our operating expenses, the leverage was greater in the quarter than before. So, I think that\u2019s number one. Number two is that the U.S. is not going to maximize its GRP, which is our growth reward program this year, which is how a number of our pay-for-performance elements are established for our U.S. based employees. So, some of our employee costs and accruals are down for the year, but I think that given the state of the business, I think it\u2019s because the tribe are managing through different waters, yes, pretty well. And if you look overall, our household products were down 5% and they continue to decline as part of our total revenue, which we have been talking about for many years now. Our core business is growing. And if you were to take out the currency fluctuations, our core business is growing at a reasonable rate. So, there is a lot of noise I think in the reporting, and if there has been particularly because of currency for a while, but our core business is doing well and we will continue to work towards our long-term goals, which we are still very comfortable with and intend on delivering on over time.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Alright, cool. Thank you for the color.", "Garry Ridge", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}

[Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.", "In addition to the financial information presented on today\u2019s call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release and Form 10-K for the period ending September 30, 2017.

Good day and thanks for joining us for today\u2019s conference call. Today, we reported net sales of $96.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, which was a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was $14.4 million compared to $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 1%.", "Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.01 compared to $0.99 for the same period last year. For the full fiscal year net sales were $380.5 million which is essentially flat over last fiscal year.", "On a constant currency basis, total net sales would have been $399.6 million for the full fiscal year, up 5% over last year. This is what we refer to as translational related exposure and impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China, and the EMEA segment. However, we also experienced transaction related impacts from their foreign currency exchange rates, exclusively from our EMEA segment which resulted in a favourable impact on our consolidated net sales. So if we removed all currency related impacts from our fiscal year results, net sales would have increased 2%.", "Net income was $52.9 million in fiscal year 2017 reflecting an increase of 1% and diluted earnings per share for the full year set a new record for the company at $3.72 compared to $3.64 in the prior fiscal year.", "I believe today\u2019s results demonstrate that our robust to business model and global diversification can deliver record earnings even in times of currency exchange headwinds. For the purpose of this call, after discussing our strategic initiatives we\u2019ll be focussing primarily on financial and operational results for the fourth fiscal quarter.", "For a complete discussion of our full year\u2019s results for 2017, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today or our annual report on Form-10K which we expect to file with the SEC on Monday, October 23.", "Let\u2019s start with a discussion about our strategic initiatives. Today, we will share with investors a revised view of our strategic initiatives and the 2025 revenue targets associated with them. These revisions take into consideration the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the resulting reduction in sales that we have experienced over the last couple of years.", "As we embark into fiscal year 2018, we believe that the most significant foreign currency exchange headwinds are now behind us and therefore believe it is an appropriate time to review our long term revenue targets and how we are going to accomplish them.", "Our new long term revenue target is to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025. I\u2019ll break down how we intend to get there in just a moment.", "If an event occurs that causes significant shifts in foreign currency exchange rates, these targets may once again become a risk. With that, where are we going and how are we going to get there?", "Strategic initiative number one is to grow the WD-40 multi use product. Now most important strategic initiative continues to would be to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people who will find more uses more frequently.", "In the fourth quarter, global sales of multi use product declined 2%, the decline came from our America segments specifically the United States and was partially offset by stronger sales in both Asia Pacific and the EMEA segments.", "Despite these mixed results, we are optimistic about the long term prospects for our flagship product. We believe there are many opportunities in front of us that will enable us to achieve our new long term revenue target which is to grow WD-40 multi used product to approximately 530 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025.", "In our developed markets we will continue to drive the revenue growth through innovation with products like WD-40 EZ-REACH Flexible Straw and through the continued conversion of end users to our more innovative Smart Straw delivery system. In our developing and emerging markets we will continue to build the brand awareness among end users and make our products easy to buy through the building of new distribution.", "This is a winning formula that we followed for 64 years and we know it works. Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 Specialist Product line. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the WD-40 specialist line and create growth through continued geographic expansion as well as by developing new products and product categories within identified platforms.", "In the fourth quarter, sales of WD-40 Specialist was $7.3 million bringing specialist sales to $25.8 million for the full fiscal year which represents a 20% increase compared to last year. In fiscal 2017, we launched our lines of WD-40 Specialist industrial strength to Greases, Greases, and Speciality automotive products.", "We also expanded WD-40 Specialist Motorcycle and WD-40 Specialist Lawn & Garden products into new geographies. We are optimistic about the long term opportunities for specialists and now believe we can grow the product line to approximately $100 million in revenues by the end of fiscal 2025.", "To accomplish this, we will continue at geographic expansion and will develop products and product categories within our identified platforms. Keep in mind there may be some volatility of sales along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the launch of these new product offerings and the building of new distribution.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product base \u2013 the product and revenue base. Our revised goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from existing brands as well as new sources and products.", "Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products like three in one, WD-40 bike, GT85 that has been expanded to include brands such as Spot Shot, Lava in the Americas 1001 in [EMEA and Novak] and Solvol in Asia Pacific.", "In fiscal year 2017 we saw solid growth from our maintenance products under this initiative we launched a new line of products under the three in one brand in the United States designed for recreational vehicles and we saw solid growth of WD-40 Bike. Both product lines demonstrate our ability to appeal to passionate hobbyist and we expect to continue growth from these maintenance products into the future.", "We continue to consider our home care and cleaning products particularly those in the U.S. as harvest brands which are expected to become a smaller part of their business overtime. We\u2019ve spent the last several years better understanding how each of these brands perform in their own unique channel and geography. Many of these generate sizeable revenues and they all generate meaningful profitable contributions and cash flows. Ultimately, we believe we can continue to nurture the products included under this initiative and expect their contributed combined revenue to reach approximately $70 million by the end of fiscal 2025. So if you add all those up, I think it comes to 700.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our long term target under this initiative is to grow our employee engagement to greater than 95% from its current 93%. At the end of the fiscal year we had 448 tribe members globally.", "In August, we successfully relocated our San Diego base tribe members to a new office building. Our new offices were specifically designed to increase engagement and collaboration and I\u2019m delighted to report that after only two months in our new space I\u2019ve witnessed the tribe collaborating more and more in new ways.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 company make it better than it is today. We are continuously focussed on optimizing resources, systems and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection.", "We measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to the processes and systems while still safeguarding the blue and yellow can with a little red top.", "That completes the update of our strategic initiatives, so now let\u2019s move onto more of the details of our fourth quarter results starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were $96.6 million in the fourth quarter, down $600,000 versus last year.", "In the fourth quarter we generated approximately 40% of our sales in currencies other than in U.S. dollar. The translation of foreign subsidiary results from their functional currency to the U.S. dollar had an unfavourable impact of $1.9 million. In sales, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have been $98.5 million in the fourth quarter an increase of 1% compared to last year; this is what we refer to as translation related exposure and impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China and the EMEA segment.", "However due to changing foreign currency exchange rates our consolidated net sales were actually improved this quarter by about $2.1million due to the transaction related impacts. This currency exposure only impacts our reported results from EMEA, and was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound, sterling.", "The fourth quarter of 2017 is the first time in a very long time that foreign currency exchange rates in total have benefitted our reporting results. Net, net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favourable impact of about $200,000 on consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "We hope to see stability in foreign currency exchange rates and look forward to being out of the foreign currency exchange headwinds we have been navigating for the last couple of years.", "Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s happened in individual segments during the fourth quarter. We will start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas, which includes the United States, Latin America, and Canada decreased by 7% in the fourth quarter to $48 million.", "Sales of maintenance products decreased by 7% in the Americas, primarily due to the weak sales in the U.S. In the U.S. maintenance product sales decreased 11% due to the phasing of promotional activities at some of our larger customers. This decline was magnified because in the prior year we saw a high level of sales linked to the close out volumes of the SKUs of WD-40 Multiuse products associated with our transition of all 50 U.S. states to lower VOC formula.", "These sales were not repeated this year. In Canada, maintenance product sales were up 5% during the quarter due to the timing of promotional activities increased sales of WD-40 Specialist and WD-40 bike products and maintenance product sales in Latin America were up 24% in the fourth quarter when compared to the last year driven by increased sales of WD-40 Multiuse product particularly in Central America, Ecuador, Peru and Puerto Rico.", "Sales of Home, Care and Cleaning products in the Americas during the fourth quarter decreased 8% compared to the same period last year. Now we\u2019ll go over to EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India increased to $35.9 million in the fourth quartet up about 4% from last year. The net foreign currency exchange impacts from translation and transaction were offsetting this quarter and had a minimal impact on the regions reported results.", "As you know we sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors. Net sales in our EMEA direct markets which accounted for 66% of the regions sales increased 7% during the quarter to $23.9 million in U.S. dollars.", "The strength was driven by the timing of promotional activities and the on-going conversion of end users in the U.K. to the more innovative Smart store delivery system.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the EMEA Distributor markets which accounted to 34% of the EMEAs sales during the quarter. Distributor market sales decreased by 2% in the fourth quarter to $12.1 million, even though we saw increased sales of WD-40 Multiuse products in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia as a result of more stable market condition n the region. These increases were entirely offset by some softness we experienced due to some promotional phasing in other parts of the region.", "We\u2019d like to remind investors that the political and economical instability in many of these regions in Europe and other parts of the world make it difficult for us to predict what levels of sales we will have in these types of markets in the future.", "Now, on to Asia-Pacific, consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region increased to $12.7 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% from last year.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rate had a minimal impact on sales on a constant currency basis sales in Asia-Pacific would've been $12.6 million, an increase of 14% compared to last year.", "In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% compared to last year and its functional currency, the Australian dollar, sales increase 1% for the quarter.", "In China, net sales in U.S dollars were $4.7 million in the quarter, up 13% compared to last year and its functional currency, the Chinese R&D, sales were up 16% in the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by increased promotional activities.", "Over the last 10 years we've sold over $100 million of maintenance products in China and we continue to believe there is significant opportunity in this country for many years to come.", "We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in the region, although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, shifting economic patents and varying industrial activities.", "In Asia distributor markets net sales were $3.1 million for the quarter, up 39% compared to last year, the increase was primarily due to the timing of promotional activities and increased distribution primarily in South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency translation since we will sell our products in U.S. dollars in these markets.", "I'll take a break. And now hand over to Jay who will continue to review the results from the financial side.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. First let's start with a discussion about how we performed against our most recent issued fiscal year 2017 guidance. We\u2019d expected our fiscal year 2017 net sales to be between $382 million and $388 million.", "Today, we reported fiscal year revenue of $380.5 million, flat to prior year. We expected gross margin to be above 56% and today we reported gross margin of 56.2%. We expected our global advertising and promotion investment to be below 6% of net sales and today we reported A&P investment of 5.4%.", "We expected net income to be between $51.3 million and $52.3 million resulting in diluted EPS of $3.64 and $3.71 assuming 14.1 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "Today we reported net income of $52.9 million and a diluted EPS of $3.72 based on 14.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. Overall, we delivered full fiscal year results in line with our most recent guidance.", "As Garry has mentioned returning to topline growth continues to be a top priority for us. However we believe that our bottom-line results are solid and demonstrate the strength of our business model.", "Now let's turn to our 50/30/25 business model and review the long-term targets that we use to guide our business. As you may recall the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be at 55% of net sales.", "The 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our target is to be at 30% of net sales and that leaves us finally with EBITDA at 25%.", "First, the 55 our gross margin, in the fourth quarter our gross margin was 56% compared to 57.4% last year. Net changes in major input costs which include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, negatively impacted our margin by 170 basis points in the current quarter primarily due to the increased cost of petroleum products.", "As you know, crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals. This impact is even more pronounced in our EMEA segment where the cost of petroleum based specialty chemicals are sourced in pound sterling yet the underlying inputs are denominated in U.S. dollars.", "The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling resulted in significant increase in cost of goods. Sales mix changes and other miscellaneous costs also negatively impacted our gross margin by 90 basis points, and primarily due to product mix shifts in the Americas.", "Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 10 basis points due to higher warehousing and inbound freight costs primarily in the Americas. These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which positively impacted our gross margin by 80 basis points.", "This is because in EMEA, our cost of goods are primarily sourced in pounds sterling, while approximately 45% of our revenues are generated in euros, 25% in U.S. dollars and only the remaining 30% are generated in pounds sterling.", "The combined effect of the strength in both euro and the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling cost revenues in total to be worth more in sterling, thus improving the gross margin.", "Advertising promotional and other discounts decreased compared to last year, positively impacting gross margin by 40 basis points. Gross margin was also positively impacted by another 10 basis points due to select sales price increases which we implemented in EMEA over the last 12 months.", "As a reminder, our long-term growth margin target of 55% is not contingent on oil staying at any particular price point. We can't control global market dynamics such as the price of crude oil or fluctuating currencies, but we can continue to be focused and delivered in managing the rest of our business so that we will be able to maintain gross margin at a level close to our target of 55% over the long-term.", "Now I\u2019ll direct 30 or our cost of doing business. In the fourth quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 34% compared to 38% last year. Our goal is to have the cost of doing business be near 30%.", "The decline this year over last is primarily due to the decreased employee related costs and lower A&P investments in the fourth quarter compared to that last year. SG&A expense was $28.2 million in the fourth quarter versus $32 million in the prior year. This decrease was driven by lower employee costs which decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower earned incentive accruals associated primarily in the U.S.", "While our target is to have our cost of doing business at 30% of net sales we plan to continue to make thoughtful and deliberate investments in support of ours to strategic initiative number five that of operational excellence and to support our long-term growth objectives of the business.", "This includes investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection in order to safeguard our blue and yellow can with the little red top. We expect to move closer to our long-term target of 30% over time as revenues grow.", "For the fourth quarter 73% of the cost of doing business came from three areas, people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, along with the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion, as a percentage of sales our A&P investment was 5.5% in the fourth quarter.", "And then finally freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers. And that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 23% of net sales for the fourth quarter compared to 22% in the fourth quarter last year.", "This increase was the result of a variety of factors, but the primary driver was a decreased in employee related costs I discussed earlier. These decreases employee-related costs were substantially offset by the impacts of lower gross margin and a much lower level of other income related to foreign currency exchange gains from period to period.", "The provision for income taxes was 26.4% in the fourth quarter essentially unchanged compared to the 26.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $14.4 million versus $14.2 million in the prior year.", "Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on the translation of our consolidated results. On a constant currency basis net income would've been $14.7 million in the fourth quarter.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $1 and $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.99 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14.0 million shares from 14.3 million shares a year ago.", "For the full year results it's also worth noting that we experienced in non-operating items related to foreign currency exchange gains that favorably impacted fiscal 2016 income before taxes by $2.4 million. This level of gain was not repeated in fiscal 2017.", "In addition net interest expense unfavorably impacted results year-over-year by $1.1 million. This is primarily due to higher balances and higher interest rates associated with our line of credit.", "Now a word about our capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing for long-term growth while providing strong returns for our stockholders.", "We typically target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales and we expected to return to these levels in fiscal 2018. As a reminder our CapEx as a percent of sales was higher than normal in fiscal 2017, due to the investment we made during the year to buy and renovate a new office building to house our San Diego-based tribe members.", "We understand the importance of regular dividends to our stockholders and we targeted dividend payout of 50% of net income and have continued and consistently increased our dividend over the past seven years.", "On October 10th our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share payable October 31st to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 20th.", "Based on today's closing price of $112.65, the annualized dividend yield is 1.74%. During the fiscal year we repurchased approximately 290,000 shares at a total cost of $31.1 million under the current $75 million share repurchase plan, which was approved by the board in June 2016. As of the end of the fiscal year we had $43.9 million remaining under the plan.", "Now, look at guidance. For 2018 net sales is projected to be between 4% and 6% with net sales expected to be between $396 million and $403 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 56%, advertising and promotion investment is expected to be near 6% of net sales.", "And net income is projected to be between $52.9 million and $53.8 million. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.81 and $3.87 based on 13.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "Now that completes the financial overview, I\u2019ll turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Great. Thanks, Jay. So let me sum up and share what you may have heard on the call. You heard that our results demonstrate that our robust business model and global diversification can deliver record earnings even in time of currency exchange headwinds.", "You heard that for the fist time in a long time foreign currency exchange rates slightly benefit our reported quarterly results. You heard that for the full fiscal year we achieve EPS of $3.72 which is a new company record and above the top end of our most recently issued guidance.", "You heard that global sales of WD-40 Specialist were almost $26 million in the fiscal year of 2017, which represents a 20% increase over the last year. You heard that we issued new guidance which projects the company will return to top line growth in fiscal year 2018, hoping that exchange rights stabilize.", "You heard that we have refreshed our strategic initiatives and that a new long-term revenue target is to drive consolidated net sales to approximately $700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025.", "So in closing, I'd like to share a quote with you from John Maxwell \u201csometimes you win sometimes you learn\u201d. Thank you for joining us today and a special thank to our WD-40 global tribe members for their passion and dedication to our great company again in 2017.", "We\u2019d be please now to open the conference call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke from FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Garry, good afternoon, Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Good afternoon, Liam.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, you talked about U.S. maintenance sales being down due to tough comps where you had the different formula. How did Specialist perform underneath that and facing tough comps there?", "Garry Ridge", "Our Specialist performed very well. Specialist was up by I think 20% in the quarter and 20% in the year. So we are very, very pleased with our progress on Specialist and we continue to gain distribution of the already launched products. And this year we launched two new Specialist lines in our degreasers and greasers which were continue to gain distribution on. So, I would say, Specialist is doing what we wanted to do. And Jay is just saying -- showing me, it was -- what is it, Jay?", "Jay Rembolt", "16% in the quarter.", "Garry Ridge", "16% in the quarter and 20% in the year.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And that was U.S. or U.S. alone and North America?", "Garry Ridge", "In the U.S. Specialist sales in the U.S. were up 12% in the quarter.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. So Specialist pulled this on. This was straight tough comps through the anomaly from a year ago. Is that right, U.S. maintenance sales?", "sire where I would say I'm specialist is doing what we wanted to do. Jay is just saying, show me. What is it Jay?", "Jay Rembolt", "16% in the quarter.", "Garry Ridge", "16% in the quarter and 20% in the EU.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And that was U.S. alone and North America.", "Garry Ridge", "In the U.S. specialist up and the U.S. were up 12% in the quarter.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. So specialist pulled us on this restraint tough comps through the anomaly from a year ago, is it right in U.S. maintenance sales?", "Garry Ridge", "That\u2019s correct. And just as an add to that, we\u2019re encouraged by early results this fiscal year. From what we see so far the United States market in the first quarter is back in the growth.", "Liam Burke", "Okay, great. You have your long term plans reset. Is there any additional investment that needs to be made either in your recent \u2013 over the past two years you restructured your distribution, you\u2019ve invested in manufacturing. And I know your headquarters had nothing to do with operations, but is there any \u2013 are there any big capital projects or anything that needs to be done structurally to accomplish these $700 million in 2025?", "Jay Rembolt", "Liam, there\u2019s no sight of any major capital investments other than the ones that would be ongoing which would be continued tooling around our Smart Straw. The main operational change that we\u2019re looking at is increasing the amount of product that we actually manufacture in China and that ships into the rest of the Asian markets. So we\u2019re doing some supply chain architectural work there that'll happen over the next 18 months or so. But it shouldn\u2019t be that visible. It's just a matter of moving some product into China and then shipping product out of there into some countries that we\u2019re not necessarily shipping into out of China.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Thank you, Garry, thank you Jay.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Liam.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jeffries. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Hey, guys. How are you?", "Garry Ridge", "Good Daniel.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Good. If we think about your long term goals and the growth in Specialist I think from 26 million to 100 million. Would that suggest that just the improved product mix would drive or fuel margin expansion beyond what your current projections are or what the current 55/30 is \u201330/20 plan is? I mean, longer term could we go much higher than that just with the improved product mix?", "Garry Ridge", "We would like to think so, but the issue we\u2019ve got is oil. And right now, where we are projecting our forward margin based on oil sort of staying where it is. So oil is the big play in the middle of that. Of course a lot of Specialist products do have higher margins. So naturally margins may strengthen over time, but I think right now we\u2019re very comfortable in that 56 range that we\u2019re in and we'll see how it pans out as oil settles over the next year or so.", "Daniel Rizzo", "And given the long-term, I guess, the need for longer-term international growth and introducing your product elsewhere, would that also \u2013 just that promotional activity will also be somewhat of a headwind for again just improvement from product mix?", "Garry Ridge", "Not quite sure I understand your question. Are you asking me what?", "Daniel Rizzo", "Well, I\u2019m just wondering if promotional activity and rebates and then discounts are necessary over the long-term to continue to grow or to meet that topline revenue growth that you\u2019re looking for?", "Garry Ridge", "I don't think that will change much from historical levels. We will still be investing around near 6% in marketing and I don't believe that we have -- we will be changing our pricing structure to drive revenue. It will be about the same as it's been.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. Thanks. And then one final question. I was listening to another call today with a coating company suggesting that changing demographics in the U.S. because the less do-it-yourself product might be a less strategic headwind over the long-term or such structural change because people doing less by themselves as basically the baby boomers age. I was wondering that something that could affect you with something you're seeing or anticipate or just any color can provide around that thought?", "Garry Ridge", "Of course, we continue look at future proofing our business. If we were just in the United States, yes, people may be moving to from do-it-yourself to do it for me, but then someone's going to do that. For example you if you look at the electromechanical industry there is a bulging number of new trades people coming into that industry as we go forward as trades are moving more from just mechanical to electromechanical. Those changes happening of course with motor vehicles, if we were a company that was dependent on what I would call commodities in motor vehicles i.e. oil and fan belts and things like that.", "I think we\u2019d be more concerned, but not -- but some of the new products that we\u2019re bringing out over time I think will also take advantage of some of the changes. We\u2019ve been working with a company in Boston for a number of years looking at future proofing or looking at where opportunities may be. So it's a dynamic world out there which is a lot of fun whether it would be the impact of e-commerce or digital, whether it would be the change in usage patterns of our end users. All of these are things that we think about and we dive into on an ongoing basis.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Thank you and good afternoon everyone.", "Garry Ridge", "Good afternoon.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Just following up on the last \u2013 on Garry\u2019s answer about e-commerce, are you benefiting from e-commerce, do you have a special program that is going to actually get people -- allow people to buy more online than they are doing currently. And what will that do to your results?", "Garry Ridge", "Well, e-commerce to us is just like a new distribution channel of the past. And yes we partner with our current customers to ensure that we\u2019re supplying them with all of the tools they need to ensure that we upfront when consumers and end-users choose to buy online and not go direct to brick-and-mortar stores. We also have a whole e-commerce group within the company globally that is ensuring that we are optimized on search engines that we are there when people are searching to stop a squeak. It's WD-40 that they find.", "So e-commerce is changing fast. We\u2019re paying a lot of attention to it and we are partnering with people like Amazon and eBay and our other customers to ensure that we\u2019re in front from in China which is a huge e-commerce market and we\u2019ve got a big activity going on there. So we\u2019re very much aware of e-commerce. We\u2019re paying attention to it and it really gets back to the fundamental of our business, make the end-user aware and make it easy to buy and it's our job to make it easy for end-users to buy our products whether they go to a service station, a gas station, a hardware store and auto store or to their laptop.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And whatever you sale via Amazon, eBay and I\u2019m assuming you are referring to Alibaba in China. Do you \u2013 is the margin different depending on how you sell the product lines outside of direct versus distribution?", "Garry Ridge", "No. The margin is very similar across all of our trade channels.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And then if you could help me a little bit on the U.S. I understand that last year there was a certain amount of inventory build of the low VOC type of blue can. Does that mean that there is excess inventory currently in the channels and this is why you didn\u2019t have any promotional activity in 2017 or at least in the four quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "No. There\u2019s no excess inventory in the channels now. When there was excess inventory in the channel in the first quarter or the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year as we cleansed out all of the VOC product that wasn't 50 state compliant. We are now 50 state compliant along \u2013 we have the VOC regulations. So we kind of washed through that. And as I mentioned I think when Liam was on the line we\u2019re encouraged by early results in this fiscal year. What we seen so far as the United States market is back into the growth mode and our promotional activities are in place.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And so if you \u2013 I guess you did tell us that you are down 11% in the U.S. So could you talk about whether or not you had an impact from the Hurricanes and the earthquake in your fourth quarter? And if you not do you anticipate negative impact in the first and then positive people as people replenish their lost supply of WD-40?", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you. Yes, sure weather events of this nature have certainly impacted our company in the past. Some people won\u2019t remember, but the first truckload order of WD-40 ever was filled to meet the disaster needs of victims of hurricane Carlo along the U.S. Gulf Coast many years ago. A short-term there will likely be some disruption in sales, in Latin America for example, hurricane Irma and Maria have had a major impact on sales activity. Impacted countries through that region in the Caribbean including of St. Martin, Puerto Rico, the Dominican and Puerto Rico have all had large disruptions in the first quarter. But when you will add it all up the largest of that being Puerto Rico. It won\u2019t have a material impact on our consolidated sales.", "The other side of the coin is as recovery begins in these regions we would expect to see consumption increase. Our marketing and supply chain teams have been working on their disaster recovery plans to put in place, to make sure that areas of high need received the volumes of product they require to respond to natural disasters like the ones we've seen and this is similar to what we saw in the Philippines a couple of years ago after the flood WD-40 is a go to product for cleaning out moisture in wet engine. ", "So the bottom line is we wouldn't expect it to have a material negative impact in the first quarter. And we may see some increase in consumption as we go through the year as construction starts to happen and people start to get somewhat back to normal lives, but that's how we see it.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And so, this is included in your 4% to 6% topline growth for 2018 versus 2017?", "Garry Ridge", "As of today and what we know, yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}

[Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.", "In addition to the financial information presented on today\u2019s call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release and Form 10-Q for the period ending November 30, 2017.

The company disclaims any duty or obligation to update any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Wendy. Good day and thanks for joining us on today's conference call. I'm delighted to report for the first time in a long time that the impact of foreign currency exchange rates are not diluting our top line growth results. Today, we reported net sales of 97.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, reflecting an increase of 9% from the first quarter of last fiscal year. Net income for the first quarter was 12.6 million compared to 11.8 million in the first quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 7% period over period and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.90 compared to $0.82 for the same period last fiscal year.", "Now, let's start with the discussion about our strategic initiatives. As most of you will recall, at the end of last fiscal year, we shared with investors a revised view of our strategic initiatives and our 2025 revenue targets associated with them. Our new long-term revenue target is to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025.", "Strategic driver number one is to grow WD-40 multi-use products. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top to more places for more people. We\u2019ll find more users more frequently. We believe there are many opportunities in front of us that will enable us to achieve our anticipated target of approximately 530 million in WD-40 multi-use product revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025.", "To achieve this target, we will maximize the product line through geographic expansion, increased market penetration and development of new and unique delivery systems. In the first quarter, global sales of WD-40 multi-use product was 74.5 million, reflecting an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of last year.", "Strategic initiative number two is to grow the WD-40 specialist product line. Our goal, under this initiative, is to leverage the WD-40 specialist product line and create growth through continued geographic expansion as well as by developing new products and product categories within defined platforms. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for the WD-40 specialist and believe we can grow the product line to approximately 100 million in revenue by the end of 2025.", "Our tribe has delivered some best-in-class WD-40 specialist products over several years. As a result, we now have an exceptional portfolio of products that we are proud to have wear the WD-40 shield. It's now time to maximize the pipeline of products we've developed by enhancing the distribution through focused and deliberate geographic expansion.", "In the first quarter, global sales of WD-40 specialist was 7.5 million, reflecting a increase of 29% compared to the first quarter of last year. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunity of specialist, however there will be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution and various other factors that come with building out a new product launch.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product and revenue base. Our goal, under this initiative, is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from existing brands as well as from new sources and products. Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products like WD-40, sorry, THREE-IN-ONE, WD-40 BIKE and G T85 and has been expanded to include its brands such as Spot Shot and Lava in the Americas, 1001 in EMEA and NoVac and Solvol in Asia Pacific.", "We believe we can continue to nurture the products included under this initiative and expect their combined revenue to reach approximately 70 million by the end of fiscal 2025. We have spent the last several years better understanding how each of these brands perform in their own unique channels and geographies. Many of them generate sizable revenues and they all generate meaningful profitable contributions and cash flows. In the first quarter, global sales of products included under this initiative were 10.5 million, which is relatively flat compared to the first quarter of last year.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal, under this initiative, is to attract, develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95%. We recently announced the addition of David Pendarvis to our Board of Directors. As a Global General Counsel at Resmed, David's international experience is an asset to the business like ours, which has products available in more than 176 countries and territories worldwide.", "In fact, over the last three years, we've made several changes to our Board of Directors to ensure we have a diverse board, not just because it's the right thing to do, but we need to have a board that understands and can adapt our business to respond to the current events from San Diego to Shanghai. Accordingly, over the last three years, we've welcome Melissa Claassen who is currently living and working in Germany. Eric Etchart is a French national who has lived and worked for much of his career in China and speaks fluent Mandarin. We also are very proud to have Linda Lang serve as our Board Chair.", "Furthermore, our diverse board of directors mirrors our tribe of employees. Our 447 tribe members are truly a reflection of a global business. They live in the United Kingdom, the United States, China, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands, Spain, Malaysia and you can bet I'm not the only Australian in this tribe. Let there be no mistakes. Our global diverse workforce is driving -- is the driving force behind our thriving global business, which is just one reason we\u2019ve made another decision recently.", "As most of you know, last fiscal year, we relocated our San Diego based tribe members into a new office building designed to increase employee engagement and collaboration. Anyone who has ever visited our old offices would probably agree this investment was long overdue. What most people do not know is that our facility in Milton Keynes, which houses our UK based tribe members is nearly an exact replica of our old San Diego office. The fact is that it was built in -- it was pretty cool in 1985 when we moved in.", "Since then, we've done little to improve the office. After seeing the positive impacts of our new offices have had on our San Diego tribe, we decided it's time to invest in a new facility for our 85 UK based tribe members. We\u2019re currently looking for properties in Milton Keynes area and we hope to find a building we can buy and renovate during this fiscal year and we look forward to keeping you updated on this exciting project in the coming months.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal, under this initiative, is best summarized by one of our core values here at WD-40 Company, make it better than it is today. We are continuously focused on optimizing resources, systems and processes as well as applying rigorous commitment to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, intellectual property protection. We measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to processes and systems that will safeguard the blue and yellow can with a little red top.", "To complete the update on our strategic initiatives, so let's move on to the details of our first quarter results, starting with sales. Consolidated net sales were 97.6 million in the first quarter, up 8.3 million or 9% versus last year. Translation of our foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the US dollar had a favorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, total net sales would have been 96.2 million, an increase of 8% compared to last year. This is what we refer to as translation related impacts and impacts reported results from Canada, Australia, China and the EMEA segment. In addition, we experienced about 200,000 in transaction related impacts in EMEA. So in total, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our net sales by 1.6 million in the first quarter.", "Now, let's take a closer look at what's happening in the individual segments. We'll start with the Americas. Consolidated net sales in the Americas, which includes the United States, Latin America and Canada, increased to 46.2 million in the first quarter, up about 8% from last year. Sales of maintenance products increased by 11% in the Americas, primarily due to the higher sales of WD-40 multi-use products throughout the trading block as well as strong sales of specialist in the US and Canada.", "I'm pleased to share with you that the challenging market conditions we experienced in the United States during fiscal 2017 have eased. Accordingly, maintenance products sales in the United States increased 10% in the first quarter due to the successful promotional activities and higher sales of our WD-40 EZ-REACH delivery system. Maintenance product sales in Latin America were up 15% in the first quarter when compared to last year, driven by increased sales of multi-use product, particularly in Central America, Ecuador and Mexico.", "In Canada, maintenance product sales were up 16% during the quarter due to the timing of customer orders and promotional activities for the multi-use product WD-40. As a reminder, our maintenance products exclude our home care and cleaning products. Sales of our home care and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 7% in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year.", "Now, let's head over to EMEA. Consolidated net sales in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, increased to 35 million in the first quarter, up 16% from last year. EMEA\u2019s reported results in the first quarter were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales in EMEA increased 3.7 million or 12% compared to last year. We continue to make progress with increased distribution throughout EMEA of our WD-40 Smart Straw delivery system.", "The UK marketing team ran some very successful in-store and online promotions to help educate trade users about the Smart Straw delivery system. In fact, the tribe was able to generate over 5.5 million views in one week with the help of their Don't be a Tool video campaign. As you know, we sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors.", "Net sales in EMEA direct markets, which accounted for 64% of the region\u2019s sales, increased 13% during the quarter to 22.5 million in US dollars. We experienced strong sales growth in nearly all of our EMEA direct markets in the first quarter. The strength was driven by the timing of promotional activities in the region and very strong sales of WD-40 specialist within our Continental European direct markets.", "Now, let's have a look at our EMEA distributor markets, which accounted for 36% of EMEA sales in the quarter. Distributor market sales increased by 22% in the first quarter to 12.6 million. The strength was driven by higher sales of WD-40 multi-use products in Northern Europe and the Middle East as a result of promotional activities in the region. Of course, we'd like to remind investors that the political and economic instability in many of these regions make it difficult for us to predict what level of sales we\u2019ll have in this market in the future.", "Now, let's take a look at Asia Pacific. Consolidated net sales in Asia Pacific, which includes Australia, China and other countries in the Asian region increased to 16.4 million in the first quarter, up about 2% from last year. In Australia, net sales in US dollars were 4.5 million in the first quarter, up 1% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on these results. In its functional currency of the Australian dollar, sales were down 2% for the quarter.", "This decline was due to the timing of customers orders and lower level of promotional activities in the period. In China, net sales in US dollars were 2.9 million in the first quarter, down 9% compared to last year due to the timing of customer orders. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have an immaterial impact on reported results. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in the China region that we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional orders, the building of distribution, changing economic patterns and varying industrial activities as well as the timing of customer orders.", "In our Asian distributor markets, net sales were 9 million for the quarter, up 6% compared to last year. The increase in sales was driven primarily by a high level of promotional activities, particularly in Malaysia, South Korea and the Philippines. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency, since we sell our product in US dollars in that region.", "Now, I'd like to hand over to Jay who will continue the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. First, let's review our 55/30/25 business model, the long term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be at 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization. Our goal is to be closer to 30% of net sales. And finally, the 25 represents EBITDA.", "First, a look at the 55 or our gross margin. In the first quarter, gross margin was 55.5% compared to 57.2% last year. Net changes and major input costs, which include petroleum based specialty chemicals as well as aerosol cans negatively impacted our margin by 120 basis points in the current quarter, primarily due to increased costs of the specialty chemicals compared to last fiscal year in all three segments. As you know, crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum based specialty chemicals and the average cost of crude oil that flowed through our cost of goods sold this year was higher in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.", "So we had negative impacts to gross margin. Sales of exchanges and other miscellaneous costs also negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 30 basis points due to higher warehousing and inbound freight costs in all three segments. These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a slight positive impact to gross margin of 10 basis points. This is because in EMEA, our cost of goods are sourced primarily in pound sterling, while approximately 70% of our revenues are generated in currencies other than pound sterling.", "Advertising, promotion and other discounts decreased compared to last year period, positively impacting our gross margin by 10 basis points. And gross margin also was positively impacted by 10 basis points due to select price increases, which were implemented in EMEA over the last 12 months. I'd like to remind investors that despite the current cost increases we've seen for crude oil, our gross margin target of 55% remains unchanged. Our gross margin is not contingent on crude oil staying at any particular price point. We will continue to be focused and deliberate in managing our business so that we can maintain gross margin at a level close to the target of 55 over the long term.", "Now, I\u2019ll address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the first quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 36% compared to 37% last year. Revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving our long-term 30% target. And in the first quarter of this year, our reported revenue increase positively affected our cost of doing business percentage. In the first \u2013 for the first quarter, 76% of the cost of doing business came from three areas, people costs or the investments we make in our tribe, the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion.", "As a percentage of sales, our advertising and promotional investment was 5.2% in the first quarter. And then finally, freight costs, the costs to get our products to our customers. In the first quarter, our SG&A increased 8% compared to last year, primarily due to higher employee related costs linked to increased headcount and annual compensation increases. Also impacting SG&A was increased freight costs, primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Americas and EMEA. Various other items also contributed to the increase in SG&A expenses, including some additional costs associated with our new building in San Diego and the unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates from period to period.", "While our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30% of net sales, we plan to continue to make investments in support of the fifth strategic initiative, operational excellence, and this will include investments in quality assurance, regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection, in order to safeguard the blue and yellow can with the little red top. We expect to move closer to our long-term target of 30% over time as revenues grow.", "Well, that brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 20% of net sales for the first quarter, compared to 21% in the first quarter last year and that will complete the discussion on our 55/30/25 business model for the current quarter.", "I\u2019ll now discuss a couple of other items worth noting. The provision for income taxes was 23.7% in the first quarter compared to 28.3% last year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was driven by our recent adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. This resulted in a decrease in the company's effective tax rate of approximately 4.9 percentage points or about $800,000 for the first quarter compared to last year. Although this change in accounting can increase the volatility of the company's effective tax rate from period to period, the majority of the impact is expected to occur in the company's first quarter each fiscal year.", "Including the impact of the adoption of this accounting change, we would expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be approximately 27%. However, this excludes any impacts from the recent changes in the US tax law. These tax legislation changes are complex and significant and once our tax team has completed their assessment of this new law, we will be able to quantify the full impact of it on our effective tax rate. Based on our initial assessment, we believe the changes will have some positive impact on our annual effective rate in fiscal 2018.", "Well, net income for the first quarter was 12.6 million versus 11.8 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase of 7%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of about $200,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased about 5% compared to last year. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.90 in the first quarter compared to $0.82 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14 million shares from 14.2 million shares a year ago.", "And now, a word about our capital allocation. Our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing and long term growth while providing strong returns to our stockholders. We typically target maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales. However, our CapEx this year was higher than normal due to an investment we made during the year of 2017 to buy and renovate a new office building to house our San Diego based tribe members. As Garry mentioned earlier, we're planning to complete a similar project for our UK based tribe members.", "Therefore, in addition to our maintenance CapEx, we anticipate an investment of approximately $13 million over the next 18 months. We are in the early stages with this project, but we\u2019ll update investors as it develops. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On December 12, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share, reflecting an increase of 10% over the previous quarter\u2019s dividend of $0.49 per share.", "This increase represents the eighth consecutive year the company has raised its annual dividend over which time the dividend has increased 116%. And based on today's closing price of $118.10, the annualized dividend yield is 1.8%. During the first quarter, we repurchased just over 35,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $3.9 million under our current $75 million share repurchase plan, which was approved by the board in June of 2016. At the end of our first quarter, we had $40 million remaining under the plan.", "So with that, let's turn to fiscal 2018 guidance. We are updating the net income and diluted earnings per share guidance we gave in October to reflect our recent adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. The remainder of our guidance remains unchanged. It is important for investors to note that this updated guidance does not take into account any impact from the recent tax law changes or any actions that we may take as a result of the new legislation. Once we've had the opportunity to quantify the full impact of the revised tax law, we will update our guidance accordingly.", "Net sales growth is projected between 4% and 6% with net sales expected to be between $396 million and $403 million. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near 56%. Advertising and promotion investment is projected to be near 6% of net sales. Net income is projected to be between $54.4 million and $55.3 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.91 and $3.98 based on 13.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, the guidance doesn\u2019t include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes crude oil prices and foreign exchange rates will remain close to current levels for the duration of 2018.", "Now, that completes the financial overview and I\u2019ll turn it back to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Jay. In closing, I\u2019ll summarize what you heard from us on the call today. You heard that for the first time in a long time, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates are not diluting our top line growth results. You heard that MUP is up with 10% global growth in the first quarter. You heard that the Americas and EMEA both delivered double digit maintenance product sales growth. You heard that the global south of WD-40 specialist grew 29% in the quarter.", "You heard that we've increased our dividend 10% last month and that\u2019s the increase that represents the eighth consecutive year the company has raised its annual dividend over which time the dividend has increased 116%. You heard that we updated our fiscal year 2018 guidance for net income and diluted earnings per share to reflect our recent adoption of a new accounting standard for stock based compensation. And you heard that we expect the new tax law to have some favorable impact on our annual effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 and that once our tax team have completed their assessment, we will update our guidance accordingly.", "In closing, I'd like to share with you a quote from Richard Branson, \u201cIf your dreams don\u2019t scare you, they are too small.\u201d Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll be pleased now to open the conference call to your questions. Back to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Liam Burke from B. Riley FBR.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, this isn't a big deal, but you had strong EZ Reach sales in the US. Specialist sales were pretty strong. Those are nice margin products. But you had a little bit of unfavorable product mix in the multipurpose category. What caused that?", "Garry Ridge", "What unfavorable product mix?", "Liam Burke", "You had about 50 basis points in lower gross margins year-over-year on less favorable product mix. But during your prepared comments, you were saying EZ Reach in the US was strong. Specialist sales were good. What was in the mix that would cause that?", "Garry Ridge", "Just let me see here, Liam. There was nothing particular. When I look at the mix, there was about 1 percentage point in the US that was off and it may have been because of some of the promotional phasing of EZ Reach. We did have some major promotions going on in that area so that would probably be what I could point to.", "Liam Burke", "Okay. And on the subject of tax reform, do you see any shift in the capital structure? You should be able to repatriate some of the cash you have overseas. Would you apply any of that to debt reduction or are you comfortable with your current capital structure?", "Jay Rembolt", "Well, we\u2019re generally comfortable with our current capital structure, but certainly, that's an option for our use of cash and we wouldn't -- it wouldn't surprise -- you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do bring some back and pay down some debt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Just so in terms of the gross margin and your outlook for 2018 and for the 55%, I mean, given what oil has done, would that suggest that you\u2019re going to raise prices to offset in the back half of the year if need be to keep the target and to kind of maintain what you\u2019ve said as a long term goal.", "Garry Ridge", "Thanks, Daniel. Right now, we\u2019re looking at the flow through of oil. As you may recall, it takes 90 to 120 days for oil to flow through. Currently, we're seeing oil at around the $62 mark. It was probably in the mid-50s or so prior to that. We have taken some pricing in some areas of the world where some of the oil impact is a little higher, particularly in Europe. But at this time, we\u2019re really not anticipating any real pricing changes. What we are seeing is the ability to maintain margins through our premiumization, which is primarily the conversion of Smart Straw in Canada, sorry, in the EMEA segment and some of the other products that we're bringing and some of the specialist products.", "So we are very committed to our 55 or greater gross margin. We've been managing through oil at varying levels for many years. If oil does do something unexpectedly in spiking, then, we'll make a decision then and we may take a hit for a short period of time, but it will only be a short period of time. So right now, we've not changed our guidance and we feel comfortable where we are. We'll see what happens in the next 90 to 120 days.", "Daniel Rizzo", "And then with sales, you had a very strong quarter. It seems like things accelerated and you no longer have the FX headwind. Are you -- would that suggest that maybe towards the end of the year again that you might be -- not be raising guidance at this point, but that -- I mean it just seems like that would suggest that things aren\u2019t going to continue at this path and this quarter was more of an outlier. I was just wondering if, given the sales growth you have, no longer the FX headwind, if perhaps sales could come in higher than what you\u2019re currently anticipating.", "Garry Ridge", "If we thought that, we would change our guidance. So, we're comfortable where we are now. It's like a game of golf. It's not over till 18 holes are played and we feel the first part of our year was -- put us on a strong point and if we feel later in the year it continues then we will do what we should do and that's we'll update people with good knowledge and good information on the way the market is.", "Daniel Rizzo", "And then finally with the new building in the UK, is that I mean going to follow a similar path as the one in San Diego in terms of cost and timing? I mean I know you said you wanted to take care of everything this year, but I was wondering if we can expect a similar result as what we saw last year.", "Garry Ridge", "It'll be smaller than the building in San Diego. We think the total costs, I think, Jay mentioned was in the vicinity of 13 million US. So, it's about 5 or so million less than we invested here in San Diego. We haven't yet obviously found or made any moves on acquiring a building. We've been looking at a number of opportunities in the Milton Keynes area and we'll be working on that, but this will be somewhere in the vicinity of 18 months. As a project, we believe once we do find the building and we acquire it, we\u2019ll be able to update our investors a little more on the exact total investment.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli and Company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Just following up on the previous question, if sales are going to be lower for the -- sales growth are going to be lower for the full year than they were in the first quarter, is that due to seasonality or are there other reasons why you would expect slower rate for the full year?", "Garry Ridge", "We have very real consolidated seasonality and that's because we're spread across so many geographies. It's summer in Australia and it's winter here. One offsets the other. Southern Hemisphere, northern hemisphere, but these sales vary quarter to quarter really around our promotional activities, what -- where retailers and distributors are promoting and in what geographies. So if you've looked past -- back at our past, you\u2019ll see that we do have some fluctuations quarter to quarter, but they're really not driven by season. They're more driven by events that we do have some influence over.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. So that brings me to the question about China, the fact that your sales were down 9%. You talked about timing of promotions or timing of order, correctly. Or is it dependent on your promotional level? Do you expect those orders to show up in the second quarter or do you need to have additional promotions in order to have new orders?", "Garry Ridge", "No. We believe that you'll see a major part of those orders show up in the second quarter. We actually ran a fairly large dealer event in China, just near the end of the first quarter. A lot of those orders won't ship until the second quarter. So, we expect to deliver a pretty good top line growth in China over the year. So, I think that we\u2019re fairly comfortable as we continue to build our business in China.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And then I was wondering regarding -- you said that you need to build up the distribution of some of your new specialist product lines. Why aren't they using the same distribution network as a multi-use? I guess I don't quite understand that.", "Garry Ridge", "I'm sorry. Yes. They are using the same distribution network. We just haven't released them through all that distribution. So, we don't take everything to every trade channel in every country at the same time. It's really a phasing of where it's appropriate and what other activities we have going on around at that time. So it's not taking them to new distribution. It's really executing distribution in trade channels that we currently sell our blue and yellow can in, but we make a deliberate decision on when to go in certain geographies.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And then lastly if I may, looking at your 2025 targets, I understand the WD-40 multi-use target. I understand the specialist for the client target. The other 70 million, is that expected to come from products that are not currently in your portfolio?", "Garry Ridge", "No. It's going to come from products that are currently in our portfolio. Those products currently add up to about $53 million worth of revenue and in our investor presentation, on page 5 that should be up on our website now, if it\u2019s not, it will be soon, it shows that they are currently at that 63 million and moving on to 70 million by 2025. And the products in there are THREE-IN-ONE, WD-40 BIKE, GT85, Spot Shot, NoVac in Australia, Solvol and Lava and 1001 in the UK.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. So the difference between this and the specialist product is that the specialist products are more or less the multi-use, but just aren\u2019t different type of applications?", "Garry Ridge", "Different applications and different types, for example, in our specialist products, we have products that are -- our new line of greasers, we have a line of degreasers. Then, we have a line of specific maintenance products like our penetrant, our silicon, our white lithium grease, our spray gel. So the specialist products are aimed at the heavy end uses or the trades end uses and we already have a significant portfolio of products wearing the specialist uniform.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today's conference call and ask you please disconnect your lines."]}

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today's call, Ms. Wendy Kelley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed.", "Wendy Kelley", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. On our call today are WD-40 Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Garry Ridge, and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jay Rembolt.", "In addition to the financial information presented on today's call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, earnings press release, and Form 10-Q for the period ending February 28, 2018. These documents are available on our Investor Relations Web-site at investor.wd40company.com.

Good day everyone and welcome to our conference call. Today we reported net sales of $101.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, reflecting an increase of 5% from the second quarter of last fiscal year and the first $100 million quarter in the Company's history.", "Net income for the second quarter was $14.8 million compared to $12.4 million in the second quarter of last fiscal year, an increase of 20% period-over-period. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.87 for the same period last fiscal year, a new record for the Company.", "Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted our sales in the second quarter but we are seeing solid organic growth thus far this fiscal year. Our global net sales for the first half of the year have grown by 7% on a reported basis and by 4% on a constant currency basis.", "Now let's start with a discussion about our strategic initiatives. As most of you will recall, our long-term revenue target is to drive consolidated net sales to approximately $700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025. In support of this target and as a result of the savings that we are going to realize from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have decided to invest an additional $1 million in brand-building this fiscal year.", "In addition, we are currently evaluating additional brand building investments for next fiscal year. This investment will focus on two main areas of our core strategies of making the end-user aware and making our products easy to buy. It will first be used to fast-track our global digital presence and to increase the volume of Multi-Use Product sampling programs to targeted end-user groups in countries identified as key growth opportunities.", "We acknowledge that our anticipated 2025 targets are aspirational, but as Richard Branson once said, 'If your dreams don't scare you, they are too small.' In light of that, we know the opportunities are abundant but focus is a gift, and if we keep our focus in the right places, we believe we can be successful.", "Let's take a look now at the strategic initiatives, number one being grow WD-40 Multi-Use Product. Our most important strategic initiative is to take the blue and yellow can with a little red top for more people in more places and have them use it more frequently. In order to achieve that target of $530 million in Multi-Use Product revenue, we need to continue our strategy of building Multi-Use Product across all markets through both geographic expansion as well as through innovation.", "In the second quarter, global sales of Multi-Use Product were $78.9 million, reflecting an increase of 3% compared to the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product are up 6% compared to last year.", "In the second quarter, we launched our newest product, WD-40 Flexible, which is the European version of WD-40 EZ Reach, featuring an innovative flexible straw. We are being very deliberate about how we are staging the release of this new product. We have begun distribution of the product in trade-focused channels in Italy and we are happy with the initial results. We expect to add distribution in France in the third quarter of this fiscal year.", "The second strategic initiative is to grow the WD-40 Specialist product line. Our target under this initiative is to grow WD-40 Specialist product line through continued geographic expansion as well as by developing new products and product categories.", "Over the last several years, we've developed a robust pipeline of WD-40 Specialist products. Now our focus needs to be on building market awareness and distribution for these new initiatives and innovations in order to achieve our stated target of $100 million in revenue by the end of 2025.", "In the second quarter, global sales of WD-40 Specialist was $7.5 million, reflecting an increase of 38% compared to the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, net sales of WD-40 Specialist were up 33% compared to last year. We are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for WD-40 Specialist. However, there will be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building of distribution, and various other factors that are common while you build out a new product line.", "Strategic initiative number three is to broaden the product and revenue base. Our goal under this initiative is to leverage the recognized strengths of WD-40 Company to derive revenue from existing brands as well as new sources of revenues and products.", "Strategic initiative number three includes maintenance products like 3-IN-ONE, WD-40 Bike, GT85, but also includes brands such as Spot Shot and Lava in the Americas, 1001 in EMEA, and no vac and Solvol in Asia Pacific. We believe we can continue to nurture and grow the products included under this initiative and expect their combined revenue to reach approximately $70 million by the end of fiscal 2025.", "In the second quarter, global sales of products under this initiative were $10.4 million, reflecting an increase of 6% compared to the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date sales of products included under this initiative are up 3% compared to last year.", "Strategic initiative number four is to attract, develop and retain outstanding tribe members. Our goal under this initiative is to attract, develop and retain talented tribe members and grow the tribe member engagement to greater than 95%. During the second quarter, we asked our 464 tribe members to participate in a biannual employee engagement survey.", "I'm very happy to report that our global employee engagement index score increased by 50 basis points from two years ago to 93.3%. In fact, 99% of our tribe answered that they love to tell people that they work for WD-40 Company. And 98% of our tribe told us they feel their opinions and values are a good fit with the WD-40 Company culture.", "We cultivate high employee engagement by creating a culture based on care, candor, accountability and responsibility, guided by our values and nourished by learning. Our employee engagement score is a reflection of that way of life.", "Additionally, I'm happy to share with you that during the second quarter we located and purchased a new building to house our U.K.-based tribe members. The new facility is located only 3 miles from our current Milton Keynes office. We are currently in the early stages of renovating the space and we expect to move the tribe to this new building in the spring of 2019.", "Strategic initiative number five is operational excellence. Our goal under this initiative is best summarized by one of the core values here at WD-40 Company, making it better than it is today. We measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative by executing against our 55/30/25 business model and by making improvements to processes and systems while safeguarding our brands. Protecting the 55/30/25 business model is a priority for us.", "Volatile commodity prices, including those for oil and steel, have the ability to impact our gross margins over the short-term, but over the long-term our 55/30/25 business model must remain intact. Accordingly, we are making some proactive price adjustments in the coming months to ensure our gross margins will remain within our target ranges over the long term.", "That completes the update on the strategic initiatives. So, let's move on to the details of our second quarter sales results, starting with the Americas. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated net sales were $101.3 million in the second quarter, up $4.7 million or 5% in the second quarter of last year.", "Translation of foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, total net sales would have been 97 million, an increase of just under 1% compared to last year. This is what we refer to as translation-related impacts and it affects reported sales from Canada, Australia, China, and the EMEA segment. Transaction-related impacts in EMEA were insignificant this quarter. So, in total, changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by about $4.3 million in the second quarter, and obviously that update was on the global results.", "Now, let's take a look at what happened in the individual segments. We'll start with the Americas. Net sales in the Americas, which include the United States, Latin America and Canada, were relatively flat in the second quarter compared to last year of $45 million. Year-to-date net sales in the Americas were up 4% compared to last year.", "Sales of maintenance products increased by 1% in the Americas, primarily due to higher sales of maintenance products in the U.S. and Latin America. Maintenance products sales in the United States increased 1% in the second quarter, primarily due to a 22% increase in sales of WD-40 Specialist due to new distribution for products that were launched in the early fiscal year of 2018. In addition, maintenance products sales in Latin America were up 2% in the second quarter, primarily due to increased sales of both WD-40 Specialist and 3-IN-ONE.", "These maintenance products sales increases were offset by a 2% decrease in the sales in Canada during the quarter due to the timing of some promotional activities. As a reminder, our maintenance products exclude our homecare and cleaning products. Sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas decreased 7% in the second quarter as compared to the same period of last year.", "Now on to EMEA, net sales in EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, increased to $39.6 million in the second quarter, up 9% from last year. Year-to-date, net sales in EMEA are up 12% compared to last year. EMEA's reported results in the second quarter were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA decreased 1% compared to last year.", "As you know, we sell into EMEA through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors. Reported consolidated sales in our EMEA direct markets, which accounted for 70% of the region, increased 19% during the quarter to US$27.6 million.", "It's also helpful to look at our results in local currencies in which we conduct sales transactions in our direct markets. In pound sterling based markets, sales increased 5% in the quarter, primarily due to the growth driven by higher levels of promotional activities in the region that are focusing on WD-40 Smart Straw and WD-40 Specialist.", "In euro-based direct markets, sales increased by 1% in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of customer orders and the continued growth of our base business. Also contributing to the overall sales increase in these direct markets was higher sales of the WD-40 Specialist product line.", "Now let's turn to our EMEA distributor markets, which accounted for 30% of EMEA sales during the quarter. In reported currency, our EMEA distributor market sales decreased 8% in the second quarter to 12 million. These declines were driven by the timing of customer orders.", "Now on to Asia-Pacific, consolidated net sales in Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, China, and other countries in the region, increased to 16.6 million in the second quarter, up 9% from last year. Year-to-date, net sales in Asia-Pacific are up 5% compared to last year.", "In Australia, net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.5 million in the second quarter, up 13% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on these results. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 300,000 or 7% period-to-period. This increase in sales was driven primarily by the successful promotional activities and expanded distribution of WD-40 Specialist product line in the region.", "Our Asian distributor market net sales were 8.1 million in the quarter, up 3% compared to last year. This increase in sales was primarily attributed to a higher level of promotion activities in the region, in particular in Taiwan and Thailand. Our Asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency, since we sell our products in U.S. dollars in the region.", "In China, net sales in U.S. dollars were $4.1 million in the second quarter, up 19% compared to last year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact on these results. On a constant currency basis, sales would have increased by 400,000 or 12% period-to-period. This sales increase was primarily due to a promotional program that we conducted during the second quarter of the year. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities in China, although we expect a lot of volatility along the way due to the timing of promotional programs, the building out of distribution, shifting economic patterns, and the varying industrial activities.", "That's it for me for now. I'll now turn over to Jay who will continue with the review of the financials.", "Jay Rembolt", "Thank you, Garry. First, let's review the 55/30/25 business model. These are the long-term targets we use to guide our business. As you may recall, the 55 represents gross margin, which we target to be at 55% of net sales. The 30 represents our cost of doing business, which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Our goal is to drive our cost of doing business over time toward that 30%. And then finally, the 25 represents EBITDA.", "First, we'll look at our gross margin, or the 55. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 55.1% compared to 56.4% last year. Changes in major input costs, which primarily include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, negatively impacted our margin by 120 basis points.", "As you know, crude oil is one of the primary feedstocks of our petroleum-based specialty chemicals. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 80 basis points because the average cost of crude oil that flowed through our cost of goods sold was higher in the second quarter compared to last year.", "Also contributing negatively to our margin by 40 basis points was the increased cost associated with our aerosol cans. In addition, there were a variety of other costs which combined to negatively impact gross margin by 30 basis points. These miscellaneous impacts include increases in other non-oil and can-related cost of goods sold and other impacts from sales mix changes. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 20 basis points primarily due to higher warehousing and inbound freight costs, mostly in the Americas segment.", "These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by select sales price increases which we implemented in EMEA and Asia-Pacific over the last 12 months, which positively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points.", "I'd like to remind you that despite the recent cost increases we've seen for crude oil and aerosol cans, our gross margin target of 55% remains unchanged. Now recently we've experienced rising input costs which would put pressure on our cost of goods in all three of our trading blocks. These economic factors have made it necessary for us to review our pricing structure and implement price increases in most of our markets. We continue to be focused and deliberate in managing our business so that we can maintain gross margin at a level that is above our target of 55% over the long-term.", "Now, I'll address the 30 or our cost of doing business. In the second quarter, our cost of doing business was approximately 34% compared to 35% last year. Revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving our long-term 30% target. In the second quarter of this year, our reported revenue increase positively impacted our cost of doing business percentage.", "For the second quarter, 78% of our cost of doing business came from three areas; people costs or the investment we make in our tribe; the investments we make in marketing, advertising and promotion, as a percent of sales our advertising and promotion investment was 5.1% in the second quarter; and then finally, freight costs, the cost to get our products to our customers.", "In the second quarter, our SG&A increased 2%, primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1 million compared to the prior year period. Various other items also contributed to increased SG&A costs, including increased depreciation expense and general office overhead costs associated with our new building in San Diego, increased freight costs, increased professional service costs. These increases were more than offset by decreased people-related costs, primarily related to earned incentive compensation, and decreased new product development cost this year as compared to last.", "While our objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30% of net sales, we will continue to make necessary investments in support of our strategic initiative that of operational excellence. As Garry mentioned earlier, we've decided to invest an additional $1 million in advertising and promotion during this fiscal year in support of brand development and we are currently evaluating an additional A&P investment next year as well. Accordingly, we anticipate these investments will impact our cost of doing business results for the near-term. However, we continue to expect to move closer to our target of 30% over the long-term as revenues grow.", "This brings us to EBITDA, the last of our 55/30/25 measures. EBITDA was 21% of net sales for both the second quarter of this year and last year. That completes the discussion on our business model for the quarter.", "Now, I'll discuss a couple of other items worth noting. One, the provision for income tax was 18.7% in the second quarter compared to 32.8% last year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the favorable impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. which became effective for us in the second quarter of this year. In addition, the effective income tax rate for the second quarter of last year was higher due to an adjustment associated with tax impacts from certain unrealized foreign currency exchange losses. Since our fiscal year ends on August 31, we will apply a blended statutory income tax rate of just under 26% for fiscal year 2018, which is about 9 percentage points below that of the prior year.", "We also recorded two discrete items during the year related to the U.S. tax reform, a benefit from the one-time re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as a tax charge from the mandatory one-time total tax on unremitted foreign earnings. These two items essentially offset one another and when combined had little impact to the Company's effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.", "It is important to note that both of these items were recorded as provisional amounts, which means that they are management's best estimates at this time. These amounts are subject to change during the re-measurement period of up to one year after the enactment of the U.S. tax reform based on recent guidance issued by the SEC.", "Based on our initial analysis of the U.S. tax reform, but subject to revisions of our provisional amounts, we expect that our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be in the 22% to 23% range.", "Net income for the second quarter was $14.8 million compared to $12.4 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase of 20%. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of about $900,000 on the translation of our consolidated results this quarter. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by 13% compared to last year.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $1.05 in the second quarter compared to $0.87 in the same period last year, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 14 million shares from 14.1 million shares a year ago.", "Now, a word about capital allocation, our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing and long-term growth while providing strong returns to our stockholders. We typically target our maintenance CapEx of between 1% and 2% of net sales, but as previously discussed, in addition to our normal maintenance CapEx, we anticipate making an investment of approximately $15 million to buy and renovate the office building to house our U.K.-based tribe members.", "At the end of the second quarter, we were able to find and purchase an office building in the Milton Keynes area for $7.4 million. The remainder of the estimated $15 million investment will be used to renovate and equip this new building over the next 12 to 18 months. Our U.K. tribe members are very excited and are expected to relocate to the new building in the next fiscal year.", "We continue to return capital to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. On March 20, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share, payable April 30 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 20. And based on today's closing price of $133, the annualized dividend yield is 1.6%.", "During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 61,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $7.5 million under our current $75 million share repurchase plan, which was approved by the Board in June 2016. At the end of our second fiscal quarter, we had $32.5 million remaining under the plan.", "With that, let's turn to the fiscal year 2018 guidance. We are updating our guidance to reflect the updated foreign currency exchange rates, higher input costs, our effective tax rate that's been revised based on the new tax legislation, as well as additional investments we are making to our advertising and promotions this year.", "Net sales growth is projected to be between 7% and 9%, with net sales expected to be between $407 million and $415 million. Gross margin for the full fiscal year is expected to be near 55%. And with the additional investments we tend to make, advertising and promotion investment is projected to be near 6% of net sales. Net income is projected to be between $56.6 million and $57.5 million. And diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $4.07 and $4.14 on an estimated 13.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.", "This guidance includes the anticipated impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but it does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and assumes that foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices will remain close to current levels for the remainder of 2018.", "And that completes the financial overview. Now I'll turn it back over to Garry.", "Garry Ridge", "Thank you, Jay. In summary, what did you hear from us on this call today? You heard that today we reported record net sales of $101.3 million and the first ever $100 million quarter in the Company history. You heard that year-to-date we've seen solid net sales growth with a 7% growth on a reported basis and 4% growth on a constant currency basis. You heard that global sales of WD-40 Specialist grew 38% during the quarter. You heard that today we reported record EPS of $1.05.", "You heard that our reported results were favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and that we intend to invest an additional $1 million during this fiscal year and more next year in support of global brand development. You heard that the global employee engagement survey score increased 50 basis points from two years ago to 93.3%.", "You heard that we're making some proactive price adjustments to ensure our gross margin remains in line with our 55/30/25 business model, given the increase in commodity costs. And you heard that we've updated our fiscal year 2018 guidance to reflect updated foreign currency exchange rates, higher input cost, and revised effective tax rate, as well as the additional investments we are making to our advertising and promotional investments this year.", "So, as usual, in closing I'd like to share a quote with you today from Charles Schulz, and it is, 'In life, it's not where you go, it's who you travel with'. That's for our tribe. Thank you for joining us today and we'll be pleased now to open the conference call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question.", "Liam Burke", "Garry, could you give us some color on how EZ Reach has been doing domestically or in the Americas, however you want to catch it?", "Garry Ridge", "EZ Reach domestically has been meeting our expectation. We don't break out the individual sales, but certainly it's a new product that the end users have embraced, and currently in fact you'll see quite a number of displays of it in major stores around the U.S. as we enter our promotional period with it. And we're very comfortable that we've now rolled it out in Italy and France and we've also rolled it out in Australia. I think we talked about that last quarter. And it will be featured actually on TV in Australia around the next month or so during a big motor racing carnival.", "Liam Burke", "Is that promotion tied to the incremental $1 million that you announced on the call or is the additional brand-building investment separate from EZ Reach?", "Garry Ridge", "It's separate. The $1 million this year and what we'll end up investing next year is very focused, Liam. We have done a very deep dive on the digital e-commerce space and just concluded about a month ago a global workshop on the opportunities, and the first place that this investment will go will be to enhance our global digital presence both in the 'make it easy to buy' and the 'make our end-user aware' categories that will include enhancement of education or information in assets with things like YouTube, optimizing our Web-sites globally, and optimizing our search engine optimization and program. So, the majority of it will go there. The other will go to targeted sampling programs in some of our larger opportunity markets, for example, Mexico China, India, et cetera.", "Liam Burke", "Okay, great. Thank you, Garry. Jay, on the cost of doing business front, the SG&A piece of your business was down sequentially. Could you give us a little color on what happened there?", "Jay Rembolt", "Some of that came from the lower incentive compensation. It was really the bigger impact on the lowering.", "Liam Burke", "Okay, that's great. Thanks, Jay, and thanks, Garry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Rizzo", "You mentioned the weakness with distributors in EMEA was due to timing issues. Would that suggest that there is going to be kind of a snapback in the third quarter here, that it's just flow lumpiness from quarter to quarter?", "Garry Ridge", "I don't know whether it will be in the third quarter, but our distributor business over time has ebbs and flows. We would see that we will be on track for the year and we have no anticipation that distributor business will be off for the year. So, it's nothing that we are particularly concerned about.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then you mentioned having the two price increases to offset the higher input cost. I was wondering, what the lag is between when that's realized versus what we're announcing today. I mean, it usually take 90 to 120 days or is it less than that, or just any color that you can provide?", "Garry Ridge", "Yes, the price increases, some of them have already gone into effect. In other markets like the United States, they go into effect on June 1. So we did announce them to our customers about a month ago. So, I think we should see the margin stabilize. I don't think we're going to have a huge tail or headwind. I think we should line up pretty well as we come through the third quarter.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. And then just on the goals for 2025, you mentioned 70 million in net sales from initiative number three. And you did allude to M&A. But I was wondering if M&A is necessary to meet that goal or is it more about just developing new brands organically?", "Garry Ridge", "We have no M&A plans in our 2025 goal. That 70 million that we are talking about, in aggregate right now that group of products is doing I think in our chart 63 million. So it's not a huge growth. We will see some fall-off from some of the household products that are not included in there and that fall-off will be offset by the growth of the products that are in there. Particularly the 3-IN-ONE brand and WD-40 Bike are the two areas that will offset that.", "Daniel Rizzo", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "I was wondering if Jay's answer to the previous question on SG&A was the reason why revenues in the second quarter were up 5%, but up 7% year to date, so the growth rate slowed in the second quarter, while net income was up 20% for the quarter but 14% year-to-date, so we have kind of a disconnect there.", "Garry Ridge", "No. Our incentive programs are an annualized incentive program, so it adjusts as we go through the year, but we don't pay quarterly commissions, if that's what you were alluding to. It's just a matter of us truing up as the year progresses to see what we think our annual cost of our growth reward program will be.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "So then what helped the net income line, since it grew 20% in the second quarter?", "Jay Rembolt", "A big portion of that came from the tax benefit.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. Okay, totally missed that.", "Jay Rembolt", "We got a significant benefit in the quarter that really had a big impact on earnings.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, thanks. I should have figured that one out. You are anticipating the 2018 tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. Is that a good number to use for 2019 and the out years?", "Jay Rembolt", "We haven't finalized the 2019 and the out years, but we would expect that it might drop a little bit lower than that.", "Garry Ridge", "And the reason being is this year is a blended rate. Our fiscal year is September to August. So we've got the period from September through to December at the old rate and the balance of the year at the new rate. So, that's why we would expect it to be a slightly different rate in the full fiscal, in our full fiscal year of 2019.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, thanks. And looking at the gross margin, let me rephrase this, can you estimate the percent increase in raw material cost versus the percent increase you got on your selling prices for the first half of this year?", "Jay Rembolt", "We didn't do the math on that, but we should be able to do it from the \u2013 we had the amount of impact on margin, so we had a positive benefit of 40 basis points from the price increases, offset by or partially offsetting that much more significant increase in the input costs.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Was that the 70 basis points?", "Jay Rembolt", "Yes, the input costs in total were 120 basis points. So we had a negative impact of 120 basis points offset by a positive impact from the price increases of 40 basis points.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, yes, I see. So you had the crude plus the cans, all right. And then, can you help me understand, what is the difference between your EZ Reach that you are introducing in the U.S. and the Flexible in Europe, and why aren't they the same?", "Garry Ridge", "They are exactly the same. We just call them a different name. Flexible translates better in Italian and Spanish than EZ Reach does. So it's exactly the same product with a slightly different description.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. I thought that you had found something that worked better than the EZ Reach.", "Garry Ridge", "No, it's just the naming.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "All right, okay. And then lastly, on the EMEA distribution sales down, you said was the timing. Was it also a question of inventory built at the distribution level that they needed to get to?", "Garry Ridge", "No. No, it wasn't. Our distributor business globally, whether it would be distributors in Asia-Pacific or in EMEA or in Latin America, because it's a few large distributors, it's not necessarily as smooth as in other areas. So, we do have some quarters where it's up, some quarters where it's down, but overall, the trend continues to be a growth trend, unless you have an unusual event, like we had a couple of years ago in Russia, and we would call that out and talk about that. But there is no unusual event, it's just a timing thing.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay.", "Jay Rembolt", "And the market itself is up 5% year-to-date.", "Garry Ridge", "Yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our allotted time for questions. We thank you for your participation on today's conference call and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}
