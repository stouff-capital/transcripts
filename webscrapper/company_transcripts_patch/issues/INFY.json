While revenue grew by 7.2%, the headcount growth was just 1.9%.", "Our operating margin for the year was above midpoint of our guided during this 23 to 25 at 24.3%.

As you know the subcontractor expenses have driven primarily by utilization levels and onsite talent demand.", "Our operation margin in Q4 was 24.7% which increased sequentially by 40 basis points currency movements helped the margin by 20 basis points which was fully offset by a drop in utilization and price realization.

The corresponding write-down in the investment value of Panaya in the standalone financial statement of Infosys Limited is $90 million.", "Coming to operating margin guidance for fiscal '19, we guide operating margins in the range of 22% to 24%. This is primarily an account of focused investments in digital to leverage digital opportunity in under invested areas, enhancing our investments in U.S. talent models further to foolproof our future business, revitalizing sales for swapping market opportunities and repurposing of talent.", "At the same time as in the last year, we continue our relentless focus on productivity, operational efficiency and cost optimization while focusing on digital growth.", "With that, we open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we can now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I wanted ask about margin's first. I think why the revision lower, and I think there been a couple of revisions lower over the last couple of years. Do you feel like it's taking them down far enough?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga here. I think if you look at last year, we gave guided 23 to 25, we ended up at 24.3 higher than the midpoint. I think one of the -- I want to emphasize that we'll continue our relentless focus on all the parameters that I talked about as well as the productivity and the cost optimizations.", "What we have done really is, as part of our business review that we did. We looked at areas -- digital areas especially where we need to invest more to leverage the opportunities point one. Second, on the U.S. talent model, we have planned for additional investments so that the growth is not compromised in the United States.", "Third, we've also looked at revitalization of sales to see especially in respect of -- pursuit of large [sales] [ph] and conversation of the [sale] [ph] and also repurposing couple of our talent -- some of our talent in the digital area. While I think what we will do is, as the year progresses there is a range they have given, but as the year progresses, we'll certainly -- we will be able to provide more color on how we are progressing on those four investments. But nevertheless, our relentless focus on the optimization and productivity will continue.", "Joseph Foresi", "So let me ask kind of a different way. Do you feel like you're at your natural long-term level of margins giving next year. And if not what utilization obviously have gone up, so I'm wondering what leverage you have to continue to maintain the margin level that you have.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "I think we are confident of retaining the guidance range to the current 22% before we're confident about it because we also believe that some of these investments are required for leveraging the digital growth in the near term. So we're confident of that range in the medium term.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then, the last one for me, can you give us some color on how fast Brazil grew for you and what your expectations for the growth rate in that business are going forward? Thanks.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. In terms of digital, we started to really track and look at it very carefully for this fiscal '18 process the disclosure for us.", "In Q4, digital has grown 3.6% over Q3, with that sort of a trend, it's something that we would push for. We see the market certainly growing at a large level. Overall, digital number of 2.8 billion we have attracted and look for this carefully in fiscal '18, we start to see comps in fiscal '19 as quotas roll in.", "We also see the overall addressable market for this business is somewhere in the range of 180 billion to 200 billion and that market is growing quite strongly. So we expect this to be -- one of the growth drivers for us in the future.", "Joseph Foresi", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anantha Narayan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thank you and good evening everyone. I have a couple of questions as well and the first one is to Ranga, on the margin issue. So Ranga, the new -- you spoke about those investments being the reason for ratcheting down your margin range. Are there any one-off elements in those investments or should we sort of expect such investments to continue just given your size and growth.", "And if the latter than what sort of top-line growth would be required to get your margins back to the 23% to 25% range.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "This is Ranga here. I think, sorry, you were saying something.", "Anantha Narayan", "Yes. Sorry, just to clarify this question was related to more from a three, four year perspective rather than just for FY'19?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Yes. I was saying earlier we ended the year at 24.3 and a Q4 was robust at 24.7. And the guidance that we have given 22 to 24 finally takes into account, so the investment but one-off big ticket single investment that we need to do. It is not like that it is not really a chunky investment. We're looking at all the prop accounts and also the service lines where we have more potential to grow primarily investing in the capabilities, primary investing in certain IP that were required to drive the digital growth. It's not really a large term investment that they're looking at.", "And of course, this will be very gradual and progressive during the year depending upon how those investments pan out during the year. Certainly will have -- it will have necessary impact on the margin. But at this point in time what they have assumed is really all these investments that we're going to make throughout the year.", "But, of course, we are conscious of the fact that for the overall EPS and earnings growth the margin date has to be more than be compensated by the revenue growth to retain the EPS growth, I think that in the medium term. So I think we are very conscious of that fact. I think this is a balance between how we need to really look at focusing invest in digital areas where we feel that there is a large opportunity that we need to leverage.", "Anantha Narayan", "And on the second part of that question Ranga, over the next three or four years, would single-digit growth suffice for you to manage your margins at the existing levels?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Well, I think one of the factors that I would like to emphasize the market levers that we're looking at here is not necessarily the cost optimization lever alone. One of the things is, the digital revenue that we've talked about 25.5% for the year is coming at higher price points and not only higher price points it is also delivering us better gross margin than the core IT services.", "So, our emphasis or endeavor would be to drive that price point and gross margins in digital better during the year. And that is something that we're also working on. So our overall objective is that a combination of faster growth in digital services, which will be at -- which could be at higher price point and gross margin need to offset the other impact of the margin growth on the EPS.", "To answer your question, I think we're comfortable with this range and we will watch during the year. This is the range that we have made certain investment assumptions to drive growth and we're comfortable that even with this kind of brand broadly the earnings in the medium term need to be protected through multiple levers including digital profitability.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thanks Ranga. And then, just one more question, just to Salil. Salil on this, I just look at it on paper both Panaya and Skava seem to fulfill some of the criteria among those four elements of your strategy that you laid out. So maybe you could just detail for us the reasons why you decided to get rid of that.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi, Ananth. This is Salil. I think the approach we laid out in the four elements with agile, digital and then the core. And we have still have people in localization. Those are the go forward strategic elements we can drive to building out a digital services revenue stream. The two-prong building that I talked about before. And within that we emphasize what we have in our platform basis, for example NIA, on McCamish, what we have in insurance are certainly products such as Finacle and Edge.", "Panaya and Skava, the approach we have taken is, we initiated the process evaluating identification of a potential buyer for it. There are certain criteria internally that we looked at that we would need for all of our businesses to fit for them scale. And there were some of those criteria that Panaya and Skava did not meet in this time.", "The commitment we have with our clients is to ensure that there is two product we have here, something that the current clients you are working in and clients in the future leaving this, we remain committed to this. And off the approach we are taking in terms of a strategic review increased.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thank you, Salil and good luck for the new fiscal year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi. Thank you. I had two questions if I could. The first is, is also on margin, but I wanted to just understand the strategy as it relates to onsite and offshore. In the March quarter. your offshore effort and revenues actually went up a little bit, but I would assume pursuant to some of the strategy elements you laid out that in fact what are the implications the margins as you pursue more digital activities given the waiting of onsite and offshore and then I'm a follow up please.", "Pravin Rao", "Hi, Keith. I will take that question. I think one way to look at it is really segregate our onsite revenue into two components. One is the digital and non-digital. And even if you look at the overall company, they're looking at 25.5%. And when we looked at the gross margin of these 25.5% of the business, it is higher than the quarter IT services. And it is higher than the -- of course higher than the company's gross margin.", "So, we -- the area of course, digital is not a homogeneous business makes sense because it has got a very wide range of services there. But, with the pricing discipline that we have we are confident of achieving better price point in the digital revenue. Even if it is higher onsite component, at this stage based on what we see, we do believe that the gross margin things will be higher than the core IT services.", "So, to answer the question, the emphasis on digital, revenue growth not necessarily mean that those revenues because of higher onset component are coming at gross margin. As today that is not the case. So I think the primary focus of the margin is really to drive further digital without diluting the gross margins that we are getting in digital to better price point. And at the same time make sure that we are leveraging the opportunities across our top accounts. And in [Technical Difficulty].", "Keith Bachman", "Capital allocation versus M&A and you've laid out a strategy where you're paying out 70% of your free cash flow and then also going to pay a special dividend. With that said, emphasis like a lot of the Indian based IT providers -- service providers rather is facing structural challenges. And if you look at Accenture over the last five to seven years has put a heavy emphasis on M&A to rebalance or remix the portfolio. And it just seems to me the risk you're running is weighted towards the capital allocation is not being able to remix your portfolio at a rate that allow you to either maintain or accelerate your revenue growth.", "So while this is a tricky balance admittedly it just wood on the surface seem to suggest that perhaps you should be weighing more to the M&A side. So if you could just speak to the capital allocation strategy that you laid out today and what emphasis that you're going to place over on M&A over the next 12 to 18 months to try to help rebalance your portfolio.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. I think in terms of the capital allocation policy, there are two components to it. First is up to 70% of our free cash flow from our ongoing cash generation. And then, second one being 2 billion on what we have on the balance sheet today. [indiscernible] quite a significant amount on the balance sheet in addition to the ongoing cash generation that we will continue to drive into.", "We developed today at least a view -- a first view of what are the opportunities in the M&A space. And we are proactively looking to see what are those we could leverage into those digital service architecture around the definitions that we've built internally for our future scale up.", "You also saw the announcement today of the acquisition that we did what we call the experience space of digital related to the digital creative agency. We want to continue to do those types of acquisitions and indeed across that digital landscape that can help us position us in this transformation.", "Our revenue also conscious that we have a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet and that even toward the capital allocation policy which relates go through the ongoing cash generation and what it's been today on the balance sheet.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Thank you and best of luck too.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Thanks. Can you talk a bit more about some of those investment buckets as you mentioned 3 or 4 some of your earlier interviews? And then, in that respect, maybe you can talk through a big picture perspective about strategy for the next three to four years. Are we going to see any deviation from what we've seen in the past maybe a couple of pointers here could be helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Salil Parekh", "On the investment buckets we purchased dividend planning for our fiscal '19 relate to investments in finance. First, building out digital capabilities, so turning in an investment in scaling up creating, recruiting and in general giving utilization benefits to building the digital capability.", "Second is to expanding same capability and allowing that to become more focused in the growth area. Growth in sectors, geographies and also in the service offers.", "The third related to our localization approach in the first instance in fiscal '19 investments in localization in the U.S. went for talent, those were that building up delivery centre capabilities and training capabilities within the U.S.", "And the fourth related to refactoring and reskilling of our employees and that cost as it relates to aligning to our future direction namely on the digital and cloud platforms that they are working towards.", "Turning to the second question on direction for the next three or four years as you described. It centered around [indiscernible], the first is the scale up of our digital business, which is today 2.8 billion and growing rapidly.", "The second is to energize of course with AI and automation. And third relates to giving our employees for the future discipline roadmap. And then, fourth relates to expanding localization in the U.S. and in other geography that we operate that direction is there. That is the actual we expect now for the go forward period and we expect to sit with it in the coming years.", "Moshe Katri", "Great. And then, just final question, this is a big picture question. There's a lot of optimism, I guess among the sell side, the buy side that we may see that up tick in demand this year. Based on conversations that you're having out here with clients, are we kind of getting there or at this point this is still kind of up in the air just given the fragility of the environment and given the geopolitical uncertainty out there. Thanks a lot.", "Salil Parekh", "If I understand then, within those client demand and optimism, what we see today, there are segments where there's significant optimism in group, for example and energy utility in a geography, for example, the European geography for us are even more [indiscernible] than rest of the world.", "Overall, in the areas you defined basically service architecture. There's significant optimism and quite a lot of opportunity for growth and those areas become skewed for us and then starts to see the return that is the area where we see the most dynamic growth and opportunity in the market and hopefully we leverage that as we execute on it.", "Moshe Katri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually two questions. One is from the direction of M&A, your latest acquisition seems to be taking your M&A in a different direction especially when coupled with the exits that we are looking for with Panaya and Skava. Could you run us through your outlook for how you're looking at M&A going forward?", "And my second question, again, coming back to the margin arguments, Ranga, if you could just run us through at the lower end of your margin guidance, higher is the margin guide. What are the key elements that really contribute to the margins? I understand that you probably reached a certain limit on utilization expansion, we've already seen headcount additions pick up. So if you could just break it down into utilization pricing and then the investment in fact on your margins for the next 10 months that must be very handful?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga. Here on the margin front, I think in the last year we guided 23% to 25%, we reduced by 1% and we said primarily on account of rupee and to some extent the U.S. talent model. However, we delivered 24.3%.", "Now, this time, the primary reason for guiding in 22% to 24% is to tap the opportunities in digital and some of the investments that we need to make to tap those opportunities as well as in reproposing the sales engine for -- some of the last two pursuits. Third of course is the additional investment that we need to make in the United States.", "These are three principal pieces. Now, the way we are -- we do not want to kind of totally exclude these things I know from our planning standpoint. We will see how these investments pan out during the year and maybe after Q1 to Q2, we'll get a better perspective, but we want to make sure that we keep the range at 20% to 24%, so that no necessary investments, if you have to make and as we made during the year, we will address demanding aspect.", "Salil Parekh", "On the M&A question, I think with the approach we want to take with and title announcement of the acquisition today. It's clearly centered on the digital services space. One of the components of that is the experience area which is where this acquisition squarely fits in.", "Our view started to look at what the landscape is for acquisitions in services across the varied digital components whether it is data, analytics, IoT and cloud. Those are the areas which have detailed components of a digital service architecture. We really examine acquisition opportunities and moving the services claim as we will start to look after.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Salil, I'll come back for follow-up, if you have time and all the best for the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Parag Gupta from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Parag Gupta", "Hi. Good evening everyone. So just two questions out here. Firstly, if you look at the deal trajectories that you announced today they seem to be pretty strong. Now you're looking at the numbers itself, we still probably haven't seen any significant pickup in growth rates across U.S. or BS V or retail for that matter. So just want to get a sense that, is the deal trajectory signaling an improvement in the demand environment going forward. Is it more forward-looking rather than the numbers which are possibly backward looking, or do you think there are some parts of the business that are actually dragging down overall growth. So that's my first question.", "And just the second question on the margins. But again, what I'm just trying to understand is you made one point that there is going to be a lot more investments in digital especially in areas that have seen under investments in the past. What I'm just trying to understand here is that it's being driven by what you're seeing in the market and what clients are demanding for or some of these investments, something that you're making in advance given the way the market is beginning to shape up. So, just trying to get some clarity on that. Thank you.", "Pravin Rao", "Hello. This is Pravin here. I will respond to the first part of the question. From this year we have seen tremendous growth in insurance services. We're seeing tremendous growth in energy and utilities and in the telecom space. We are also seeing good growth in the life services and healthcare space.", "On the -- whereas growth on the manufacturing side and on the DFS -- side of the DFS as well as on the retail side growth has been moderate. In the coming year we expect to see continued growth in energy, utilities, we expect to see the momentum continue in telecom as well. Any comments they run through expect to perform better in DFS than what we did this year.", "This year, if you ignore the impact of -- one of the large product cancellations last year at DFS, if you're normalizing the growth of DFS would have been on similar lines to company growth rate. And in DFS, our -- we have a much diversified portfolio, we have our strong presence in Europe, we have a strong presence in Indian banks as well.", "So, while we have seen some softness in large banks in North America, not in terms of spending up more in terms of diverting more spend to internally rather than through outsourcing. Other than that I think there is definitely continued spending in this bucket. So we remain optimistic about this, but it remains to be seen particularly in the North America where we have seen good growth in both Europe as well as rest of the world.", "I mean not been perfect as I said earlier, we had one [indiscernible] $905 million in revenue. Four of these states where in financial services and three in Seattle space. And this $905 million is the highest TCV in this quarter from this particular year. And total TCV was about $3 billion from that deal.", "The pipeline continues to be healthy and it's across different sectors as well as service lines. So net-net, like you see, they have seen good growth in few verticals. We have seen good growth in among geographies like Europe. We have seen some softness in North America but that's not related to any macro environment issues. So we are hopeful that spend will start coming back to North America this year.", "Now, coming back to where we are seeing some drags, from the sector perspective, we expect continued dullness in the retail space from our perspective. Apart from that some of our businesses like consulting, in the last year or two, we have had some challenges in consulting. We are still working on stabilizing then growth back in this area. It remains center to our strategy we have seen -- I have seen that still work on the progress and we expect few more quarters of challenges before its stabilizing.", "I will pass on to Salil to respond to the other question.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. In terms of where we are investing in digital, I mean, in fact that was outlined before. Within the space of digital, we have internally detail digital service architecture that we have built which comprises of five elements. And from that we're investing in some cases for example investing in the area of cloud, investing in the area of modernization of application landscapes, investing in the area of IoT, investing in the area of experience. So we've pick a few select areas within the digital landscape where we look to invest and clean up our capability to start to service the need that we see with our clients going forward.", "Parag Gupta", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Hi. Good evening. I have a question around some of the accounting with the acquisitions for Panaya and Skava going to be treated as discontinued operations and therefore taken out of the historical numbers or have they been taken out?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga here. As far as the IFRS standards, once identifying assets held for sale, which is driven by the management's intentions to sell. To reclassify all the assets and liabilities the assets held-for-sale and liabilities associated with that. After that we have to do a fair value assessment and we undertook fair value assessment from an independent valuer and $18 million of impairment loss has been recognized in the consolidated financial statement.", "And to answer your question, these are not discontinued operations. I mean these assets will continue to be generating because they have revenues and they have no cash flow associated with these assets. But we are classifying them as per IFRS as assets held-for-sale.", "And so accordingly what has happened is in the consolidated balance sheet we have called it out both the assets and liabilities and we have taken the impairment loss.", "Edward Caso", "So, the next related question is, how important were Panaya and Skava to someone of your existing revenue such that now you've indicated that it's for sale. Could it impact some of your existing revenue run rate?", "Pravin Rao", "Ed, this is Pravin here. We will continue to partner with them based on the irrespective of whatever outcome or shape it takes. We will continue to support to our existing clients and in future happen for new prospect out of plan if there is a need applicability of Skava and Panaya, we will continue to perform that.", "Edward Caso", "And my last question related again as the, the WongDoody, if I said that correct acquisition. If you got about one -- if you paid about one times revenue call it 75 million. That's about 2.5% growth within the 6% to 8% in guidance. Are you assuming 2% to 3% from this acquisition?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "We are talking about the recent acquisition. Now, this is -- what they have given, 6% to 8% is organic growth.", "Edward Caso", "Is organic growth.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "That's right.", "Edward Caso", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Chopra from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.", "Ashish Chopra", "Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Just one clarification on the previous question as well, Ranga. So while 6% to 8% is the organic growth, does it also bake in the course of revenue from Panaya and Skava as when and they get sold or currently that is not embedded in the guidance.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Well, I think they have taken into account that possibility. Clearly, this is the organic growth.", "Ashish Chopra", "Okay. And the second question was to Pravin, so Pravin you mentioned that overall spending in BFS remains healthy, but there is this trend on in certain primes in North America where they are taking the work back in-house. So if you could just elaborate on how secular or sporadic this is still whether it is really this fits to a very small set of clients. Do you see it happening across a wider set?", "Pravin Rao", "This is -- interesting is normally effective content that we have seen in the past -- if you look back over the last 10, 15 years has been -- we are seeing signs and we have seen acceleration of enforcing and over a period of time it has stabilized and we are seeing periods like [indiscernible] crore divested from those captives. But, today we are seeing is primarily in -- to some extent in -- give us space and also to some extent and probably the unseen state. It's something we have been seeing in the last couple of years, I would say.", "There are two primary reasons from our perspective, one obviously given on the technology disruptions and then sort of looking at building that capability and find these skills and capabilities of other level in India, they want to tap on to that instant capability.", "Second one is, as part of the usual confirmation, one part -- one element of transformation is modernizing their legacy and there is plan for embarking on that destiny there. And some of the plans have realized that they have outsourced that too aggressively. They don't have resident model in the legacy systems so we have seen clients increase and hoping for the purpose as well. It's a combination difficult to predict how long this trend will continue. But it's there.", "I mean we work, I mean for us it's in some sense it's interesting, in fact that grow to some extent. We also worked very closely with captives. We also help in many cases in terms of implementing that captives providing training assistance, recruit assistance and so on. And in many of the cases we have seen our book of business has also improved with duties and captives.", "Ashish Chopra", "Got it. And just lastly from my side, on one of the investment areas, you articulated for the margin guidance on revitalizing the sales. If you could just maybe throw some more light on that with respect to -- are we talking about having more feet on the ground or are we looking at changing the kind of mix with enough sales team or what exactly was entailed around that? Do we do we think we are probably sub-staff or is it a quality issue?", "Salil Parekh", "On the same, what would you like to do to expand what we have in terms of our sales capability. Our sales capability are very strong. However, there are areas and pockets we can go out to more subsectors -- in some areas -- in few European geographies. We could also plan to do something where we want to introduce more digital specialists into our sales mix and also to look at how we can work on account expansion programs. We really are expecting this.", "The primary focus is to expand the sales capacity into newer areas, some we just never climbed in and some intersecting geographic base.", "Ashish Chopra", "Got, of course. Thanks Salil. That's it from my side. Wish you all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois from a DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Hi, there. Hey. During Vishal time as CEO, he set a vision for emphasis that was more product focused and I guess my question at this stage is, is Infosys now planning to move back to more of a service orientation or will Infosys maintain the general vision that was set by Vishal on the product and software front?", "Salil Parekh", "Approach we laid out really talks to scale out digital services state today. We have a huge strengthen in services growth in agile, digital and of course services. That's the primary focus there -- they were driving the business. In addition to that we have what I call a scale platform like -- scale products and platforms. Like Finacle, like NIA which is a strong platform everyone will spend, like McCamish into the space like Edge those continue to be part of our future approach. We absolutely want to be driven to build out our digital services business, which is the primary focus for where our clients are going in the future.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Got it. And I hope to learn more about that. The follow up question is related to the margin guidance, your guidance implies some potential force some margin contraction based on the investment plans that you've outlined here. I guess I also wonder is the margin contraction outlook is partly accounting for risk that could stem from contract profitability issues given that your pricing has been somewhat more aggressive over the past couple years. I'm wondering if the guidance is accounting for potential contract profitability issues that could stem from that?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "This is Ranga here. No, that's not the reason. In fact if you look at two aspects, right, you look at the pricing this year in the constant currency basis, year-on-year price realization has improved by 0.2%. I mean it's broadly stable unlike the mid years. We're pleased to see pricing decline in constant currency between 1% and 1.5%. Second, this is not due to any contract contraction either in the sales or in the margin. This is not account of any of those. It's primarily our duty off investing in certain areas to drive the Silk Road and the sales revitalization and the U.S. timing model which is not to do with any specific contract contraction either in sales or margin.", "Rod Bourgeois", "So. This maybe the follow-up to that just real quick is, the price realization being up year-to-year. How much of that is due to mix and how much of that is due to the price improvement on apples-to-apples deal?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "I think it's very difficult to put number on both the buckets. Price realization is a combination of two factors. One is, of course, the rate cut in the T&M. T&M is straightforward, it is rate card. In case of a fixed price project is also a factor of the productivity that we achieve in a fixed price project after the commencement of the project which is either through onsite exchanges and the total headcount in a particular FTE, due to a better productivity management in a fixed price project. So as you know roughly 50% for revenues, little over 50% of revenues come from fixed price and they have the onsite part as well.", "The second reason for up tick in price or maybe not as much of a downward pressure that we saw in two years ago. Also we are seeing that is still, which is about 25.5% of revenues coming at better price points. So it's a combination of both.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Thank you. I'll yield the line and follow up on some other topics. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Rudra", "Hey thanks. Suddenly the high level Infosys has been espousing a strategy focusing on new services, artificial intelligence, automation and also reskilling employees. So from your strategic reappraisal, are you sort of endorsing that direction or are you making any kind of reprioritization areas. Any clarification there would be helpful?", "Salil Parekh", "Hi, Ankur. This is Salil. The approach we have laid really is focused on building our agile, digital services portfolio. That portfolio today which is approximately 2.8 billion in revenue and where we see quite a strong demand from our client and a large market opportunity. This then combined with revitalizing or energizing our core with automation and AI and reskilling.", "That focus and the localization in the U.S., our focus is really -- very centered on the services aspects plus key platforms and products like Finacle, McCamish, NIA and Edge. With the objective there is to be building relevance for our clients' digital journey is taking them and making sure that we are investing in and building up the capability sets and do with that, but again very much in the service group.", "Ankur Rudra", "Okay. And this is a follow-up on your guidance. I understand over the course of last year the commentary on banking perhaps changed a bit, we were all hoping for a bit of a recovery which was delayed several times. Are you seeing the new guidance you're still baking in a recovery in BFS spending or is that actually an upside to the guidance you stated?", "Pravin Rao", "Ankur, its Pravin here. We have factored on the estimates that are assumption clear are down each of the sector. And that's affecting quarter three, in the coming year, our expectation is yielding much better. It remains to be seen, how much it is based on whatever visibility we have that factored that into guidance.", "Ankur Rudra", "So, just to understand your commentary on banking, spending should improve in FY'19 is that the comment?", "Pravin Rao", "We do I mean -- today, when we look at banking there is some process in Americas, there is spending, but as I explained earlier some of the pending is being diverted to internally to captives. So that's from the Americas side. On the Europe side, we continue to be good traction.", "We are also seeing lot of spend in super regional and Indian banks in North America where we have good presence there. Hope it's a mixed bag. We believe that our portfolio mix -- our diverse portfolio mix will help us in capturing whatever spend that found there to one's hoping.", "So, from our perspective, while we are clear, I have explained, while we have a muted growth, but if you normalize for the impact of RBS, then our growth would be in line with the company growth.", "We do expect next year growth to be better and spend to come back to North America but it remains to be seen. But, based on our estimates what I have said is, our guidance factors into all this uncertainties and mix on estimates and that factored in the guidance", "Ankur Rudra", "And just for the margin guidance for next year, Ranga, if you could clarify, I know obviously you baked in a lot of things here, I think you are baking in stronger wage hike bonuses variable components as well. But how much of the -- lowering of the guidance is because of the step increase in local mix, new skills and investments versus the lack of operating leverage from existing levers that we had in prior years like utilization, onsite [indiscernible]?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga here. I think two aspects one of course is really the priority areas of investment that I talked about that is the primary one. And we do believe that the digital revenue which is 25.5% is that it's coming at higher price point and also had higher gross margin as well.", "We do believe that the rate of growth in digital should kind of minimize the impact of the core IT services pieces that you mentioned. Giving us an effect in the core IT services, the three things that we have been able to successfully do of course is utilization, which is we already said that at the current we are comfortable.", "Coming to onsite mix, which has come down below 29% this quarter and we do believe that we will continue to focus there. The third piece is really in the core IT services looking at the onsite part of the FTEs and we do believe that they have a play in terms of bringing more productivity and get some margin benefits there.", "So I think while we're focusing on the core aspects on the -- dimensions that I talked about, digital revenue growth, the higher gross margin is also important factor for us. And this time, we have also advanced all the salary hikes to April as you have seen and we've also kind of trying for higher variable pay in terms -- if you achieve the targets that we have set ourselves. So all these elements are part of our guidance.", "Ankur Rudra", "Okay. Thank you so much. And best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yogesh Agarwal from HSBC. Please go ahead.", "Yogesh Agarwal", "Yes. I just have one clarification, Ranga, in FY'17, Panaya and Skava were around $100 million, so as you mean they were down let's say 20% in FY'18. So, around $80 million, are you assuming any revenues in FY'19 in your 6% to 8% guidance or are you maybe for six months, are you not assuming any numbers?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Now. Let me clarify. I think both Panaya and Skava posted, their revenues are not material for us.", "Yogesh Agarwal", "Okay. Okay. So it doesn't matter that if you include\u2026.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Very, yes, not material for us. And that did not impact the guidance that we have given and in fact the fixed rate that they have given bakes into account the -- it's purely organic. Panaya and Skava revenue are not material for us.", "Yogesh Agarwal", "Got it. Thank you, Ranga. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Bergin", "Yes. Hi. My first question. Can you talk about your expectations for the slower revenue growth throughout the year as it relates to 6% to 8%? How do you expect that progress throughout the year?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. And if you look at the Q4 revenue growth just concluded quarter, the year-on-year has been 9.2%. And if you compare to -- and during the course of fiscal '18, we have seen improvement in the year-on-year growth quarter-on-quarter.", "So for example Q2 and Q3 was 8% and now we have Q4 is more than 9%. I think that is and also we have got a decent exit rate that we have seen unlike some of the previous years of Q4, we have had decent exit rate. And typically as you know we are looking at -- given the -- given our earlier profile, Q1 and Q2 typically our first half typically happens to be stronger than the second half that has been the pattern. But, without even -- I didn't want to give a sense that look that is going to continue. But having said that, the good exit rate that we have gives us confidence saying that look Q1 and Q2 are the first half, would be broadly in line with the pattern we have seen in the earlier years.", "So, to answer your question, it is not back ended, the question is which is primarily Q3 and Q4 growth is where it is that's not how we have planned for the street.", "Bryan Bergin", "And my next question, discuss your plans as it relates to augmenting the strategic consolidated capabilities?", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. In terms of consulting with the approach we want to progress is, we expect the significant amount of growth coming from consulting given that's the area that worked closer with the business user. We are working on our consulting business that Pravin shared with you had calculated in fiscal '17, which was typical of the instrument. We have now put in place a turnaround plan to get that consulting, really focused on where is growing in terms of some of three elements and quite a lot of the business linkages that we need to scale up with the normalcy have your buyer on the business side. That is the level of consulting activity that we have which is what we need to enhance in fiscal '19 and we hope to do that over the next 12 to 18 months.", "Bryan Bergin", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.", "Girish Pai", "Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. A couple of questions, one was regarding a capital return, is there any regulatory issue that could prevent you from making a buyback of this 1.6 billion in FY'19?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "If you look at the April 2017 policy based on that we did the buyback right. We did the buyback of up to $2 billion, we just concluded. There are no restrictions, of course, that could go by the guidelines in India, it's a big guidelines with very specific on [indiscernible] et cetera. But, there is no restriction. What the board has stated which has identified $1.6 billion and the mode of disbursement, you can decide later. So that's the thing it's not about any restriction.", "Girish Pai", "[indiscernible] part, would that prevent you from making a buy like in FY'18 or would be a 4Q FY'19 event?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "In India of course there is a time gap which is there between two successive buybacks as per the setting guideline. Typically runs about 12 months that has been the broad timeline. So, that's one aspect. But, beyond that there are no restriction but as the Board as clearly said in our capital allocation policy we have earmarked and the mode of disbursement, we have kept it as flexible and that will be decided by the Board in sometime.", "Girish Pai", "Okay. My second question is regard to the mix between you and [indiscernible] $3 billion last deal DCV number. If you can like, you mentioned, Pravin you mentioned a certain number for 4Q, but can you tell for the full year how much the number is?", "Pravin Rao", "This year the number is what $3 million, so for Rs. 3 crore it was $905 million. So on an average it has been about $872 million to $800 million in the other three quarter.", "Girish Pai", "No, no. The mix between you and net new?", "Pravin Rao", "Q3, yeah. It increased about 32% net new out of the $905 million, for the year, it's about 30%.", "Girish Pai", "Okay. Thank you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from JM Financial. Please go ahead.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Yes. Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. So, on the digital it seems that there is some kind of a realignment in your priorities and the portfolio which you are not going to target. That appears to be more closer towards UPS have been focusing on for some time. So, my question is that, do you think that you could be at a disadvantage here as others have already moved much ahead of this?", "Salil Parekh", "First, what was interesting to see is, the existence of our digital capabilities today. Today we already have 2.8 billion of digital work in the deep line digital services architecture that we've developed. And it's now growing as I said earlier quarter-on-quarter at quite a rapid space in fiscal '18 and we see that's continued ahead.", "That's very much focused on the future is this becomes the growth engine for us given our client's future relevance to this sort of work. We want to make sure that the invests build this out when we have all the full lifecycle of digital capability is available where our clients go.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Okay. And Pravin in the $3 billion of this year, were there any digital deal was so part of that?", "Pravin Rao", "Sorry.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Of the $3 billion dealings that you announced --", "Pravin Rao", "For the year.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Yes.", "Pravin Rao", "See, which of this large deals happen, element of digital, we have millions of deals that were elements of cloud migration and legacy transformation and so on. We have not segregated or computed how much of percentage our digital is, whatever the extent of digital, that is counted towards the 25.5% of only $2.8 billion that Salil talked about. We have not tracked that deal level to say what percentage of this $3 billion is digital.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Sure. Understand. And lastly just, Ranga clarification, the investment in digital and reskilling that you are talking about for the margins outlook, is it building in any impact of any acquisitions also in those areas as part of this?", "Pravin Rao", "No. We are not looking at the acquisitions impact on this. This is primarily on the investment that we need to make either by day of servicing and either through the employee base investments or some of the IP based investments. It doesn't take into account any acquisition cost attributable to this areas.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Sure. Got it. Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Nomura. Please go head.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Yes. Hi. I had one question, you seem to be indicating higher wage hike this year. Do you think this could be an industry phenomena or this is more Infosys specific?", "Salil Parekh", "No, no. The real hike is in same range what we did last year. So I don't see any difference. So, like last year, we will continue to differentiate and majority will be [indiscernible] when we see wage increase particularly in India between mid single-digit to high single-digit understanding with what we are seeing in the last year and it's line with what we are seeing in the market.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. And the second question, though the subcontractor expense has -- they depressed your margin by almost 50 basis in FY'18, do you think this will go up further given the inflation based restrictions that are coming up on the leaders?", "Salil Parekh", "See. One of the things, as you know, the need for subcontractors comes essentially when -- it's primarily of course, it's more than 95% onsite. And it comes primarily when we do not have the required skill set manpower to start a particular project on time due to non-availability of visa or that is also not being available or searching some other products and so on.", "I think awarded course of year, we have taken actions in terms of making sure that subcontractor seeing this, something is a last option after exhausting all the option. And at the same time there are several projects, where lack of availability of couple of resources especially in digital kind of project will decrease the ability of the company to go after those projects. And what we are also do, we have done during the course of the year is also that the price point at which these subcontractor deployed in our projects are higher to make sure that there is a fair amount of diligence and discipline on the margin for the subcontractors.", "So this is something that we're addressing at one front. In the second front, the U.S. talent model is really the core vehicle that we are looking at to make sure that the supply chain aspects that I talked about, ability to staff engagements on time. It's all clearly getting impacted by the visa issues in the second lever.", "I think both are important for us, but in the short-term I think, we're comfortable with the current level. And as we move much more towards the established.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. Just one small one, in terms of digital you talked about what's your q-o-q growth, can you share what the y-o-y growth in digital was this quarter?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "At this point in time, we are able to share q-o-q and from Q1 will be providing more color on the digital revenues. So that is a trajectory that you could depict for all the investors and having let you track", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. Thanks a lot and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from CIMB. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Shah", "Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Salil just want to understand what all three, four parameters you will look for to measure the achievement of the strategy which you are putting forward starting from FY'19?", "Salil Parekh", "It is for us to believe the measure that we will start to, very focused on and this $2.8 billion revenue that I have referred in fiscal 2018 and how that trajectory expands strategically in fiscal 2019 and the years to go at.", "Internally, we still start to look at, how, yes, I call it that, this digital index works across all sectors, across our accounts, when the percentage of rescaling is between [indiscernible]. Are we looking at our account expansion parameters internally and what percentage of what is focused in financial digital. What is good margin and pricing that we see in a digital business. So, in total we design 6 or so parameters that surely we want to drive this business.", "Actually we are now focused on the growth of this absolute revenue on the $2.8 billion.", "Sandeep Shah", "Okay. And second, on the large deal [indiscernible] traditional IT, you guys are achieving this mark of close to $1 billion is achievable or it could be still a work in process?", "Pravin Rao", "Our ambition is to reach that -- we are almost there on an average we have been doing about 750 to 800 [indiscernible]. But sometimes the challenge is, from the cycle times are longer than we anticipate, some of the deals we have pushed to the subsequent quarter. But looking at the pipeline, it's achievable and that's where we are focusing on.", "Sandeep Shah", "Just last question on the margin guidance of 20% to 24% based on you replied to the earlier question, it does not relate to a contractual profitability. So it looks like, it's an investment to write the growth. So, is it fair to say that because your growth as to be up 6% to 8% is not materially different than the 5.8% in FY'2018, so that shows the margin compromise as not lead into kind of a growth in FY'2019.", "But, is it fair to say that once this investment is their forum, next two to three years, the growth comes back to high single digit to a low double digit and your margin can be leveraged because of the growth?", "Pravin Rao", "I think as clearly said earlier this is non-account of any particular contractual contraction either on volume or on slides or anything of that sort. It's not due to any of those factors. It is purely based on our intention to invest in digital areas to accelerate growth in those areas and revitalize our sales to make sure that we are better placed to capture the growth in the coming years. So I think that's the whole intention.", "At this point in time we have guided for 6% to 8% in FY'19. At this point in time, we do not want to comment beyond FY'19. But, our endeavor would be that these investments are for growth and they are not one-off chunky investments or simply cost to address any particular contractual contraction.", "Sandeep Shah", "And just one clarification, this guidance is on a constant currency or will the rupee depreciate [indiscernible] that the pressure in terms of this guidance would be slightly lower?", "Pravin Rao", "Well, I think the 6% to 8% is certainly constant currency, if you are referring to the margin, when we give margin guidance, we always assume certain currency momentum vis-\u00e0-vis rupee that has been baked into the mark.", "Sandeep Shah", "Okay. Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for their closing comments. Over to you sir.", "Salil Parekh", "Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining in for this call.", "In terms of our closing, I'm really delighted we have had a strong Q4, the strong closing of the year. Q4 starting to see growth at 9.2% and its strong operating margin performance.", "In terms of looking ahead, we're pretty focused on our four pillars of our strategy. First, scale out agile digital business, which is 2.8% today, which grew Q4 on Q3 by 3.6%. Second, energize our core apply automation and artificial intelligence and really drive productivity improvement into that and on the business. Third, reskill our employees and fourth, localize and our marketing starting especially in the U.S. with the talent and capability.", "We believe this is a strategic direction that is going to give us more and more relevance to [indiscernible] future and we are looking forward to execute that with the investments that have been outlined for those growth areas.", "With that, our guidance for fiscal '19 reconfirms what we have discussed today, 6% to 8% in constant currency terms revenue growth 22% to 24% operating margin.", "Thank you, everyone again and looking forward to catching up on our Analyst Day Investor Day and the future calls.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of Infosys that's concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us. And now you can now disconnect your lines."]}

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo. Thank you and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Hello everyone. I\u2019m Sandeep from the Investor Relations Team, Bangalore. Welcome to Infosys\u2019 Q1 \u201815 earnings call. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, and other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the Company for the recently concluded quarter, before opening up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Good morning, everyone. Let me give you some highlights of our performance in Q1 FY15 and what we see ahead for the rest of the year. Our revenue growth for the quarter was 2% on reported basis and 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Volume grew by 2.9% with on-site volumes growing by 2.2% and offshore volume by 3.2%. Realization for the quarter was down by 0.2% on a reported basis and 0.8% on a constant currency basis.", "Pricing remains favorable carriers more periods except for commoditized services and large deals, which are price sensitive segments. On-site deferred mix for the quarter was 29.2%, fairly similar to 29.4% last quarter. Our initiatives over the last few quarters to optimize our operations resulted in our utilization excluding trainees moving up to 80.1% this quarter, in line with our targeted range of 80% to 82%. Utilization, including trainees, also increased to 74.7%. Client addition was strong in Q1. We added 61 new clients in Q1. We added 11,500 employees gross, with a net addition of 879 employees in Q1.", "Our attrition continued to be a matter of concern. We have taken a number of steps to reduce attrition. We have improved our predictability for employees by giving timely compensation increases this year. We have introduced a quarterly promotion cycle to promote eligible employees quickly. We have increased the variable payout over the last few quarters. We have introduced a fast track career path for high performers. We hope to see a reduction in attrition as a result of these initiatives.", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 25.1% as compared to 25.5% last quarter. EPS for the quarter was $0.84, lower than Q4 last year, due to the impact of compensation increases, rupee appreciation and investment in new Visa. We also paid out $8 million to Infosys Foundation as part of our CSR commitment. As mentioned in the last call, we have given compensation increase of 6% to 7% for our offshore employees and 1% to 2% for our on-site employees effective April 1st.", "During Q1, we signed five large deals with TCV of $700 million. Three deals were in Americas, one each in Europe and rest of the world. Two deals were in manufacturing while one each was in financial services, retail and life sciences. A majority of our large deal pipeline continues to be more around restructuring of existing IT spend of our clients.", "We saw another quarter of traction in cloud, Big Data and infrastructure services with a win of 20 new engagements. Our IMS business had a very strong double digit growth this quarter as the deals won in earlier quarters ramped up. We set up Edge Verve Systems Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Infosys. Edge Verve will have clients serve the needs of their digital consumers and leverage the power of business ecosystems. Edge Verve develops and operates cloud hosting business platforms and products for our global clients across geos and verticals offering these on a pay-as-you-use service.", "Overall demand environment remains largely stable. Based on what we have delivered in Q1 and our expectation for the rest of the year, we have retained the revenue guidance at 7% to 9% for FY15. As you know, this will be the last time I will be speaking on this platform. I took over in August 2011 amongst a very challenging environment. ", "Infosys was faced with several external and internal challenges during that period. Externally we were just coming out of an economic crisis and micro-economic conditions were uncertain and volatile. Our clients were tentative and the decision cycles were longer. Internally we were faced with a number of Infosys specific challenges. On the legal and regulatory front, we were dealing with employee retaliation cases, investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and U.S. Department of Homeland Security relating Visa matters.", "We were pleased with trailing business momentum at the same time. We had not applied for adequate research in FY12, which resulted in shortage of talent, on-site talent in FY13. This led us to hiring large number of people on-site, as well as increasing our subcontractors cost and resulting in a reduction in our margins. We needed to relook and revamp our compliance procedures as a part of the investigation from the government.", "We were also in the midst of the 3.0 transformation, which required us to put new structures and new organizational structures in place. Today these challenges are behind us. In FY14 we completed a civil settlement that concluded investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. A U.S. Court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the employee. All other lawsuits are dismissed or settled. We have aggressively moved ahead in our strategic directions.", "Our Infosys 3.0 transformation is complete and well understood. We renewed our focus on strategic sourcing deals to regain lost ground in the bid space. We made a strategic acquisition of Lodestone to increase our presence in consulting in Europe. We doubled our revenue growth rate in FY14 compared to FY13. We grew by 5.8% in FY13 and 11.5% in FY14. We reduced the GAAP between our growth rate and the industry growth rate considerably in FY14.", "I firmly believe that Infosys today is stronger than what it was few years back. We are investing in emerging areas like infrastructure services, emerging technologies and newer markets like Continental Europe. Through all this we have established a foundation which will take Infosys to greater heights. I wish Vishal and his team the very best in capitalizing on the opportunities that lie ahead.", "Before I sign off, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your continuous support, trust and affection that you have extended to us over the years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our clients, employees, vendors and other stakeholders. I have enjoyed my interactions with all of you over the years and learned immensely from them.", "Once again thank you for the same. With that now let me pass on to Pravin to give color on the business segments.", "Pravin Rao", "", "Thank you Shibu. Hello everyone. I will take you through the various business segments. In financial services, risk and complaints, infrastructure modernization, digital enterprise and vendor consolidation are the key spending drivers. In capital markets there is a huge focus to cut mid and back office costs. Banks are increasingly looking at innovative deals like converting CapEx to OpEx our deals with committed savings. Spending challenges remain for U.S. banks with many discretionary projects being placed on hold or cancelled altogether.", "As a result growth is expected to be muted in both consumer and commercial banking for large banks, although wealth and investment management are expected to grow. Client spending in Europe is however stable. Overall deal activity in this sector is slightly better than last quarter. Insurance sector spend is more in the areas of regulatory compliance and digital transformation. We are also witnessing increased spend in security in COTS and payment segment.", "Though the growth in quarter one was flat, we had a better pipeline exiting the quarter compared to the beginning of the quarter with new deals having come up for re-bids. Spending in the sector is mostly in the areas of annuity testing, maintenance and legacy migration. Spend in retail and CPG is a mixed bag. Retailers are spending on omni-channel, cloud, digital transformation and infrastructure optimization. CPG companies are investing in core modules of SAP and areas like paid promotion management. Budgets are under pressure and focus on increasing ROI is high. Leadership changes and few claims have slowed down decision making but also providing newer opportunities as client seek newer delivery models.", "Deal pipeline in the vertical has improved on the back of creating deals proactively and taking them to the client. Business momentum remains stable in manufacturing. We see demand in ERP led transformation, digital transformation, analytics, infrastructure management and so on. Spending in auto is healthy, under pressure in aerospace and flattish in both hi-tech and industrial manufacturing. Discretionary spending remains low in some of our large hi-tech clients. In Americas we have seen deals around both discretionary and non-discretionary spend while in Europe spend is more towards consolidation and renewal of old contracts. Deal pipeline is better in Europe especially in infrastructure deals while division cycles remains similar to last quarter.", "In telecom, clients continue to grapple with top line challenges which are causing significant budget cuts in some of our large clients. Consolidation within the industry is also likely to create growth challenges especially in the second half of the year. There are opportunities in improving customer experience, churn reduction and operational efficiency for clients.", "In Energy, growth opportunities exist in Oilfield Service segment and helping our clients become more efficient. In Utilities, there is high focus on regulation and compliance. Clients are also looking to simply their operations to remain competitive. In Life Sciences, clients are going through challenges due to reduced product differentiation and pricing pressures in the payer segment. Clients are focused on cost takeouts, compliance and digital transformation. There is significant reduction in overall discretionary spend. We expect our investments in domain solutions around clinical trial management systems, regulatory submissions and digital marketing to generate opportunities for us. Our SAP led transformation offerings, strengthened by Lodestone acquisition are providing us good traction in the market.", "In the growth market unit there are client initiatives to lower infrastructure cost to cloud adoption. We also see opportunities around consolidation of global operations. Coming to BPO, clients are focused on transformation of their business processes. We are seeing a reduction in large multi-tower BPO deals. Deal pipeline has improved year-on-year though division cycles are long. Trends are mixed and vary by industry within BPO with banking seeing some improvement while manufacturing and telecom seeing a dip. Finacle\u2019s exposure to discretionary budgets in the banking industry has led to another tough quarter with the discretionary spending impacted by pressure on bank margins and reduced budgets. We see steady investments being made in channel modernization, compliance, payments and mobility. Client demand is focused on step change rather than large scale transformations.", "I will now handover to Rajiv to talk about the financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "", "Thank you, Pravin. Good morning everyone. I will take you through the financial highlights. Our first quarter revenues were at $2.133 billion as against $2.092 billion last quarter which is sequential growth of 2%. Important to note here is that IT services revenue grew by 2.5%. We had certain decline in revenues in our product business which is why the reported growth is about 2%. In constant currency, the growth was at 1.5%. We have seen our volumes increase sequentially by 2.9% which is significantly higher as compared to the last two quarters and gives us the confidence for the subsequent quarters. On-site volumes increased by 2.2% and offshore volumes increased by 3.2%. Again, important to note that on-site volumes have gone up after a couple of quarters, which is a good sign, which means that a lot of projects are starting on-site and typically the ramp up happens offshore in the subsequent quarters.", "Our on-site mix declined by 0.2% during the quarter. Our gross margins for the quarter were flat at 37%. As you may be aware, under the new Companies Act, the Company is required to provide justification if the useful life of its fixed assets is different from what is described in the Companies Act. Historically, we had different useful life for our assets compared to what is described in the act. During the quarter, in compliance with the Act, we carried out external assessment of the useful life of our assets. I have mentioned this in our recent AGM speech where we mentioned that we are revaluating the useful life of assets. The external assessment covered buildings, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures, since these assets accounted for 83% of our asset base as at March 31, 2014.", "The external valuer determined the useful life of furniture and fixture at five years, the useful life of computer equipment at three to five years and useful life of buildings at 22 to 25 years. Had the Company continued with the previously assessed useful life, the charge for depreciation would have been higher by $22 million for the assets held at April 1, 2014 and hence the change in useful life had a positive impact of 110 basis points on our operating margins.", "You may recall that at the beginning of the quarter, we had stated that our operating margin for the quarter would drop by 220 to 250 basis points due to impact of salary increase, visa and rupee appreciation. During the quarter, the impact of salary increase and visa and rupee appreciation was offset by 3.4% improvement in utilization and the change in estimated useful life of the assets, limiting the operating margin decline to 40 basis points.", "The average dollar-rupee rate -- the rupee appreciated by 2.9% during the quarter. However some of the impact was offset across currency movements which are in our favor. We have also contributed to $8 million during the quarter to Infosys Foundation towards corporate social responsibility as mandated by the Companies Act. Other income for the quarter was at $139 million, which included a ForEx gain of $22 million. Yield on other income was at 9.42% during the quarter. We have outstanding hedges of $1.034 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our effective tax rate for the quarter is at 28.6%. The net margins for the quarter were at 22.6% as compared to 23.2% in the previous quarter. EPS for the quarter is at $0.84 as compared to $0.85 last quarter.", "Our cash and cash equivalent, including available for sale assets and certificates of deposits were at $4.943 billion and as of June 30. This is after payment of an annual dividend including dividend tax of $479 million during the quarter. The DSOs margin increased to 66 days on a consolidated basis as compared to 62 days last quarter. We have retained our guidance at 79% in dollar terms for FY15. This is based on what we have achieved in Q1 and what we expect for the next three quarters.", "With this, I\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Participants we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). We have the first question from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen", "Gentlemen, you mentioned that pricing was impacted by pricing pressure in the commoditized areas and large deals. Can you quantify how did it impact overall blended pricing levels for the quarter? And then in your guidance. You reiterated the top-line growth numbers. But can you make any comments on margins for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the pricing my commentary was that the pricing is stable. We have some part of our business and IT operations service which is under pricing pressure, but we have to look at the pricing as a portfolio. We have three different distinct service lines. We have number of clients and number of geographies and industry verticals. So when we look at it as a portfolio, my remark was that pricing is stable at this point.", "Now this is irrespective of what we have seen this quarter. We have seen a marginal decline of revenue realization per employee, 0.4%, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a secular trend. So at this point our commentary is that the pricing is stable. Even when we are seeing some pricing pressure in certain service lines, our overall portfolio allows us to keep it stable. On the margin front, let me request Rajiv to give the answer.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Hi, Moshe. No, see our pricing is stable. If you look at the last couple of quarters, we have seen pricing moving up and down by less than 1%, which is a good sign. Having said that, the large outsourcing deals are definitely more price-sensitive and they view it, see pricing challenges on them.", "Over the last four quarters there has been lot of initial effort gone into correcting our cost structures and today we feel quite comfortable with the cost structure though there is still some work to be done. But our cost structure is definitely much better than what it was couple of quarters back. This gives us the confidence to invest in the business. The first priority would be to accelerate the growth, because once the Company starts growing at industry averages or industry leading growth, then I think it will be easy to sustain the operating margins. The cost optimization measures can only help the margins up to the point and beyond that the growth would have to kick in.", "So I think the important part would be to invest for the future, invest for the growth, don\u2019t leave any business on table and plan ahead of time. So that's the reason I think I would be more comfortable in spite of having them better than what was expected in Q1. I would still believe that our annual margins would be what we were seeing in April, probably around the same number as last year or probably because depreciation impact 100 basis points higher. But I would not expect the margins to go up beyond that depending on the needs for investment.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen", "Okay, just a follow-up. Europe was sequentially, slightly down sequentially. Can you breakdown the growth by the UK and then Continental Europe and then explain why their region didn\u2019t grow?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I wouldn\u2019t consider that as a secular trend, it\u2019s a quarter-to-quarter aberration. We don\u2019t see any reason at this point to think that trend will continue. So I will not consider that as a secular trend.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "On the pricing front, are you seeing those issues on new deals and renewals and how much of it is linked to demand versus general maturity?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Hold on one second. Can you please repeat that question, it was not very clear?", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Yes. So on the pricing front, I wanted to know whether it was on new business or renewals or both and how much of that pricing is linked to demand versus just general maturity of the business?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I don\u2019t believe that is the right way to categorize it. What we are seeing is some parts of BITS business; business and IT operations business is price-sensitive. So for example application maintenance is price-sensitive. Some part of infrastructure management is price sensitive, things like that. It is not new and old business issue, it is more about which service lines are price sensitive. So in a very broad sense, some parts of BITS, business and IT operations which for us include application development, application maintenance, business process management, infrastructure management, and independent validation. These are the areas which come under business and IT operations. Out of that application maintenance and actually there is some part of infrastructure maintenance would definitely be price sensitive.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Okay. On the demand front, are there pockets of weakness as you discussed or is demand a bit weaker than what you thought it was going to be going into this year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually if I look at the pipeline, the pipeline has marginally improved from the beginning of the quarter until now. Remember now the guidance is a statement of fact, as we see it for us. In many ways it reflects Infosys and its clients. So from the beginning of the year to now, I didn\u2019t believe that the pipeline has improved marginally. There are certain areas where we see weakness. So for example our growth rate in Life Sciences or in Services business is slightly behind our average. There are certain pockets. I\u2019m going to ask Pravin to give you some color on the industry vertical wise demand.", "Pravin Rao", "Overall, across industries two trends are common. There is tremendous focus on taking cost out of the system and that in some sense is translating into opportunities around large application, outsourcing deal, infrastructure consolidation deals and so on. And on the discretionary side, there is again all the savings from cost takeout has been pumped into discretionary side and most of the investment is around customer facing activities. So we see lot of opportunities around retail transformation, around analytics, around business intelligence and cloud and so on.", "From a vertical perspective, we are seeing good pipeline in financial services, in manufacturing, in Retail and CPG. Life Sciences and Telecom to some extent is silent. And geography wise also the demand, we see good pipeline across even through in Europe we had -- our growth was limited this quarter, but it\u2019s not a secular trend. The pipeline is healthy. So by enlarge in most segments; we see descent traction, good traction. And from a services perspective we are a lot of traction in infrastructure management on digital transformation, cloud adoption and so on.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Last question for me, just around discretionary spending. I know you mentioned it. What are your expectations for discretionary spending through the back half of the year? Has it been steady? Do you expect uptick or downtick? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for what\u2019s built into guidance for discretionary spending?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think the discretionary spending is steady, but the nature of spending is different. We\u2019re not seeing large mega-transformation programs. We are seeing small lucrative kind of programs and in many times - in many cases clients actually look at some of it on the quarterly basis, based on their own individual performance. So to that extent, the spending is back, but clients continue to be cautious and the nature of spending is also varied.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Ed Caso - Wells Fargo", "On the earlier call you\u2019ve talked about going to the schools to recruit about 300 sales people, if I heard correctly. Are you also seeking people from the market? And how long -- of these graduates that you\u2019re targeting, how long do you think it would take them to sort of ramp up and begin to be productive on the sales front? Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, on the sales side, I think we have 172 people who have joined us. They are undergoing training at this point and will get deployed pretty soon into the market. The remaining people will join as the year goes by. We are also having open intent for about 144 people to be recruited aboard for our delivery site. So I believe that the 172 who have joined us already will be in the market in the next four - five weeks. And the remaining will come in during the year.", "Ed Caso - Wells Fargo", "And your guidance, are they expected to contribute this year?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, this is Pravin here. We are conducting an induction program for them, eight-week induction program and post that, we expect them to be productive. So they\u2019ll be definitely contributing the second half of the year. And in addition to hiring from business schools, we have also recently deployed about 150 account managers. These are people with delivery background, strong technical background and good understanding of the client and business also in the sales role, with a view to help in mining the accounts better. So that\u2019s the additional bandwidth we have added this quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "I have two questions if I could. The first is on growth. I was hoping you could talk top line growth. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cost structure takeout activities that you are engaged with. Are those finished and what are those? Because I\u2019m trying to relate it to the quarterly growth at about 1.5% constant currency. My perspective is it\u2019s probably still going to be below what some of your leading competitors are. So I\u2019m just trying to understand are the cost structure activities --since most of your costs are in fact in the people\u2019s side, are they limiting your growth and what might be the activities there that enable you to emulate some of your largest peers\u2019 growth rates? How long will that take or what needs to happen in order to get there? Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the growth side, we are very much focused on growth. As I said, we have gotten out of many of the challenges which we had, which were Infosys specific internal challenges. Those are behind us and today we are very much focused on growth. And our growth is dependent on the deals which we closed and as you can see this quarter, we have closed approximately $700 million TCV in large deals alone. And the pipeline, as I said, is stronger than what -- marginally stronger than what we entered the quarter with.", "At the same time, if you look at the revenue growth required, we need 2.2% sequential for the next three quarters to reach the lower end and 3.5% sequential for the remaining three quarters to reach the upper end. And given all those factors, we have kept the guidance at 7% to 9%. But our aspiration is definitely to get to the industry average. It takes time because we have a lag effect, because the wins of today is not -- will not yield the sales immediately. It will take time to build the stock of wins and eventually that will yield results. As far as the cost takeout is concerned, it was predominantly focused on things like onset offshore ratios, things like avenues to performance management and et cetera, et cetera. They have not impacted our ability to grow in my mind.", "Rajiv Bansal", "The whole idea of cost optimization was primarily to become more competitive in our marketplace, and one of the reasons was to fix our cost structures. It is not about cutting cost where it was needed for growth. A lot of the cost optimization benefits have been flowed back into the business. So you have seen uptick in margins primarily because of utilization and other operational parameters being better, but a lot of benefits which have come from cost optimization are being flowed back to the business -- is giving us the confidence to invest back in the business, hire more people, train them better, invest in the market, hire more sales guys, invest in technology. So I think these both have to run parallel. We have to keep again our costs carefully. We have to optimize our costs. We have to get our cost structures right. At the same time flow the savings back on the business to extend our growth.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "My next question is more tactical and scopist. I\u2019m just trying to understand how you are looking at the potential -- sequential growth rate over the next three quarters to reach that 7% to 9% range? And more specifically is the way the year unfolded last year in the September, December and March quarters, is that the way we should be potentially think about it? In other words might September be a bigger impact than the next two quarters? Will December look more like September? Any kind of color you can give us based on the pipeline that you have in front of us on how you see the sequential growth unfolding for the next three quarters?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Definitely the pipeline is much better and the pipeline is healthy, but we have stopped giving our quarterly guidance. So I would not be able to break up the numbers for you as to what we expect in the second quarter and the third and fourth quarter. But as what Shibu said, for meeting our guidance at the lower end, we need 2.2% sequentially for the next three quarters and for our upper end we need 3.5% sequentially over the next few quarters to meet 9%. ", "Having said that, the second quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter. So we would expect to do -- we hope to do better than that. But yes, a lot would depend into closing the deals pipelined and getting the pipeline larger with every single passing day, winning more, investing more into technology and people.", "So I think at this point of time, we have evaluated our pipeline, we\u2019ve looked at the business in the pipeline and that there are opportunities that we have in the marketplace and we feel that we would be in between that range that we have given of 7% to 9%. But I would not be able to breakup further for you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anantha Narayan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse", "My first question was basically addressed to Rajiv on the margin front. So your utilization is at about 80% right now. Do you have a medium term target that you would be comfortable with?", "Rajiv Bansal", "As I\u2019ve been saying in our all our conversations, I would expect the utilizations to be 81% - 82%. So 80.1% is definitely a good sign. If you look at our utilization over the last four quarters. It has gone up almost every quarter and this has actually given us a lot of confidence with respect to where we stand today with our cost structures. Our volumes have increased this quarter. As I said it\u2019s 2.9% volume increase which is very, very good. A lot would depend on what - the kind of quarterly growth rates you are seeing for the next three, four quarters and investing in people ahead of time. So you would see the utilization moving in a narrow band from here on quarter on quarter, but in the medium to long term, we would plan for 80% - 81% utilization. ", "", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And my final question was on the attrition numbers. Do you have a MIS that sort of captures attrition on a monthly basis and if so, can you just talk us through the trends in the last three or four months?", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, we do not disclose those numbers, our LTM attrition is what we usually disclose. Our attrition as I said is above our comfort level and we are doing multiple interventions to bring it down. Many of them have been done and many more will be done. With that, we are hoping that the attrition will come down.", "", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse", "My question is should we expect sort of -- should we expect to see an improvement in the near future this is more -- this could take a bit of time.", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "Tan is CA, let me request Tan.", "", "Tan Moorthy", "Good evening. This is Tan. While interventions have started, we expect that it will take some time for those to yield results. For example people who will leave us this quarter are people who would have made that decision sometime ago. So we expect that some of these results will begin to kick in over the next two or three quarters and not immediately.", "", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question is from the line of Sharan Gupta from Aquarius Securities, please go ahead.", "", "Sharan Gupta - Aquarius Securities", "My question is related to the growth. So if I can read this correctly, generally the large deals that you unveil, only 15%-20% of their TCV value in the first year of operation and they ramp up later part of the year. So first is this understanding correct of the large deals that we have announced of $700 million and if that\u2019s so, then in order to meet our FY15 guidance, do we -- is it contingent on the fact that we need to win more than our $700 million number, each of the next three quarters.", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "So it is true. When we win large deals, in fact we don\u2019t realize 15%, we usually realize about 10% in the first year of the total wins. And we realize about 15% - 20% over the next four to five years. That is the right way to look at it. Now to reach our guidance 6% - 9%, as I said under [ph] the guidance with liquidity and high percent [ph] growth, quarter on quarter for the remaining three quarters and lower end will require 2.2% of the growth for the remaining three quarters. See when we enter a year, usually we have visibility for 65% of our business. That is what we\u2019ve seen historically and that is one of the criteria we look at when we give our guidance. And when we enter a quarter we have visibility for 95% of our business. So during the quarter we have about 5% of the business which we need to catch up on. During the year we have approximately 35% of the business which we need to catch up on. Now one quarter is over. We are the in the first, second quarter. So we still have some business to catch up with.", "", "Now it is not imperative that all of it is going to come from very large opportunities, because we have -- part of our growth comes from CSI and consulting and system integration space, part of it comes from products and platform space. More importantly part of it comes from expansion in existing programs and existing clients, where these may not be large deals at all. So to complete our guidance, we will need to do all of the above.", "", "We need to win that deals, we need to expand in existing relationships, we need to ramp up the deals which we\u2019ve already won, we need to win more deals in consulting and system integration and products and platform. So it is true, we need to win more of them but it\u2019s also true that we need to do many more things other than that.", "", "Sharan Gupta - Aquarius Securities", "Thank you and just a follow up for Pravin here. Based on the answer that Shibu just gave, so what would be the areas which would be a low hanging fruit in catching up for the 35% of the business for the next three quarters in terms of verticals or deals which you think are, would be more likely to come through?", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "See, this is Shibu. I\u2019ll give it to Pravin. The 35% probably has now come down, because we are one quarter out into the year. See our revenue growth comes from new business as well as expanding our existing business as I said. The low hanging fruit is always to probably expand the existing business and to ramp up the deals which we have already won. That will be the low hanging fruit. And the higher hanging fruit would be the new deals to be closed. And so we have one of these deals, $700 million of TCV we have won. Out of that, part of it is rebate, but there is a big part of it which is not a rebate. If you look at this quarter, our infrastructure services grew by 13%. That happened not because we won the 13% this quarter. That happened because we ramped up the wins we had from the previous quarters. So the low hanging fruit is always existing clients close deals. Then comes the new deals, then comes the new clients. I think I have -- I think I have answered it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Friedman from SIG. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman - SIG", "", "Let me echo the same for Shibu. My first question is for Pravin. Pravin, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that there may be some challenges in the discretionary part of financial services apropos of your comments about Finacle. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that further?", "Pravin Rao", "So I\u2019ll pass it on to Mohit, who heads the financial services. You wanted to know about challenges in discretionary spending.", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes. So I think in financial services we\u2019ve seen a huge focus that our clients have on cost and complexity introduction. That has taken bulk of the initiative within banks. There is a focus on digital rights. So those are the only programs that are getting funded from a discretionary perspective other than regulatory programs.", "James Friedman - SIG", "Understood.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Does that answer your question?", "James Friedman - SIG", "Yes. That\u2019s a great answer. I was wondering, is that consistent with the past patterns that you have seen?", "Mohit Joshi", "I think we are hopeful that as we get into the second half of the year and if you -- if the U.S. and Europe continue to grow, then we will see a larger focus on digital and maybe less of an emphasis on cost reduction.", "James Friedman - SIG", "Understood. And then my follow-up is for Rajiv. I know you articulated your short to midterm goals with regard to utilization. I was wondering in a strategy of extreme off shoring would the company has enough opportunity to increase that utilization rate even further?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Our utilization currently is 80%. This is probably one of the highest we have seen. Our aspiration is to keep the utilization between 80% to 82%. Remember the remaining 18%, about 8% will go in different things. For example, the leave will take away about 1.5%. There is travel which will take away about 1%. About 1% or 1.5% go because of training. You have people on the buffer getting ready for projects. All of those things will take away about 8%, 8% to 9%. So all you are left with finally is about 10%. So it is important to leave the strategic bench because the customers today, the clients today are impatient. They need us to respond to their requirements much quicker than in the past. And we need strategy to win. So I would expect utilization to remain between 80% to 82%.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shashi Bhushan from Prabhudas Lilladher. Please go ahead.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Lilladher", "Shibu, commendable leadership during one of the most challenging time for the company. It was pleasure interacting with you. But my question relates to consulting and package implementation. We have seen healthy growth in our consulting and package implementation business in FY14 and Q1 FY15 as well. What is the nature of growth we are seeing in the service line and can we expect some trickle down revenue due to the same in FY15?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I will give a brief answer and give it to Pravin. Consulting and system integration programs are usually -- we do two kinds of things in consulting and system integration. One is large transformational programs, which are mostly packet led transformation, SAP and Oracle. We start the work with -- consulting work in the beginning and end with implementations, multi-country rollouts and implementations. We truly transform our clients\u2019 business. And some part of work in consulting and system integration is also the residual part of that work, which will lead us to maintaining the systems over a long period of time.", "But eventually it all comes down to consulting all the way to, making sure that the systems are running. The average lifespan on the transformational programs I believe are about nine months. So it is important for us to keep refilling the space on a continuous basis. Let me now hand over to Pravin who can give you more color on this.", "Pravin Rao", "In consulting and system integration, from a consulting perspective we see lot of opportunity as Shibu said. One part of it is around SAP and Oracle led transformation and this predominately in the manufacturing and in the CPG space. Then we are also seeing lot of opportunities across verticals on digital confirmation where consulting also plays a big role. Then our acquisition of Lodestone also has helped us and Lodestone has a lot of strength in the Life Sciences space and we are seeing a lot of success in Life Sciences due to some of the capability coming from Lodestone. So net-net, as long as we are able to tap into discretionary spend, a big part of it starts with consulting and then later on flows down to some of the other parts of the business. And in the last few quarters and even in last year we had a significant growth in our own whole consulting and system integration practice. It grew by about 19%. This quarter also has been healthy. We continue to leverage and take advantage of opportunities there. And wherever there are discretionary spends, we have a lot of opportunities for our consulting play.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Lilladher", "You highlighted about slow start in the retail, and then picked up in May and June. Did we see similar trends in other verticals as well?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. I think retail was more specific because what happened in the previous quarter was due to bad weather and other things. I think retail was impacted and we saw the overhang in April as well. So as a vector I think it was one sector which was majorly affected by the bad weather. And that\u2019s why I think we had overhang from last quarter into early this quarter. But otherwise in most of the other sectors, the challenges are different. For instance, in Life Sciences; if you look at it, the challenges are more around lack of product differentiation, more around pricing pressure from the payers and so on.", "In the telecom I think there is -- if you look at telecom sector, the challenges are on growth itself and there is tremendous pressure to cut cost. So the nature of challenges are different in different segments and within some segments, like for instance in manufacturing, auto is doing well but aerospace is challenged, and high-tech to some extend on the discretionary side is challenged. So we see varying trends across different verticals. But retail was more specific to what happened in quarter four. ", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Lilladher", "Sure. And my last question, sorry persist on this attrition stuff, but it\u2019s alarmingly high. Are we seeing challenges in project start due to high attrition?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think to a large extent if you notice, last quarter we had -- our utilization was around 75% and utilization has improved. So through that 5% to 6% or 8% GAAP we have in the utilization, we are able to at least backfill attrition. So immediately we don\u2019t foresee problems but at some point in time, particularly if we lose good skills or if we lose people, high performing people sometimes -- even though you have people, you may not have people with right fit or right capability. Sometimes it does pose challenge. But then also we always plan for around 78% to 80% utilization. So in the short-term we don\u2019t see any impact on attrition, but in the long-term obviously, we have to arrest attrition because I think we have to reduce our dependence on external hiring. It is important for us to retain some of the best people we have internally. And so from that perspective, it has, but not from a short-term perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Two quick questions. First, is regarding the Big Data. I was wondering if you could split or maybe give us some color about backend effort versus the frontend effort, and any verticals that show more interest in Big Data implementations? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "", "Let me request Sandeep to respond to this. And thank you very much for the compliment. I\u2019ve always enjoyed my interactions. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "", "Yes, this is Sandeep. I think we\u2019re seeing a mix of two types of engagements. We are seeing clients who are just experimenting with specific use cases on Big Data, trying to figure out if they can make for example, better insights in a consumer situation happen or better insights in a product analytic situation or a credit analytic situation. Once they are able to drive some maturity in many use cases, then they feel comfortable setting up a backend infrastructure and drive a Big Data factory kind of concept where the entire enterprise starts leveraging these use cases more systemically. So we are seeing this across retail CPG, financial services et cetera. But the maturity of clients varies here. We are supporting them in their journey right from initial use case pilots to larger use case factories and Big Data as in infrastructure. Hope that answers your question.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Yes. The second question I had was if we step back in history, year 2000, Y2K issues, Euro currency, that between \u201999 and 2001; they were very critical and one of the key catalysts for IT services. I was wondering, are you seeing anything similar to Y2K or anything, maybe some specific vertical that may be, if not of the same magnitude, but something similar?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think there are transformations happening in various sectors. If you look at the emergence of cloud, the emergence of -- the acceptance of a different model of proving services where the client will pay for -- pay-per-use, the emergence of Big Data and Analytics. And the corporations moving away from -- not moving away, moving from information to insights and I also believe that they will -- it will move from insights into intelligence. These moves are enormously transformational because these moves unlocks new value in business. They increase the return on investment. They make the clients much more relevant to their customers. And all of this today can only happen through technology. So the advances in mobile, social and cloud are drivers for new transformations in technology and I clearly believe that these are opportunities.", "Now when you look at different verticals, you would find that many different verticals are in different stages of adoption. So for example, if you look at retail, which I believe is a huge phenomenon, retail, whether it is omni-channel commerce, unified consumer experience, integrated online and brick and mortar services for the consumers, that is transforming the business and that is where the investments are going.", "If you look at financial services, there is risk in compliance. Now there is a move towards consumer experience in financial services and figuring out how the experience from retail can be leveraged in financial services. So different industry verticals are in different stages of evolution, of using these disruptive phenomenons and that is definitely an opportunity.", "Operator", "Thank you. Participants, that was the last question. I now hand the floor back to the management for closing comments. Thank you, and over to you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So once again this is Shibu. As I said this, is the last time I will be using this platform. It has been a pressure for me to be on this platform and interacting with all of you through the years. I have had the privilege of interacting with many of you in person over the last, almost a decade and I\u2019ve enjoyed every one of them. I really want to thank you for the trust, the affection and privilege which you have given me over the last, many, many years. I enjoyed each one of them and thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us.

Hello everyone. I\u2019m Sandeep from the Investor Relations Team in Bangalore. Welcome to the Infosys call to discuss future strategic roadmap, along with the Q2 FY\u201915 earnings release.", "Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team.

Good day everyone. Before we get into the results of this quarter, I would like to take a few minutes to give you my perspective on the road ahead for Infosys.", "I started my journey as the CEO of Infosys about 70 days ago, and each day has been a tremendous experience, simultaneously exhilarating and humbling, but also challenging and yet a familiar one.", "Infosys is an iconic company. Our company has been instrumental in putting India on the technology map, in pioneering the global delivery model, which transformed the industry and for being the engines that train the top talent in the industry, and all of this while maintaining the utmost standards of honesty and integrity which others have measured themselves by.", "As we look ahead to the next 33 years of Infosys, we not only aspire to achieve constant profitable growth as Mr. Moorthy used to say, but indeed get back to being the bellwether company for our industry, leading it in both growth and profitability. And we want to do that on the basis of innovation, on the basis of technology, especially automation and artificial intelligence technologies and on the basis of amazing people who are amplified by technology, by the knowledge, the imagination and the conviction and the community and the ecosystem they bring with them in Infosys. We believe that this will result in a much higher productivity and a deeper relevance of each individual.", "I believe that this is a human revolution. We want to bring about this revolution on a foundation of learning and on the basis of excellence with the most modern technologies such as the latest platforms and architectures and the most advanced capabilities in AI and automation and we have already started down this path.", "Artificial Intelligence as a domain is often misunderstood. It is often associated with the precipitation on the acceleration of human irrelevance. Having studied AI at Stanford and at Syracuse before that, and at the feet of the pioneers in AI, I happened to see this differently.", "This pessimistic description is not correct. Technology for centuries has always been about the amplification of us, the amplification of the human; not making them irrelevant, and AI and automation is no exception to this.", "So we see an opportunity to launch a great human revolution, where we are able to achieve much higher productivity levels, to bring much more innovation, where we are able to paraphrase Prof. Mashelkar, \u2018Do More With Less For More.\u2019 I refer to this as the next generation of services and we are building Infosys into such a next generation services company.", "Over the last 70 days I have interacted with dozens of partners, 100s of clients and tens of thousands of employees and it is very clear that the world around us is being profoundly reshaped by software and by software driven technologies.", "As a result of this and to best serve this transformation and to best achieve a relevance in the world of the future, we see every business adopting a dual strategy. On the one hand to renew their existing systems and existing landscapes and their existing businesses and at the same time complement this renewal with entering into new business areas, new business models and build completely new solutions for these, often in areas where there was never software for those before. And this duality of renew and new also applies to us at Infosys equally well. We must bring this duel opportunity to life and we must do so within the underlying fabric of our culture.", "When we think about the renew portion of this equation I believe that everyone, every company in every industry has a need to renew and rethink their existing systems and processes, to enable these systems and processes for new kinds of access, mobility, analytics and big data, sensors and adaptive behavior, as well as move this systems to the could for achieving better scalability, better economics, better elasticity.", "And for Infosys, this means a renewal of our existing business lines, whether it is consulting of BPO, whether it is application development and maintenance or infrastructure management, whether it is implementation and integrating package systems or building completely new engineered solutions, whether it is verification or implementations, everything.", "And for Infosys it also means IP excellence with our Finacle and Edge products and an investment in assembling and building platforms and tools using existing technologies, using open source technologies, using propriety technologies from our partners, as well as our own IP. But each company needs to achieve this renewal through an improvement in their own operational efficiency and productivity and for Infosys this means an investment in automation and innovation and in our own operational efficiency.", "And similarly on the new side of this equation, we see a need for every business to find new software driven ways of connecting their ecosystem and their entire value chain, and new ways to create engagement with customers and understanding of customers to explore new markets and new business models and to build systems for these that have never existed before, in new ways on new kind of technology platforms and for Infosys this new dimension means working on our information platform, working on elevating our client conversations and helping our clients find and execute against their needs of the future.", "It also means offering new kinds of services using approaches like design thinking and co-creation. It means entering into new strategic partnerships, as well as work with startups and new kinds of companies to help us fill the gaps in our own value chain and this entire renew and new has to be done on a foundation of culture of engagement and of purposeful work. At Infosys we will double down on learning and education for all of us and indeed engage in life long learning.", "Let me drill down into the renewal of our services and offering the new services in a little bit more detail. Taking a service line view, in consulting services we will leverage the glue of our platforms, our integrated services and a deep business expertise to bring the best end to end solutions to our clients and further we will apply the power of design thinking to define the future systems and solutions for our clients.", "In business process outsoaring and business process management, we will invest in the advanced application of automation and artificial inelegance, and a deep focus on process improvement, on process innovation and help accelerate our clients move to best practices across domains, as they are most trusted and reliable business partner.", "In product engineering this is a key focus for us, we will bring our unique and complementary competency in the mechanical and electronic domains, where we design the great products of the world from airplanes and airplane parts to security systems. From drills to cars, from oil fields to routers and seek to relieve the massive value that lies at the intersection of the physical and digital world.", "And once we have done the design of these kids of products. We will focus on capabilities like predictive maintenance, machine learning and intelligent and adaptive systems across industry verticals, to derive a new value across this chain from the design to the deployment of products and in doing so we will also improve the way that we bring these products to life in software, by bringing together techniques in CAD, in product design together with the software design and development experience.", "In application development, our aspiration is to rethink the development experience to improve developer productivity dramatically. We are working on the Infosys development platform that will consolidate tooling and experience and build around rapid, agile, techniques, integration of development and operations, design thinking methodology and in brining AI capabilities and new abstractions into the development and offering experience, which to a large degree has not changed over the last several decades.", "In application management and testing, we will invest in areas like automated source code analysis, automated upgrades, automated regression testing, etc\u2026 and infrastructure management, we are adopting an open plus differed approach with reference architectures, put together with our partners in infrastructure that can help us simplify the complex landscapes of our clients, as well as doing a massive embrace of artificial inelegance and automation techniques to help bring a dramatic efficiency improvement in the way infrastructure of enterprise clients is managed. We have already embarked on this journey with partnership with infrastructure players, as well as tooling companies and we will do more.", "On the product side, we are building the best-in-class core banking platform with Finacle and our focus will be to enhance the end user experience of the products and to create an ecosystem of extensions in areas like analytics, mobile banking, digital commerce and inclusive banking.", "We are seeing rapid traction with our Edge suite of products in major companies around the world, across industries, in helping achieve a dramatic new economics and ease of experience in the frontline areas that are critical to enterprises. This will continue to be an important offering from Infosys and we look forward to growing this business significantly in the coming years.", "With big data in analytics, we are proposing an Infosys Information Platform, an enterprise big data platform that combines open source software with partner technology tools, as well as our own, and we want to bring this to life at our client at a cost that is a fraction of the previous generation approaches towards these areas.", "And Infosys can enable startup companies to attain dramatic improvements in engineering speed, in scale and achieve a global reach by helping them amplify and accelerate their development as they grow and helping them achieve their engineering goals, as well as their operational goals much more efficiently and in an accelerated way.", "We will combine this extension of the engineering of startups, we\u2019ll join go-to-market with them, as well as strategic venture investments, to bring Infosys into close collaboration with today\u2019s small companies, cutting Edge companies that will be great companies of the future. And to support of these service line innovations, our strategy will be to renew and rethink our own existing systems and processes; our processes for sales and marketing, for people and talent, for IT systems and for operations and administration.", "We would focus our people agenda on the experience of our employees, on trust through empowerment and accountability, on continuous employability and on life long learning. We are aspiring to create a transparent and a meritocratic culture that empowers every single employee to do their best for our clients with an unwavering commitment to our values. We will be employee centric and are working on bringing advanced technology to a deep and wide engagement with our entire workforce, using new cloud sourcing solutions.", "We will offer a unique combination of career mobility, learning and technological challenges to retain our top talent and we will renew our workforce through diversity of every sort globally and on minimizing our distance to customer value. Often in large organizations we see an endemic where middle tiers in the organization loose their distance to this value and we are striving to minimize that as we renew ourselves.", "We will also embark on an active inorganic strategy, focus on acquiring core capabilities, not on acquiring yesterday\u2019s revenue and yesterday\u2019s technology, but in achieving efficiency in acceleration of a road map towards the future, with automatic technologies, with new thinking in collaboration and advanced new areas, as well as to expand in under penetrated and high growth markets and in new geographies that are strategic to us.", "In doing all of this we believe that we will greatly improve our competitiveness in the market, especially to win large transformational projects and to expand our relationships with each of our clients and achieve a disproportionate growth in emerging markets.", "We believe that we will better position ourselves to lead our clients into their future with relevant innovation in offering in new areas and we will increase operational excellence, so that we are able to confidently invest for growth.", "We have already started down this path, by making investment into these areas and are already seeing early results and evidence of success. We have been collaborating with universities. In the last 70 days we have established programs with Stanford for the Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, a premier provider of data science and data scientist, as well as a design school faculty members in helping establish a massive embrace of design thinking at Infosys.", "We also partnered with the East China Normal University to help teach the teachers, as well as other universities in Europe like TU Berlin in areas around working with startups and in advance technologies.", "We have been establishing partnerships with Microsoft, with Hitachi, with Huawei, as well as expanding our partnerships with Oracle and SAP. Engaging with startup companies in innovating and investing in ways to engage with our employees such as the Murmuration, an initiative that we launched and we already have a few dozen POCs going of the Infosys information platform and on Big Data.", "All of this tells us that a new, a next generation services company is on the horizon. We believe that a company that brings in capabilities such as the ones that I have outlined will be a next generation services company. We believe that Infosys can not only be such a next generation services company, but can once again define what it means to be an IT services company. A great company based on innovation, that is founded based on a foundation of intellect and values.", "We, myself our entire leadership team, our board and the entire employee population of Infosys is 100% committed to these goals and we look forward to the rest of the journey. In the coming quarters I look forward to sharing with you more detailed plans of our execution on these strategies and more tangible articulation on what these strategies will mean for our business, our investment and their expected outcomes.", "Let me now talk about the business highlights for the second quarter of this fiscal year. Our U.S. dollar revenue grew 3.1% as reported and 3.9% in constant currency. Our growth was quire broad, across most of our industry verticals, across geographies and across service offerings. By itself our services business grew by 3.6% in reported currency and 4.4% in constant currency.", "Our Finacle business did not have such a great quarter and posted a 5.4% decline in a quarter-on-quarter basis. We have taken action to elevate this. We have just announced a leadership change. Michael Reh has now taken over as the Head of the Finacle business will be executing plans on several fronts to return this business to growth and success as in outlined earlier.", "Volume growth for this quarter was 3.0% and per capita revenue growth for IT services was 0.6% in reported terms and 1.3% in constant currency terms. Our operating margin for the quarter, went up by 100 basis points to 26.1%. This is good, because it allows us to better plan our investments for growth and this is despite one time investments that we have made that Rajiv will outline later.", "Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, which is a quarter-over-quarter growth of 6%. We added 49 new clients during the quarter. The gross employee addition was over 14,000.", "We have taken several initiatives over the last few months to address some of the attrition issues that we have had and these are now beginning to yield positive results, with attrition declining month over month during this quarter.", "This continues to be an important area of attention for us. Our quarterly performance has enabled us to pay our employees on average 100% of the bonus for Q2 for the first time in 16 quarters.", "As mentioned earlier, winning large annuity engagements continues to be an important part of our strategy. During this quarter we signed seven large deals with a TCV of $600 million; five deals were in the Americus, one in Europe and one elsewhere in the world. Two were in financial services and one each in Retail, Manufacturing, Telecom, Life Sciences and Energy and Utility.", "The overall deal pipeline and decision cycles have remained steady over the last three months. Pricing also remains stables in most areas. Some commodity areas are seeing a downward pressure, whereas other innovative areas have opportunities for us to deliver and achieve much great value.", "Our products and platforms business which was established as EdgeVerve Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Infosys in the last quarter is seeing increased momentum with prospects and clients and we see great opportunities for EdgeVerve as I articulated earlier.", "We have maintained our revenue guidance for financial year 2015 to 7% to 9% despite significant cross currency movements during the year. As you can see, we had a very good quarter, one that we are proud of, and as I mentioned in my strategy description earlier, we are looking forward to growth in the coming quarters and to sharing with you additional details as we go forward and build out a deeper operational plan based on the strategies that I have mentioned.", "With that, let me hand over to my colleague and my friend and our COO, Pravin.", "Pravin Rao ", "Thanks Vishal. Let me talk about highlights in various business segments. In financial services we had a growth of 2.5% on constant currency basis quarter-on-quarter for the services part. Other challenges remain in this sector with many banks looking at cutting back spend on both, Run the Business and Change the Business programs. There is intense focus on efficiency improvements, as well as spend in the areas of risk and compliance, client facing initiative, digital and new products. Recent cycles are slightly faster compared to 12 months back.", "In the insurance, Digital and Big Data are gaining prominence along with analytics. New demand and deal pipeline in the sector is good. In cards and payments, digital and technology modernizations are the top two trends. There is a lot of focus on security given this state of breaches of late.", "Retail and CPG continues to see challenges due to postponement of large initiatives and long duration cycles. While pipeline is healthy, there are delays in ramp-ups of programs won earlier. Retailers are extensively focusing on digital commerce and analytics, while CPG companies are focusing on cost reductions and brand building.", "In manufacturing, there is an increase in spend in high-tech lead by ISVs, Telco OEMs and devices and equipment. Trend in industrial manufacturing in also increasing, while auto is flat and aerospace is experiencing a reduction in spend. Growth in the sector is largely driven by Americus on both discretionary and non-discretionary sides.", "In telecom the industry trends remain similar to last quarter, with decline in top-line in both wire line and wireless, squeezing spend and triggering consolidation in the sector. LAN focus is on customer experience improvement, churn reduction and operational efficiency. While we say another quarter of strong in quarter two, we expect growth challenges in the upcoming quarters as mentioned earlier.", "In energy, while super majors are focusing on improved operation efficiency, oil field services clients are witnessing, increased activity in the international market. Clients are looking for efficiency improvement, application rationalization and better business intelligence.

There is a significant reduction in discretionary spend. Deal pipeline are showing some improvement, though division cycles remain similar to last quarter.", "In growth markets there is a demand for utility based pricing and asset service models. There is an increase in combined IT BPO deals and cloud infrastructure deals.", "Deal pipeline and division cycles remain steady. In BPO client conversations are more around transformation of the business processes, with clients looking up to service providers to take end-to-end ownership of that processes. Though cost continued to drive outsourcing, discussions around value and domain expertise are becoming predominant.", "Finacle growth was impacted during this quarter due to delay in deferment of closure of some of the large deals. Markets for Finacle continues to remain soft due to its discretionary orientation and client preference being towards step changes rather than large transformations.", "In cloud and infrastructure services, demand is high and adoption of public cloud in on the rise. Our strategy to help simplify and industrialize client operations and helping them avoided to leverage Digital and cutting Edge technologies is a clear differentiator.", "We have been rated as a challenger in the Gartner rating for 2014 for North American Data Center Outsourcing, which is a significant improvement from operation in 2012.", "With regards to digital, we had strong growth in quarter two in Americus, led largely by retail and CPG and manufacturing verticals. Digital is on top of our agenda for most plans, thereby leading to strong demand.", "I will now hand over to Rajiv to talk about financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal ", "Thank you, Pravin. For the next few minutes I\u2019ll take you through the financial highlights for the quarter.", "Revenue for the quarter was at $2.201 billion as against $2.133 billion last quarter, which is a sequential increase of a growth of 3.1%.", "During the quarter major global currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. For example, the euro depreciated about 3.8%, Australian about 1.7% and GBP by 1.5%. This has impacted our reported growth by approximately $16 million during the quarter; revenue growth in constant currency is at 3.9%.", "It is important to note that the revenue growth for IT services alone was at 3.6% in reported terms and 4.4% in constant currency terms. The Finacle and BPO continued to have growth challenges. BPO grew by only 0.7% during the quarter. While the softer growth in BPO was cyclical and we expect it to recovery in the coming quarters, the Finacle continues to have growth challenges something that we are aware off and are working on the product.", "It has sequentially declined by 5.4% during the quarter. On the margin front, the rupee has deprecated by 1.3%, against the U.S. dollar during the quarter, which has resulted in a positive impact of 0.3% on operating margins during the quarter. Our gross margins for the quarter were at 38.5% as against 37% last quarter.", "Operating margins for the quarter went above 100 basis points, to 26.1%, net margins for the quarter was at 23.2% compared to 22.6% last quarter. The increasing operating margins were primarily driven by an increase of 2.2% in utilization from 80.1% last quarter to 82.3% in the current quarter, an improvement in on-site mix from 29.2% in the previous quarter to 28.7% in this quarter and the rupee depreciation that I spoke about earlier.", "The expansion in margin is after making significant investments in the business during the quarter. We promoted around 12,000 employees during the quarter, the highest we have done in any single quarter in the history. We will be paying as Vishal mentioned, an average of 100% bonus to our employees during the quarter.", "We have increased our investments in customer delivery, education and training and in sales. We contributed $30 million U.S. dollars to Infosys Foundation for the quarter ended 30 September 2014 for CSR activities.", "Other income for the quarter was at $144 million U.S. dollars, which included a ForEx gain of $24 million. Yield on other income was at 9.34% during the quarter. We have outstanding hedges of $1.027 billion as on September 30, 2014. Effective tax rate for the quarter was at 29%.", "Cash and cash equivalent, including available for sale assets and certificates on deposits were at $5.443 billion as on September 30. We saw good collections during the quarter as the results of which, the DSO for the quarter dropped to 62 days as compared to 66 days last quarter.", "I\u2019m happy to inform you that the broad has declared an interim dividend of INR 30 per share, which will be approximately $0.49 based on the currency exchange rates. The Infosys Board has also recommended a one is to one bonus of issue of equity shares and one is to one stock dividend of American Depositary shares to increase liquidity of the share and expand the shareholder base.", "I\u2019ll briefly touch up on the outlook for FY \u201915. The guidance for the year has been maintained at 7% to 9% in spite of significant cross currency moment between the last few months.", "As you would have noticed, the present markets have been extremely volatile and more of the major currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollars. For example, the euro has depreciated by 8.8% against the U.S. dollar between March and September. The Australian dollar has depreciated by 5.7% and Swiss Franc by 7.9% during the same period.", "On the margin front we have seen an expansion in margins during the quarter on account of strong operational performance. Historically Q3 and Q4 has been soft quarters for us. We continued to make substantial investments in our business to accelerate and sustain our growth. We expect the operating margins to continue to be around 25% for the year, plus or minus 1%. However, the seen may vary quarter-on-quarter depending on our investment requirements.", "With that, I\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Co", "Yes, thank you very much. First is for Dr. Sikka. Based on the steps you are planning to take to transform the business, how should we think about it in the fee margin (inaudible) years and then also in the long run (inaudible) beyond. Second one for Rajiv, well speaking (ph) about the application, how should we think about utilization for fiscal year 2015 versus hiring time and thank you and best of luck?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Moshe, let me address the first part of your question and then for the second one Rajiv can answer that, but it wasn\u2019t very clear, so perhaps when I\u2019m done with my answer you can repeat your second question.", "So with regard to the growth ahead and the margins, as Rajiv said, we are presently maintaining our margin outlook. The strategy that I have outlined, it will take time for this to take shape and to start getting reflected in a meaningful way in the P&L.", "Having said that, and over the next couple of quarters, we are going to further outline this in much more detail and quantitatively to give you better guidance, both in terms of investments and capital allocations, as well as in terms of the forecast on growth and outlooks.", "Having said that, we do feel very confident about the long-term growth of the strategy, the long-term growth, as well as profitability of the strategy that we have outlined. Such that new service and the next generation services company, as I envision Infosys to become \u2013 would see a significant growth, as well as profitability at the same time.", "And one other point that I would like to make is, as we detail this and given the inherent latencies in the business even though the results will take time to get there, we are already seeing the first early signs of success of the strategy in an engagement that we are starting to do with clients, both in terms of renewing our existing services, as well as bringing new services to life.", "So the journey ahead is going to be one where it will take some time to achieve the meaningful impact but at the same time we are going to get there incrementally and not that the results will show up in a big bang down the line.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Okay and then the second part, that\u2019s for Rajiv. As I said, at current utilizations, it\u2019s at peak levels right now. Should we expect these to move higher or should be (inaudible) hiring right now given the demand that you are seeing.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Moshe, I\u2019ll try answering, but I couldn\u2019t get the complete question. I think the line is not very clear. But our utilization for the quarter is at 82.3%, which is an all time high. I haven\u2019t seen this kind of utilization over the last many, many years.", "As we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters, I had been always maintaining that \u2013 I believe that the right utilization will be about 80% to 82% and over the last couple of quarters we have taken a lot of initiatives to reach that number.", "Having said that, I think there is a need to make investments. We have to hire ahead of time, we have to hire for the growth that see in the next year, and as a result you would see us investing more in the business, hiring more people, hiring the right skill set and that would mean that they could be in the short terms, some impact on the margins because of hiring ahead of the curve.", "Having said that, I think there is a lot of focus in the company on automation, on productivity improvements and this is an environment where it\u2019s not early to get pricing increase from the customer on a year on year basis. So we have to drive productivity improvement on automation, to drive better value for our clients, at the same time improve our margins on an ongoing basis.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Thank you again and best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi. My first question is just on the growth prospects for the company. I think you trailed industry growth rate for a little while and I think the initiative was to get back over those industry growth rates. Can you just revisit that particular issue and is this about improving the prospects of the core business before, you know the new plan or is this about putting both forwarded at the same time.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Joseph, it is about putting both forward at the same time, to simultaneously renew our existing business and achieve a much better efficiency, innovation and operational excellence out of that, but at the same time complement that and augment that with a new set of services that we offer, a new set of innovative capabilities that we offer, so that the sum total of that would help us achieve over time industry leading growth and profitability, which has been our target.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay and then on the attrition side, it ticked up this quarter despite I think the increased bonuses. Can you talk a little bit about why the rate continued to pick-up and what are you expecting for the attrition rate to do over the long term.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Joseph, the attrition on an LTM basis is still, is a little bit above 20% and that continues to be of concern for us. However we have taken many steps around attrition and if you look at the month over month numbers, they have already declined, so it heading in the right direction.", "As I had mentioned, when I started the actions that we talk around attrition will take some time to take shape because of the long nature of these latencies of people deciding and then going through the process of leaving and so forth.", "So we are seeing encouraging signs here when we look at it on a month by month basis that the attrition is coming and we feel confident that both based on the measures that we have taken to improve our position on attrition, as well as now the strategy around growth and the results and we believe that a combination of these will over time bring us back down to the levels that are more normal for us in the industry.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay and then the last question from me. You laid out a fairly ambitious plan for the business and given the fact that it\u2019s been a services company for a long period of time, it seems like that culture will be changing a bit. Can you just layout for us a couple of organizational changes that you feel need to take place in order to be successful and what you think the impact of those changes will be?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t see any cyclical changes in the organization any time soon. The team, our management team, this has been my first quarter. This has been the first quarter for us to work together. It has been a great experience; it has been an amazing experience. We have a young dynamic, passionate team that is driven towards success and it has been a great experience for me to work with our team and I look forward to that.", "Of course as you see in the example with Finacle, as we see an opportunity to make changes and take corrective actions, we will do so swiftly. But I don\u2019t see any structural reason to make any changes at this time. I think our team is fully equipped to go after this agenda that I have outlined.", "A key part to getting to kind of transformation that we are talking about, is to ensure that we continue to focus on education. Infosys is a company that heavily values education and training and learning. I believe that education is at the heart of any company\u2019s transformation.", "After all if you think about it, any company that goes through a fundamental change in its business had to reeducate, has to retrain, reskill their workforce, has to get their employees to think differently about the role of the future and has to take those actions. So therefore learning and education is always at the heart of any company\u2019s transformation, but it especially true for Infosys where education has always been at the heart of what we do.", "Mr. Moorthy, our Founder, you should talk about learnability, the ability to learn as the thing that is fundamental to Infosys. 20 years ago we did not have BPO or IMS or services like this. Who knows what kinds of services we\u2019ll have 10 to 15 years from now, but we will have education then, just as we had education 20 years ago.", "So a strong focus on education and on learning is at the heart of our ability to transform ourselves, to be able to do these kinds of things that I have outlined and we have already taken major steps in this direction. We have been teaching, design thinking to our company. We have already started that in a massive way, in partnership with many faculty and professors from Standford\u2019s d. school and the D Global initiative.", "We have already done the first training classes of design thinking for our executive management and many of our senior management members, leaders of our consulting teams, leaders of our sales teams. We have already done the first sessions of training some of our great teachers, our trainers on design thinking and as we speak we are launching a massive embrace of design thinking for all Infosians and I expect that before the end of this year, we will have trained 25,000 Infosys employees on design thinking.", "Similarly we are doing a huge embrace of artificial intelligence based on the CS 188 class out of Berkeley. We have been putting together a great new artificial intelligence class. I am myself doing \u2013 hoping to find some time to do some of these computer science classes and so on.", "So we are looking into not only using education and investing and doubling down on education as a great mechanism for our organizational transformation, but we are also looking to invest in education itself and in finding new ways to train and so forth. So more so than the management, I would advice looking at our ability to educate and to train as a great mechanism for our organizational transformation.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "Yes, hi Vishal. Your commentary and vision on the whole artificial intelligence is quite interesting. Can you share a couple of key areas where Infosys could benefit materially? I mean, what is the nature of jobs in this artificial intelligence paradigm. And also as a follow-up, you talked about investments. Can you share with us what would be the nature of some of these investments? Thanks.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "We see AI as impacting many of our lines of businesses in a very fundamental way. If you look at infrastructure management for example, automation and rule based systems and so forth can have a tremendous impact in how a landscape can be managed automatically or more or less automatically where people can manage these by exception.", "If you look at BPO, many processes which are based on documents and voice can be revolutionized with the iTechnique, with voice processing, with text processing and image recognition and so forth, as well as rule based systems and machine learning to understand and detect correct behavior and taking actions based on that behavior.", "So we believe that our existing services can be significantly improved by embracing AI techniques there, as well as of course in completely new kinds of applications that we can build in complex areas and intelligent adaptive sense and response type behaviors, whether it is machines and machine based systems, whether it is in connected cars or connected vehicles, airlines, all systems where we design the system and then the system is in production, where it can be integrated into a intelligent adaptive system, can have a significant impact from AI.", "So the kinds of jobs there are around of course managing my exception, around modeling. Modeling of systems and system behavior, creating rules, creating the constrains around which learning can happen, these are some very high paying, high skill jobs that we are looking forward to having within Infosys and I think that that can have a great impact, both of the existing services as well as new areas that we can go into and we are starting that training in earnest.", "By the way, one other area that we are extremely excited about is in language processing, natural language processing, using the same information platform that I talked about earlier with open source components. We see a great opportunity in industries like insurance or banking, where automatic analysis of new stories and extraction of events and events of significance, whether it is on the risk side or on the growth side can have a great impact to our business and we are already starting to do projects in these areas.", "On the investment side, I would not limit it to any particular area. We are excited about many areas. Of course in the AI techniques and these kinds of automation techniques, as well as in new ways of collaborating, because remote work forces and remote abilities to work together are of great interest to us.", "So we are looking in many areas like that, as well as in under penetrated areas of verticals; some areas in energy, in healthcare in detail and in many geographies as well. So I wouldn\u2019t put any particular area or a segment as a focus for investment, just a broad interest in participating in the growth of other companies.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "And if you don\u2019t mind, if I squeeze one small question again. Can we expect M&A on some of these initiatives by Infosys over the next several quarters?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "Thanks a lot and best of luck Vishal.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thank you Anil.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rishi Jhunjhunwala of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs", "Yes hi, thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 Vishal, this question is for you; just a sense of conversations that you have been having with the customers and with the employees in INFY over the past 70 days. What are the key concerns that have been highlighted by the customers regarding INFY and the key issues that would have been raised by employees during your conversation? And as a follow-up, what were your responses to them and did anything come as an unexpected surprise. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "That\u2019s a great question. I think that all the clients that I talked to increasingly and this differed across industries, but increasingly all the clients that we talked to no longer have the patience for what we could call Yesterday\u2019s Services. They don\u2019t want to have staff augmentation or labor arbitrage, simply for the sake of saving costs. They aspire to have improvements in business processes, better outcomes.", "They want to learn what new ways are of running processes, of running businesses efficiently, they want to understand how to innovate and they want to help in getting into new areas. So if anything, their primary frustration is in not having a more innovative mindset, not having a more open mindset towards how business outcomes can be improved, how business process excellence can be achieved and things of that nature.", "In other words, I have across my interactions with several hundred clients, have seen a tremendous dissatisfaction with the way IT services of yesterday use to be and a tremendous desire to engage on new kinds of ways of bringing value and innovation and so forth.", "And with employees it is a similar thing. They look for a great purpose to work on innovative projects, to work on next generation kinds of things. They also look for simpler, efficient ways of working, efficient systems, efficient processes and so on. So we have been focusing heavily on that, on dramatically simplifying our own complexities, on improving our operational efficiency and things of that nature and over time, as these things become more concrete and some of the results start to become more visible, we look forward to sharing those with you.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo", "Thank you. Good evening. I guess my question is on capital deployment with $5.2 billion in cash and well over $1 billion in cash generated every year. Could you update us on your cash dividend payout strategy? Maybe as a percent of cash flow what you might want to direct towards acquisitions and whether a repurchase, stock repurchase is a part of the board consideration. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Maybe I can start and then Rajiv, you can answer this in more detail. First of all well, we are very proud of the $5.4 billion in cash that we have and we believe \u2013 first of all we believe that it is a little bit early to make a more precise statement about this. I and our management have not yet had enough time to sufficiently articulate in detail the strategies that I have laid out. We will do so over the next couple of quarters and so around the April timeframe where we start our financial year, I would expect to be able to give more precise answers on capital allocation and things of this nature.", "Having said that, as you can tell, I have a very innovation oriented mindset here. We see Infosys as an innovation driven company, as a growth driven company and we see tremendous opportunity to leverage that cash that we have towards these objectives. Rajiv.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Hi. So Vishal said, I think its \u2013 we have to wait to detail out our plans, what Vishal has laid out as a high level strategy today. We have to work on our business plans, on the execution strategy, on what kind of allocation of capital that we do between different strategies and different execution engines that we want to come out with and only after that will it be appropriate for us to be able to say exactly how much of the cash is going to be accessed or not or whether its going to be less than what we need.", "Having said that, the board every quarter during their derivation look at the capital deployment and as and when they feel appropriate, I think they will take the right decision.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo", "Right. My other question is your talking about a real change in personality for Infosys and your going to work with your deployment group on the knowledge side. What about your sales organization? Can you adjust the capabilities of the group you have or will you have to seek significant outside talent to execute on your strategy. Thanks.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "And just as on the operational side, we are in the process of revitalizing our sales team, our sales and marketing functions towards this type of operational excellence, towards being able to articulate values to do solutioning, to be able to get into new areas to do design thinking together with plans, to do co-creation. So that means the same rescaling that we have talked about in other areas has to also apply to the sales part of the organization and we are already working on this.", "As I mentioned, the first set of trainings in these new areas for the leadership of sales has already happened, derivative of consulting has already happened. But as we go forward we will also be adjusting our processes, the way we manage the pipelines, the mine accounts, the way we \u2013 to change the level of the dialogue that we have directly, to go engage more with the CXO suite, as well as the compensation structures and things of that nature.", "So we are looking at \u2013 we have already started this. So Mr. Moorthy started this more than a year ago and we are going to continue that heavily, because we believe that we will need a world-class sales operational and sales and operational excellence in order to achieve the objectives that we have talked about.", "However I do believe that we have the elements in place already, so that this rescaling and this transformation can be done from within and we don\u2019t need to do a structural change to do that.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "Hi, thank you. I have two as well if I could. The first one is you talked about the financial services industry. Could you talk a little bit out, is this more Infosys or is this a broad base impact across the industry and related to that if you could talk about, you mentioned a new leadership change. What are the objectives there, what\u2019s the strategy thing to kind of revitalize growth and then I have a follow-up please.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So I think that you have to separate the financial services vertical performance from the finacle performance. Finacle is our core banking product and the product suite where we had a very dissatisfying quarter and we have made a leadership change. We have brought in a great new leader with Michael Reh to run the Finacle business and we expect that this business will get back to growth and success.", "We have a great installed base in Finacle with almost 180 banks around the world servicing 0.5 billion people and it is if you look at analysts reports and so forth it is, view it as the best and if its not one of the best banking products in the world. So we are very excited about that. I mean we have had issues with this over the last few quarters and we have already taken an action there.", "With regard to the broader financial services business, this continues to be a great business for us and is growing and I\u2019ll ask Mohit who runs our financial services business to talk more about it.", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes, I think on the financial services business, it has grown by 2.5% quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis. We have grown much faster than Europe and I think what we\u2019re seeing is there are four key trends that we\u2019ve spoken about even earlier, which is industrialization, digital, risk and compliance and infrastructure modernization, and so I think for the second half of the year we remain cautiously optimistic on the opportunities.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "But you didn\u2019t mention what the issue was and you said you are fixing it, but I didn\u2019t hear what the issue was over the past couple of quarters.", "Mohit Joshi", "The issues of Finacle have been basically across the board from the development and operations to sales, the efficiency of the development processes. It was simply a IC that as an organization that it sort of stalled a little bit and its stagnated and you saw that in the business performance over the last few quarters and so we believe that with a great leader, with a development in an innovation oriented mindset, we will be able to get this business back to growth fairly quickly.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Let me ask my follow-up then. As you mentioned in interesting roadmap surrounding investment opportunities, could you at least give us some perspective on how long into areas like AI, what\u2019s the investment period that you envisioned. Is this a multi year cycle of investments and if it is such, would you anticipate at least directionally that margins would decline during this investment cycle. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t have a very precise answer for you on the AI one. I think my sense is that it is going to be a multi year effort. We will detail this out over the next couple of quarters to be more precise about it. However we will go about this in a very swift and efficient way. In a very incremental and iterative way as we bring these to life.", "Some of the solutions that I talked about, like an area of bringing AI techniques to helpdesk or to language processing for applications in insurance and banking and so forth, these we have already started on. But to do a much more massive embrace like the kind that I have in mind will take multiple years.", "In other areas like in Big Data, we are already seeing \u2013 I mean we have a few dozen POCs going already with huge clients around the platform that I mentioned, which brings together an assemble of open source based technology. There is a lot of exciting work happening there together with proprietary and our partner technologies in information processing. To bring great new Big Data analytical solutions to life and we have already started to work with our clients in this area and that work is something that we are really excited about.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Hi. Vishal, my question was I was hoping to get your perspective on the software landscape and what I want to know is, do you think that your software partners will be more or less important in the future of Infosys than they have been in the past?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "They will continue to be significantly important to us. We work in an ecosystem. Our clients work in an ecosystem. Their landscapes are not only heterogeneous, they are permanently heterogeneous. They are going to look at a company like us as a neutral provider of advice and guidance, as well as help in managing these heterogeneous landscapes. So we ourselves in that light and we see ourselves in a very symbiotic relationship with our ecosystem partners and I continue to see the strength of that going forward.", "We do see in the new side of the equation, in the next generation solutions we see a tremendous embrace of open source products of new platforms, what many people call the third platform and so forth and these are much more cloud oriented, cloud scale, open source based technology platforms which have a much higher, a much different cost performance profile compared to the traditional interface platforms.", "So in that sense, in the new areas I think that you will see more and more work done on these kind of approaches, but working together with an ecosystem of partners and especially software partner, its fundamental to the Infosys story and will continue to be the case.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ravi Menon of Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking", "Thank you for the opportunity. There are two questions, one is due for Vishal and the other is for the CFO. One is, Vishal spoke of the sales leadership already adding some new talent and could you elaborate how your deepening your ability on the sales side to understand customer needs. For instance are you hiring senior technologists with experience in the domains like CIO is from a particular segment like retail for instance.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, we have been adding new talent across, especially in the higher ranks of our health organizations to bring in more domain expertise, to bring in more expertise in solutioning and so on and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But increasingly we see a need for clients who see us as advisors, especially in new areas and to do that we need to bring in the new kinds of skills in co-creation, in thinking together and working together with clients on what next generation problems are like.", "We are already starting to do engagements like this. Many of our leaders are working on things of this nature, so perhaps I can ask Sandeep who has been doing this in the retail and CPG area, to share his experience and how his sales team has been able to do some of these kinds of engagements already in new areas.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Sure. This is Sandeep and what we\u2019ve been doing is inducting talent from MBA universities at the lower levels and at the senior levels, also going through design thinking training on the lines of some of our new solutions.", "If you take the new Infosys information platform as an example, that we launched literally a few weeks ago, even in the few weeks that have ensued, the sales team has gone out and had multiple dozens of conversations and already engaged in multiple proof of concepts with clients to prove these new platforms out and then engage at a larger scale. So there is both, outside talent coming in, as well as internal talent being trained and aggressively running campaigns with new, more powerful solutions. Thank you.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking", "Thanks. I appreciate the clarification. Secondly, Rajiv, if you could clarify, there was any room for cutting talent in the G&A side, because last quarter you had a real 1.5% in the portion for impairment foreseeables, but this quarter I see your G&A is still flat Q-o-Q. So is there any room for leverage there to offset some of the sales and marketing investments?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, we continuously keep looking at opportunities for optimizing our costs further and G&A is one area where we have optimized over the last many, many quarters. I think we also have to ensure that we drive more productivity and improve our processes in the G&A area. So that is one area that we continuously keep looking at.", "But again if you compare it with the rest of the industry, I think it\u2019s the lowest in the industry. Even if your able to optimize costs further, it may not be very significant on the P&L. So we have to look at cost optimization all across our management, be it the (inaudible) organization, the sales organization, in the best functions. So I think that\u2019s something that we do on an ongoing basis.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking", "Great, thank you. Best of luck!", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Karan Uppal of Equirus Securities. Please go ahead.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Yes, hi. I have a couple of questions here. So first I wanted to ask them, when you\u2019re trying to implement the consulate designed thinking, which you find that again stand and binds more exploratory thinking around any kind of solution. So in a timeframe of the services business generally you could deliver it in a short period of time on a specified deadline, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a radical change in the way it could be implemented successfully in this business model?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t see that as a radical change. I see that as an evolution of the way that we create opportunity in new areas. I see that as a great methodology for helping our clients think through what their approach needs to be in some of these unchartered, unprecedented kinds of new territories and new containers that they need to get into and that applies to every industry as they go through the digital transformation.", "So in many ways I guess you could say that I see that as an inevitability that we have to do that and when you look at it operationally, that takes the shape of something that is complementary to the normal traditional services, so you would say I have a handful of design projects which are small, incremental, rapidly done, but high value and high margin.", "Complement the existing kinds of services that are happening at the same client and increasingly we\u2019ll see sort of this mix off of these things, where design thinking is used to on the one hand improve the existing services that we bring and existing projects that are going on and on the other hand to do new short time window, highly iterative, high value projects that are in new areas and therefore of significant importance to clients and we\u2019ll see a mix of both of these.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Okay. The other question was more on the BPO side. So recently we have seen and as you have also pointed out in your opening remarks, that companies, including the IT vendors have been kind of building on acquiring these so called industrialized platforms and then offering it on a pay as you go model to the end users. So this is the future of business scenario if you envision it to be likely. ", "Would that create a case where a winner take all paradigm for the guide who holds the so called successful platform in a specific vertical or will there be room for everybody to participate in that kind of movement?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "It is too early to tell. I would see definitely an opportunity where someone who can offer a much more integrated stack with a next generation business process management offering, which has heavy use of improvement built into it using automation and artificial intelligence, together with the ability to run that infrastructure and the associated applications and so forth could have an advantage.", "On the other hand, clients might also decide that putting too much into the hands of one vendor might be too risky and so my sense is that you\u2019ll see a mix of those, but it is too early to tell. This idea of integrated IT and BPO or Business Process as a service is still very early and we are seeing signs of these opportunities emerge on both sides where some where clients have a very clear partitioning across the kinds of offerings and others where we do the integrated offerings.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Okay. If I can just squeeze a last one for Rajiv or just two. One, was that how do we read in your client metrics. We have like the $300 million going from one to zero, how should we read that? And secondly if you can just help us with the margin bridge for the quarter?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes, on the margin \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second part first. On the margin if you look at it during the quarter, utilization improved by 2.3% and the rupee had also depreciated by about \u2013 the rupee had depreciated during the quarter, which had given us a benefit of about 0.3% of the margin. Those put together actually helped us improve our bidding margins by about 100 basis points. What was the first one?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "$300 million client.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes, on the $300 million client, this is calculated on an LTM basis and it depends on the run rate of the client over the last four quarters. So the largest client has dropped off from a $300 million client it is about $290 million or you know typically it depends on the run rate. Four quarters back there was a revenue, which was good or bad. Depending on the clients the total revenue from client would keeps shifting.", "So again, on a quarter to quarter basis there\u2019s not much to look into it, but yes, the good part is that if you look at the $1 million clients and the $5 million clients and the $10 million clients, I think the numbers have been increasing consistently with the last many quarters and that is something which gives us the confidence about the future.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Okay, thanks. Thanks gentlemen. All the best!", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you. Vishal, good message on the automation and digitization fronts , I sort of agree with you on both these trends, but one of the things is that both digitalization and automation implies a major change from the current FTE basis of thinking and when you kind of correlate that with your own experience speaking with clients in the last 70 days, where you say many of these clients are unhappy with the old style of outsourcing, are these clients \u2013 how willing are these clients to change sort of the way they contract with you and go from a FTE basis to maybe a different basis.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "It is a mix. So there are clients of course in certain industries and certain geographies who see a great need for this, an urgency to do these new kinds of projects, whereas in other industries and other geographies they are looking at these, they are experimenting with them, but they continue with the existing one. So it is a kind of a distribution of, you could say innovative from the ones that need the most urgency, depending on the nature of the situation.", "In those cases where they do see the urgency of the outgoing innovative projects, we see a tremendous willingness to try out new models, new ways of articulating the value or sharing the value or having us share a portion of the value that is created and new ways of contracting to achieve that and so forth.", "And so it is a mix and I think that you have to adopt a kind of a tiered strategy depending on the nature of the client and the depending on where they are in their evolution of their particular business and how they see their business evolving. This is one of the areas that we will articulate in more detail over the next couple of quarters as our large-scale sales strategy towards these approaches becomes clearer.", "Presently what we are doing is, with early adopters we are engaging in these kinds of projects like the few dozen big data projects that I talked about or the adoption of artificial intelligence or connected car and things of this nature. So as the early success of those early adopters gets us into more and more experience that we then use to drive more scale in those businesses.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it. And then a more near term question. You added 49 clients this quarter. As I look at the number of clients added in the last eight quarters on average, that number is 59. I know it can jump up and down, but 49 I think is probably the lowest number since 2Q\u201913 for you guys. Is there anything to read into that with regards to maybe what\u2019s going on? Is this a result of maybe sales force turnover or what\u2019s going on here?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No, no, no. I wouldn\u2019t read any of that into it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. Could you elaborate on what\u2019s going on?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think there are many factors that go into new kinds of deals, into sizes of deals and how the contracting processes are like and so forth. So depending on the nature of the deals that happen to be in the pipeline or near closure in that particular time period is what determines the number of deals that we get in a quarter, so it is always a mix of these things. So the fact that the number of deals is what it is, my sense of it is this is of no consequence. Perhaps Pravin, you can add something to that.", "Pravin Rao", "We actually have added a lot of bandwidth to the sales as well. We have added 150 account managers. We have added about 170 people, sales folks where we hired from leading business schools in the US. So we have increased the sales bandwidth, so I think it\u2019s not a secular turn, so I don\u2019t think we should be leading too much into it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it. Understood. Thank you guys and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rishabh Chudgar of Enam Holdings. Please go ahead.", "Nihar Shah - Enam Holdings", "Hi sir. This is Nihar Shah here from Enam Holdings. I just had one question. In terms of your strategy that you\u2019ve outlined, can you sort of elaborate a little bit on how that will impact the future hiring. In the sense, would it be more towards the lateral versus freshers and how do you see that sort of also impacting the pyramid as you execute on your strategy over a three to five year timeframe. That\u2019s all from my side.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think in the near term it is too early to say that there is any structural change to how we hire. We are simply committed to diversify the global, the workforce that we have in all major dimensions, but I would not see a significant change in the hiring, simply because the nature of the new things is such that it is still very, very small and very early.", "I mean typically at Infosys we hire close to 10,000 people in the near and if we hire a couple of hundred data scientists and so forth, it doesn\u2019t really change the overall picture that much, even though it is an incredibly strategic area for us. So I wouldn\u2019t see a great change in the mix of hiring in the near term, however we are very committed to diversifying the nature of our workforce, bringing in additional talent in many different areas, whether it is in geographies or in new skills and so forth and we will continue to do that.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. That\u2019s all from my side. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Due to time constraints we will not be able to take any further questions. We thank you all for joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again. Have a good weekend ahead.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Avishek Lath of Infosys. Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Avishek Lath", "Hello. Thanks, Manita. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am Avishek from Investor Relations in Bangalore. We thank you all for joining us today to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2011. Joining us today in this conference are the CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan; along with the other members of senior management.", "We will start with a brief statement on the performance of the company during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, outlook for the quarter and the year ending March 31, 2012, and subsequently we can open up the discussion for Q&A.", "Before I hand over to Infosys management, I would like to remind you that anything we speak which refers to our outlook for the future is forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. The full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filing with SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I will now pass it on to Mr. Shibulal.", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure talking to all of you. Thank you for your attendance in the call. We had a pretty good quarter. Q3 was pretty good. We grew by 4.4% in constant currency and 3.4% in reported currency. Volume grew by 3.1% from 2.1%. Our margins are up 28% to 31% this quarter. In the last quarter, it\u2019s 28%. Our pricing is stable. Year-on-year, our pricing has gone up by 5%, that means on a year-on-year basis, we have been able to bypass the revenue collection with the increase.", "Areas of investment are growing fast, nonetheless. Europe, it\u2019s all good growth, life science and healthcare has grown above our average. Client addition has been very strong. We have 49 new clients which we added this quarter out of the six are Fortune 500.", "Over the last nine months, we have added 120 new clients. We saw very strong client addition. It\u2019s also shows that we have \u2013 it also shows that clients are choosing us and that will be a great thing for us when the time comes where they start spending much more aggressively. And they start taking the business when they start spending much more aggressively, we will be the partner of choice. And that is what we are seeing by adding 120 new clients.", "Pricing as I said, went up by 5% year-on-year. Actually, interestingly enough, if you look at the nine month it has gone up by 6.1%. Our growth in this quarter has been all around. The non-top 25 grew by 2.9%.", "Attrition came down on a yearly basis. Last year this quarter, it was 17.4%. Right now this quarter, on an interim basis, it is 15.4%. Now, this means that the controller has been coming down.", "Our new specific area of products and platforms is seeing good traction. We have $300 million of PCB signed up and five deals in (inaudible) and this is sort of consumers have been signed up this quarter.", "This is a different business. This is a business where we have been in the top 10. It\u2019s a business where it is long-term, it is sticky, but having $300 million dollars in PCB gives us the confidence that we are in the right direction.", "We have added multiple deals this quarter. Five large deals we have closed and one transmission deal. Two of the large deals are $500 million-plus including rebates, and a couple of them are in Europe, which again shows that our investment in Europe is starting to pay dividends.", "Our strategic direction Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise is seeing traction with our clients. Now, with all this here continue to operate in a very uncertain environment. There is overall uncertainty. There is Europe in crisis, crisis in key markets. There is currency volatility. There is an election area in U.S. So, there is volatility all around and we have to remain cautious. But these activities are in line. We assume that it finalized in the next four weeks.", "With that, let me hand over to Bala to give more color on the financial numbers.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good afternoon, everybody. This quarter has been a challenging \u2013", "Operator", "Excuse me, this is the operator. Sir, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. There seems to be some disturbance.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Okay. Is it okay now?", "Operator", "Yes. Please go ahead.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Okay. This has been a challenging quarter. In the beginning of the quarter we said revenues could grow somewhere between 3.4% and 5%. But in the events of the quarter, the environment has become much more challenging", "Our expect early indicates on the budget is that it will be flat to marginally down. Discretionary spend is likely to come under pressure in the near term. We are doing a guidance, a last guidance considering the environment in which we operate.", "We have seen the clients becoming more cautious. So even though they had a budget, they have not spent on the budget because they try to conserve cash in the volatile economic environment. So in the middle of the quarter, we came and updated the market saying that it could be somewhere closer to the lower end of the range what we guided for. And that is what we ended for the quarter.", "In rupee terms, our growth sequentially has been close to 15%. The rupee that this should be around 11% this quarter. At the net income level, the growth has been 24%.", "Our operating margin went up by around 3%, mainly due to rupee. The rupee average was 51.37 this quarter as against 46.30, that means 11% depreciation, which could improve the margin there on 4.4%. But since we have incremental costs coming in at around 1.4%, the net increase in operating margin was around 3%. The non-operating income has been good. We get a yield of close to around 9.7% on our portfolio. Today, we are close to 20,000 crores of cash in the balance sheet and the effective tax rate is around 28.6% this quarter. We always said it could be somewhere in the range of 28%, 28.5%, and that is where it is. Today we get around 13% of our revenues, let me say there.", "So going forward, the debt is a business fix up, quite possibly the effect of tax rate could come down. So net-net, we had exceeded the higher end of the rupee guidance for the quarter, thanks to the position of rupee. But in dollar terms, we are closer to the lower end of the range.", "For next quarter, looking at what has happened in the third quarter, we are very cautious in our approach. We believe that generally the third and fourth quarter are tough quarters for us. And even the \u2013 it will reflect even this year and so we have given that slight revenue guidance for next quarter. But having said that, we assume that pricing will continue. That\u2019s what is going the December quarter even in the March quarter.", "So take the last nine months on a year-on-year basis, our pricing went up by around 6%. So what this means is we have focused on high-quality growth that is helping us. We have a perfect platform. Today our utilization is around 36%. We added 49 new clients during the quarter.", "So look at the last nine months, we added close to 120 clients. This compared 140 for the whole of last year. Actually, we are adding more clients. Our growth from non-top 25 clients was close to 4.9% this quarter. So they are coming up, they are moving up on the run rate. That\u2019s a good news for us.", "And the quality of growth is extremely good with the pricing what we saw in the last nine months. Attrition rate has come down. It was close to 17.4% in the beginning of the year. That has come down to around 15.4% now.", "The focus on platform solution business is very high. We have a TCV of close to $300 million of business in that area. Even though it\u2019s small, that is a big focus area for us to achieve a positive growth strategy and we signed five large deals; two of it is more than $500 million deal.", "So if you look at the kind of operational metrics and the kind of platform we have, it is positioned for the growth for next year but we have to wait for the budget to get finalized. Hopefully, the budget will be turn on time this year and will allow greater visibility near term. But the initial indication is budget could be flat or slightly down. What is important for us is the offshore confidence is in the budget more than the budget per se. So I think with all the challenges in the global economic environment, clients\u2019 focus on efficiency is going to be high and that could increase offshoring. Europe could grow faster than U.S. because the level of opportunity in Europe is still much lower than U.S. So the uncertainty increases probably that could accelerate the offshoring.", "So net-net next year, the budget looks more or less flat or slightly down and get a better view on the beginning of the year. But for the Q4, we had given the guidance based on uncertainty regarding Q3 and we had assume the currency at 52 for next quarter. We believe that currency could be under pressure for some time. So around the margin trend, we are comfortable, we have to see how the next year pans out looking out at global environment.", "With this, I conclude, now we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We have the first question from the line of Vihang Naik from MF Global. Please go ahead.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Hi, good afternoon, sir. I just wanted to know about the geographical revenue growth that you\u2019ve seen. I mean, more than 80% of your incremental revenues have come from Europe, so, I mean, what is it that is happening in Europe, and why is not the U.S. not really picking up in the same way?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, I wouldn\u2019t consider that as a secular trend, but at the same time it reflects the investments we are doing in Europe. We have set up offices in Germany and France. The large deals that we have won, I think of couple of them are in Europe, and one of the larger than $500 million deal is also in Europe. So it\u2019s a reflection of these things. Also, always remember that even though there is a lot of volatility in Europe, offshoring in Europe is much lower, and our client that isn\u2019t in Europe has been much stronger lately. So it reflects all of those things, but I wouldn\u2019t consider that as a secular trend unless we see it for a few more quarters.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Okay, and secondly, I mean, your top line has declined in dollar terms by 1.8% here. I mean, are there any project rundowns here, or is it like an orderly acquisition?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, there is no secular trend here. This year, the growth this quarter, the growth has been driven by the non-top 25. We have seen this in quarter after quarter. Every quarter we have seen this, either it will be top 10, top 25, non-top 10, non-top 10. So if you look at the last eight quarters, you will see that the growth is really widespread. It is secular across between segments of the client. So I wouldn\u2019t leave anything into it.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Okay. And lastly, your pricing in constant currency has gone up by about 0.8% toward, has been like-to-like billing rate increases or is there a mix change to it?", "S.D. Shibulal", "They\u2019re both few occasions they have pricing increase and most of the duration that has been stable. They have not been price cuts and there has been portfolio improvement. Also slight amount of non-linearity, I wouldn\u2019t say this much but very small amount of non-linearity yet in \u2013 because of the products in that homework. So if the competence about the \u2013 but the most important thing over the last nine months of pricing has gone up by 6.1% and last one year, 5%.", "That is a reflection of our focus. It is very important, remember, it\u2019s that reflections of our aspiration and our focus. We have always focused on high quality of goods and it is a reflection of our focus on high quality growth, very, very high business value and giving specific partnership, increasing the leverage. These are all foundations for high quality growth, and what you\u2019ll see is the reflection of that.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Okay. Thank you, sir. That\u2019s it for me.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "Thanks for taking my questions and congratulation on a strong quarter. My first question is on \u2013 if you could just elaborate on the weakness that we saw in the middle of the last quarter where several ramp ups were getting delayed because of the macroeconomic weakness. Was that more specific to certain verticals or certain price?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No. Actually it is, I will revise that but it was \u2013 there was no particular trend in any other specific verticals. We have seen weakness \u2013 we have seen the velocity of the business decisions marginally coming down. We have seen delays in decision-making. We have also seen \u2013 we are seeing delays in ramp ups. That means the programs have just started with an expected design but not ramping up because of signs of lack of confidence. We are not seeing cancellations. We\u2019re not seeing cancellations. So in the middle of the quarter, after the guidance last quarter, we haven\u2019t seen it most recently. That led us to a stage in the middle of the quarter that will be prudent to the lower end. And that is where we ended up.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "And this is just last question on pricing. Again, you mentioned you will be able to get some pricing benefits over the course of last year but expecting the last one quarter after the repeat depreciations, some of your competitors are indicating they might be passing on benefits of depreciation through bearing rate cuts. Have you seen that happened on a competitive basis or that might impact you going forward?", "S.D. Shibulal", "The pricing on what?", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "[inaudible]", "S.D. Shibulal", "The currency. The pricing is \u2013 that is a completely wrong thing to do because you will not be able to negotiate prices when the currency appreciates, right? And so it\u2019s not viable option for us, it\u2019s not the right thing to do because the pricing is independent of the currency, otherwise you have to be able to go back and to monitor if the currency appreciates, either go back and renegotiate all your prices. That is not viable option. However, I must say that line for two to three years and we also get hit by constant currency movement.", "So, for example, this quarter, our constant currency revenue is to-date we go average, the revenue is 1,823, which is 4.4% growth, where as we reported 1806. So there is implication of rupee depreciation, at the same time there is the cross currency movements. So I think it\u2019s the appropriate thing to do.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "Appreciate that point. So I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any evidence of that in the marketplace?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No. we are not seeing it. We are not seeing evidence of that.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "Okay. Thanks a lot [inaudible] best of luck for the remaining quarters.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair and Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call. I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand the guidance. If pricing is going up and demand is relatively stable and you\u2019re not seeing cancellations, I\u2019m a little surprised that Q4 is flat. If you could just provide a little more color, that\u2019d be helpful.", "S.D. Shibulal", "So if you take the revenue and do some analysis, 30% of our revenue comes from consulting and system integration work, which is becoming a discretionary spend. In uncertain times, the discretionary spend is scrutinized at a much higher level, that\u2019s number one.", "Number two, the consulting and system integration work which we do is not annuity based. The average program size would be to anywhere between nine to 18 months. So it means that every quarter, we will have to replenish the work which we do. That will require velocity in decision making to replenish. So these are all factors which will impact our guidance and our growth.", "At this time here today, there is serious uncertainty in the markets. Budgets are getting closed flat to marginally down. We are not sure about the velocity at which they will take decision to spend the money.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Just to step back though, you had a whole bunch of transformational deals closed this quarter or last quarter. I\u2019d suspect those flow into special integration consulting. So I\u2019m sort of a little surprised that you aren\u2019t seeing that offset a little bit by all the transformational work, these large $500 million deal that Bala talked about, helped that out?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Actually, the last \u2013 so, if you look at the deal closure, it also reflects what I\u2019m talking about. Now as I mentioned, the work closed this quarter is only one. We have closed large deals this quarter. These deals are mostly in the \u2013 actually, all in the operational space. They are multi-year deals. They are large but they are multi-year deals. In this quarter we have only closed one transformational deal. One large transformational deal.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, and then if we go back to last quarter when you talked about budgets, you\u2019ve said marginally flat to marginally up, and now you say flat to marginally down, can you give us a sense of what the tone is and the change and why that is so dramatic in three months?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, the budget, the things we have and the margins have deteriorated after the beginning of the last quarter, that was reflected in the middle of the quarter when we actually started seeing about the fact that we will be closer to the lower end. You know, when we give a guidance, it\u2019s a statement of fact and we expect to be somewhere in between, right? And by the time they came to the middle of the quarter, we could sense the margin differential in the environment as the budget is being most. And the fact that there is a process going in the decision-making.", "That led us to a stage in the middle of the quarter that we will be closer to the lower end. Right now, we are at the end of the quarter. We have seen that we are at the end of the quarter; we are in (inaudible). We have seen a number of budgets have been closed. And what we are seeing is mostly flat or marginally down.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "One final one from me, as you look at the number in your revenue, you sort of been \u2013 Infosys has been driving growth in that. What is that today, the total percentage of revenue in constant currency?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Actually, this is normally revenue has one simple basis. Now, with every license this term. So the easiest revenue this quarter is 5.1% of the total revenue.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Right.", "S.D. Shibulal", "That includes connection. Now this then connects to lower revenues and products are naturally quite small. This is quite small actually, to be honest, $30 million or $40 million. Now the important thing is what is the future. This is a different kind of business, this is a business in which you will actually book annuity revenue in large amount and it will flow through in a period of time.", "So we have closed $300 million of TCV, which will grow into the system over the next four or five years. So it\u2019s a CapEx model. It is an investment from our side which we\u2019ll get return over a period of time. It\u2019s a high TCV model, monthly, year contract. It\u2019s a model annuity-based. So we have $300 million of TCV closed in the product investments stake, other than (inaudible).", "There is other part of the non-linear revenue which is the revenue in places like Infosys management or in maintenance or in BPO, where we price it differently. Not based on effort, based on either tickets or transaction or device or incident. That actually we are not including in this 5.1%, that was about, it would be about 3% to 4%.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, thanks, that\u2019s it for me, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anup Upadhyay from SBI Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.", "Anup Upadhyay \u2013 SBI Mutual Fund", "My question has been answered. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Mehta \u2013 Nomura", "Hi there, I just wanted to know what explains the flat growth in U.S. and narrowed up to, and are you seeing the same impact in terms of the deal-making dealers and the \u2013 as well? And secondly, in terms of our flat growth guidance for the next quarter is the assumption that across geographies you\u2019ll see flattish growth, although in some geographies, that could actually show some declines as well.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Yes, hi, this is Ashok. We have in the U.S. market respective highs, as Shibu said earlier, I don\u2019t think there is too much to be read into the fact that it\u2019s down by a percentage. I think we\u2019ve grown the investment that we have made in emerging markets, are already beginning to yield dividends, as well as Australia where they have a significantly large pipeline with a very high quality of conversion in financial services, whether they\u2019d be spent up in Australia, in \u2013 in China which has allowed us to open up Japanese banks space that are close to us. Mexico, we are ramping up. ", "We are already at 600 people; we are setting up another center. Brazil is too early, so I think from a U.S. goal perspective compared to Europe, I think it\u2019s not a secular trend that too much can be looked into. When we are evaluating our \u2013 what we would be able to achieve next year definitely look at the aspects of the various product lines, various business lines that we operate in various industries and definitely we also look at the geographies or where the biggest opportunities are coming.", "And in fact off the strategies that we have in Infosys 3.0, we expect to see significant traction in the products and platforms space not only in the U.S. market but also in our emerging market and similarly there are consulting and system integration practices that ramps up the opportunities that are opening up for us in a non-traditional market if you will are also fairly high.", "Ashwin Mehta \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Just another question in terms of the decision making details that you witnessed from November onwards and the details in terms of ramp ups. In the beginning of this quarter until now, have you see any improvements there or there has been some more deteriorations since then?", "S.D. Shibulal", "If you mix, it would be marginally down. Totally marginally down.", "Ashwin Mehta \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You\u2019d already mentioned that there were five large deals when two of them being 500 million of TCV. If you could just give us some color in terms of which service lines you value, you did mention there from business operations but specifically which areas business operations and the rebate as well? The rebate deal as well specifically which service line that would be?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes. This quarter we have seen quite a good growth in the business operations area as plans continue to spend on optimizing their business operations and the infrastructure management came out against the reserves and also on the integrated resourcing with combined \u2013 instruction came out and then testing on that, whether that increased and traction that we have seen.", "A lot of consolidation of \u2013 for the provision write-offs and the outsourcing for that deal \u2013 for a business on the route of the population increase.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure and \u2013", "V. Balakrishnan", "Once again, I certainly have \u2013", "S.D. Shibulal", "Just to add to what Bala has said, one large deal is in financial services and the second large deal is in the manufacturing sector. Both of them are in Europe. One is predominantly business optimization through integrated delivery and the other is a combination of that and consulting and system integration.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Just two more questions about that, in percentage terms that we had only what was that, Europe is a difficult market to correct in terms of rebuilds because you have people whom you are not able to easily lay off and then basically pay them six to nine months of salary. So that\u2019s basically degrade on margins. Are these used any different from \u2013?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Yeah. As you can see, the lesser rebuild, what I meant was that part of the work which we are already doing is improving the base level of (inaudible). And your rebuild happens in some locations, for example. We have solved situations and we have solved. And then basically what we do is we consolidate the work that what we have, we look at all the future work and everything is sold to us twice. That could happen. There are other situations there that the clients would look at a rebuild plans with \u2013 over there, consolidating partners. So both happens. When I say all people, that wasn\u2019t what I meant.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure. And as these been one and has been dependent this quarterly (inaudible)?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Out of the five there, will be one place that in under consolidation and two of them on new logos. These in out of the five, two are new logos, which means that to a new client with whom we are not first before, but we are going in a very large lean approach.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure. And just lastly in terms of ramp up, you mentioned that there will be based in ramp ups from new projects, are the ramp up sitting for these new deals any different?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, I wasn\u2019t definitely expecting we have to go down, slight. These deals and I am hoping that will scheduled.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandip Agarwal from Antique Stock Broking. Please go ahead.", "Sandip Agarwal \u2013 Antique Stock Broking", "Thanks and congrats on this current quarter. Two queries, one was on the utilization level on those you have mentioned that you are untouchable between the 76%, 30% range, but what is the probability of looking that we will be able to hit the 80% range for us first of all? And second question was more on the application deadline, we are not able to witness as far level to macro expertise but half percent. So if you can throw some light on this, it will be very good.", "S Shibulal", "So on the utilization trend, we are building capacity for the future. Our product lines \u2013 18 months. So because the 70% of it \u2013 is from the campus, and that means that you have to be (inaudible). You are taking an offer is 20,000 next year now. So, and also there is a seasonality split. There is a seasonal split, all of the trainees will come out of training. Because they will join myself year ago to the training of this month, they will all start coming out. And so there\u2019ll be a good amount of people we\u2019re getting in this newer system and that will reflect in the utilization.", "We acquired competence between 76% and 80% because it uses the ability to react in a volatile situation. So in this situation, everything we take that at part, when the client makes a decision, it has to happen tomorrow morning. So we need to have the capacity that we had and that\u2019s very, very important.", "Now, regarding that issue as efficient over \u2013 if you look at quarter to quarter from last year to this year, if you look at the acquisition for last year in Q3, it\u2019s at 17.5%, it\u2019s at 17.49%, and this quarter it is 15.4%. So it has come down by 2.1% on a year-on-year like-to-like basis in the quarter.", "Sandip Agarwal \u2013 Antique Stock Broking", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from Standard Chartered. Please go ahead.", "Pankaj Kapoor \u2013 Standard Chartered", "Yes, hi it\u2019s \u2013 just based on what you are seeing in terms of the buying pattern, do you expect going forward the cautionary spend that you are referring to that could have a higher impact on the volume through or do you see that just putting a higher pressure on the pricing?", "S.D. Shibulal", "See, at this point, we\u2019ve believe that the pricing is stable. It is also important to remember that while unemployment in the year-to-date \u2013 in the online that in overall reported in the industry in which we operate at the end of \u2013 what? It is 3.5%. So it is important to keep this in mind because the unemployment in actually is about 3.5 percentage, very low. So the \u2013 that the pricing to remain stable unless there is some totally catastrophic event. And our focus is to create better and better business value for our clients and that will allow us to always have the size in premium which we incurred in the past going forward.", "Pankaj Kapoor \u2013 Standard Chartered", "And just in terms of the pricing discipline among the vendors, are you seeing any more detail in terms of some vendor pushing down the pricing just to secure volume on such case is going up?", "S.D. Shibulal", "We are very disciplined and it\u2019s not taking different grade to some people are focused on volume; some people are focused on maybe being the largest. And see, our focus already has been to create quality developed. And it is a reflection of our strategies and it\u2019s the reflection of our idea delivering to our clients. It is not a reflection of rate. It is a reflection of what we are actually \u2013 the strategies we are reflecting, adapting and the business in which we deliver to our clients.", "So we do see occasional aberrations and different take, different path, different strategies. In our case, it\u2019s very clear to us that we need to create a high-quality growth. We need to get better and better business value and with more and more capabilities, do more and more compliment programs in consulting and system integration, drive efficiency in operations and drive evaluation through products and platforms. As long as we do that, we believe we should be okay.", "Pankaj Kapoor \u2013 Standard Chartered", "Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS India. Please go ahead.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Hi, a couple of repeating questions. I was just looking at your gross margins this quarter. It\u2019s gone up about 170 basis points. I\u2019m trying to reconcile, I think Bala spoke about the 400-plus basis points positive because it\u2019s currency. Given that pricing seems flattish, utilization seems flattish, volumes have been more or less in line; I\u2019m trying to understand why the gross margin is up only 170 basis points please? Is there any area that you\u2019ve invested in during the quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, there are certain costs like the subcontracted costs during the quarter. And that is the reason you don\u2019t see the full benefit in the gross margin. With the operating margin level, you had seen the impact coming in at around 3% maybe because of currency. So some cost goes up. We do need to make investment. For example, we hired more people than what we budgeted for. We usually have 8,000 people, we hired 9,655. And so all that add to the cost but full benefit of \u2013 will be the \u2013 they will not come to the margin because we have this installation costs in other areas.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Fair enough. And I also noted that your sales and marketing expense in dollar terms seem to have come off almost 10% QoQ. I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s behind that? Is that \u2013 were you making an investment in this area in the last few quarters, and if that\u2019s done and is the current number the level that we should be looking at going forward?", "V. Balakrishnan", "We have more in those certain areas. We have more than 1,000 people in sales and marketing. And we don\u2019t look at the quarterly numbers on all this. If you look at the secular trend, we are still spending enough money on sales and marketing to request for the group. I don\u2019t think we have that or anything.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Fair enough. And this time, with your question on increased hiring vis-\u00e0-vis expectations or expectations of volume growth have much really deteriorated from beginning of last quarter to now and its exactly guiding to either both. So why is then the need to hire incrementally more than what you\u2019ve \u2013 what you were planning to at the beginning of the year?", "S.D. Shibulal", "We are in the [inaudible] expect short-term challenges. We clearly believe that other strategies and also to move very well with the clients as to be aggressive in spending.", "We have very close relationships with our clients and then we are really extremely for them. So we are putting in for the future. We have to be ready when they are ready. And in the long term, where we\u2019ve decided to go check if there\u2019s a trend for it. We are delivering superior business value. We are their partner in term of [inaudible]. We do all those things.", "So in the long term, it\u2019s a very good \u2013 well, good opportunities for it. Even today our pipeline is pretty strong. The only thing is that the deals are not getting close in the speed that which it\u2019s made to be closed. So we need to prepare for the future and these are the investments we need to make.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Sure. And lastly, the 0% growth that you\u2019re targeting for this next quarter, you think it\u2019s a bit of a one-off and there\u2019s a sluggish start maybe because of delays and do you expect the rest of 2012 to pick up because you\u2019ve had clients picking up in the last couple of quarter, is that a fair assumption?", "S.D. Shibulal", "The statement of that as we see it today. Our guidance is always a safe number of facts. And we try to be a fast and we\u2019ve got all the information that we have. When we entered the quarter, we need to see about 95% to 96% of the revenue already booked on February. They were only 50 days. Today is January 10, there are only a few days to raise days left. So this is a statement of fact as you see it, and right now we are doing \u2013 we have talked about the reasons behind our caution on guidance. We are hoping that we will be able to grow. Our aspiration is that we\u2019ll grow the clear quality growth, so we will continue that therefore then. There is no change in our aspirations, and I also don\u2019t believe there is a change in the secular trend.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Good enough. Thanks, and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you, the next question is from the line of Srivathsan Ramachandran from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.", "Srivathsan Ramachandran \u2013 Spark Capital", "Yes, I just wanted to [inaudible] there\u2019s been some steady growth in the business, and we\u2019ve seen another 10 business deals in the quarter. So I was just wondering any specific intakes into what piece of the cynical that\u2019s being sold or accepted broadly at this point of time in the market?", "Haragopal Mangipudi", "This is Haragopal, all around, I think we have good acceptance of new growth in the interim of our traditional offerings like core banking. In this specific quarter, it\u2019s, some of these deals are in Tier 2 and Tier 3 space of core banking, and some in channel space. Channel banking space.", "Srivathsan Ramachandran \u2013 Spark Capital", "Okay, and then I just wanted to understand there, you did mention that there is some softness I the discretionary spend which should have come on board in the beginning of the quarter. So I just wanted to ask, is it one that we have seen some of the initial or the large, implementation deals from \u2013 of multi going some details coming through there.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Actually, what we are seeing is that the roll out with that in progress are actually flourishing well. We are not seeing growth cancellation, we are not seeing previous slowdowns in those thing. What we are seeing is that the new program initiation, the teachings of the new program are being sluggish. So our current programs that actually are going pretty well and what we are seeing in new program initiations being sluggish.", "Srivathsan Ramachandran \u2013 Spark Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from RBS. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Yes, even during the middle of the quarter you said that for the full year also we will be closer to the lower end of the earlier guidance, but if you look at the revised guidance, the lower end of the guidance launched would be in demise downward by close to 0.7% despite you had a nice revenue of 6%, $1 million coming to acquisitions so, what has changed first to your statement during the middle of the quarter?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So to the middle of the quarter, we realized that there is \u2013 the relation in the \u2013 a lot of it have been come down and this is not taking on that. See for us to continue to grow quarter-on-quarter, you have to normally you need to cover the business even close in our transformations made and sometimes with the operations made and then with new business, right. So as we got closer to the middle of the quarter, we realized that given the decreasing velocity of this might be in the lower end of the guidance. We can see borrowers from Q4 at that point in time to look in the guidance. But once we got to the end of Q3, we had the Q3 in our hand and we could seek performance more closely.", "Yes, at any point in time when we ended the quarter, we only had a visibility of 95% in ASP, comparing to the non [inaudible], we see in fact in the middle of 45% of revenue every quarter. By then you reach now, which is today, you\u2019ve reached the guidance and we know what happened in Q3. We had great visibility in Q4, and that is what has led to the new guidance which we are in now.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "And just for \u2013 to the question which (inaudible) asked, despite the utilization is so low, we still like to believe in investing and adding more people despite the visibility in terms of the near-term has been lowered. So why not the strategy of increasing your utilization and going in collaboration in terms of large dealers?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, we are definitely aggressive in terms of deals, we have no doubt, at the same time we are focused on quality, number one. Number two, increase the numbers. I would also that are already given. More to the people who are lining and lining in our campus recruitment which happened eight, nine months back. So, and we really are in a \u2013 we have to honor those offers. It is very, very, very important that we honor the offers because we recruit the best talents in the campus, and if we don\u2019t honor those offers, we could implicate \u2013 long-term implications. We need to protect the long-term interest of the business. We have to make sure that we get the right talent, the best talent that anyone in this country could produce.", "So, the dip in utilization you are seeing is a reflection of the people who are coming out of their training and coming into the workforce. In any case, you\u2019ll see this a bit every year. 10,000 people get released from training into production. In a quarter, you will see a bit in utilization. So you\u2019ll see this year-after-year. This year, it is marginally more significant because of the business situation.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Our [inaudible] business operations is 64%, 65% of our business. What percentage of the business which we define as a commodity business where rising pressure would be at?", "S.D. Shibulal", "See, however, our business operation work and not commoditized. It\u2019s very important to note. There will be parts of that which have been commoditized, right. Our business is not entirely commoditized because if that is true, we will not be able to hold that advertising. There is no way our consulting and system integration work which is 30% of the revenue will offset serious revenue productivity reduction in the business operations space which is 65%.", "So we do not commoditize. We apply \u2013 I mean, we drive efficiency, we drive productivity. We create non-lenient, non-network based pricing models. We create innovation at the introductions of multiple service lines.", "Today, everything is positive result. We are able to do much more alignment. We are able to create much more alignment between the service lines which we have. I am not disagreeing that some part of that was maybe commoditized. In those areas, we are driving but then as you can see by their productivity and non-network based pricing models.", "But in general, if you look at overall our revenue productivity were considering system integration, higher than business operations. But both sides, the revenues productivity is stable or marginally up.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "And generally Jan through March has always been seasonally weaker in terms of (inaudible) as you expect by mid of February the budgets may be finalized. Do you believe by the later part of Jan, Feb, March or probably start of April, May for (inaudible)?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Yes. So we are hoping that that will happen. That it will happens in the normal situation, but the concern is coming from the uncertainty and the lack of confidence. If there is no catastrophe between now and that point, we believe that the corporations will get adapted to the new normal which is a volatile normal and start taking decisions.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay. And just a bookkeeping in the fourth quarter guidance, how much is the revenue being built into from the acquisition of Australian big deal company.", "S.D. Shibulal", "It\u2019s 4 million, very small.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay. Okay. And if I\u2019m not wrong, for the next year you have indicated you have given 25,000 campus offers and you are announcing 20,000. So can you \u2013", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, I don\u2019t think there is any change. Whatever we said is what we give. We did not change anything on the campus office.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay. And what would be the total plan out of which you have already given 20,000 campus on?", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Our campus office for next year is complete. You please remember, our recruitment is 70-70. 70% of the people have to come from freshers, that means they\u2019ve been out of college. Out of that, about 80% or 70% come out of campus, the remaining 20% 30% will come just in time.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Viju George from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Viju George \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. All my questions have been answered.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next questions is from the line of Mitali Ghosh from Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes thanks. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the comment I think Bala made in terms of subcontractor cost having gone up. I just wanted to understand which \u2013 why that has been the case that the utilizations have been reasonable?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So you know, we already have some of the [inaudible] is a problem of cost. Actually if you look at the industry norms, I think it\u2019s way below the industry norms, way, way below the industry norms. We already have the requirements on this field to require in certain \u2013 in two weeks\u2019 of time. We not have or we may not want to recruit because these are skilled request on a short period of time. We will not be able to utilize those skills going forward, so the use of contracting in those situations and also there are certain cases there, we will partner with company.", "So for example, we will [inaudible] where we will \u2013 we\u2019ve taken responsibility for their stock support which we don\u2019t do. We will partner with somebody for that support. That also comes under the contacting costs.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Yes and just in terms of the 140-basis-point investment that\u2019s been made in the quarter from the benefit of depreciation in terms of margin. Are there any other areas of investments that you would like to call out in terms of where that is coming because pricing is sort of flattish, utilization on floors actually sort of flat, and offshoring as well, so just trying to understand what those other areas the cost were beyond subcontracting?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Well, we have increased the employee addition. We are, even though on the consumer basis, the date and marketing process come down, the head count basis rate actually has gone up. We are contacting our global clients and business group and putting more and more people with our larger clients. So these are only investments that we are making.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Sure. And secondly, just wanted to understand the \u2013 if Ashok could provide some color on the Financial Services vertical because I think if we exclude the which has done quite well this quarter, I think the growth in Financial Services will probably be flat to negative excluding insurance. And I think Ashok will give a quite [inaudible] October in terms of the outlook for the market there, just trying to understand the root cause this is something quote is basically have caused something more to be available?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So, Mitali, 3.5% growth in the services business starting on the back of about 8.5% last quarter. Typically a soft quarter for us, especially Financial Services. And the growth that time has been fairly distributed across North America, Europe, and I\u2019m very happy with our performance in the Asia Pacific region, especially as I said earlier, Japan, Australia has been very good. If you look at the large deals, of the five deals that we\u2019ve opened, we have two of them in the Financial Services space. In fact, we are able to leverage the regulatory implications, the regulatory changes that are happening, especially in the installing space. [inaudible] is an area where we\u2019ve had \u2013 our whole spend is much smaller than it is in either banking or capital markets. As a result, the opportunity for growth is much higher and that is reflected in that 7.5% growth that we\u2019ve had in that stage.", "Our perception is notwithstanding something Lehman-like happening or something that happened extremely suddenly, like a Eurozone implosion or just \u2013 in our opinion, probably not as possible, we don\u2019t think there is any reason to be bearish on the financial services market. With the investments that we have made, we have built 12 platforms in the company, five of them are in financial services, those are getting traction. Consulting is getting significant amount of traction.", "So our perception is that financial services sector which is about 36%, 37% of the company today, will continue to be represented at those levels. And as we expand more into Latin America and Asia Pacific region, we will be able to mitigate all the potential risks from some of our large clients, maybe not being able to ramp up as quickly. The other quick thing that I wanted to point out is that the 49 accounts that we have opened this particular quarter, 10 of them are from clinical and a similar number from the services side.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, thanks, and just to clarify, this 3.5%, is only excluding and is this in dollar terms or constant currency? This includes the German side which is 0.5 that you mentioned?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, in dollar terms.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Good. Okay, so basically you\u2019re saying this quarter\u2019s sluggishness is more specific to a few clients and not really to be extrapolated?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Exactly. I think some of that is born out of the fact that the bonded deals in Q2, we want some deals. The pipeline was there, but you know winning a deal, having a \u2013 getting a signup is very different from the point \u2013 from actual start. So just to give an example, we had a client, fairly large client that was across a deal and we thought let\u2019s say, let\u2019s start on the first of November. It actually started on the 15th, the 20th of November.", "So, and as a reason for that is they need a lot of set of signatures. They need to do business, to sign up again and so on and so forth. So we basically last about 15, a good three weeks in a quarter which is significant from a revenue floor perspective. So that happened in a couple of days which is a result behind this poor sluggishness. We have no concerns on the pipeline. We \u2013 our only concern is that there is a deferment and delay thing which has crept in. The deal does happen, the deal does signed off, the deal \u2013 and the deal gets \u2013 it\u2019s often started but not necessarily done because it would happen already or when it should have happened.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Sure, thanks. Lastly for B.G. in terms of Europe, if you could provide some color I terms of what the drivers over there in terms of verticals and the services. First of all, what is sort of concentrated in manufacturing and maybe energy and new opportunities or what is sort of more widespread in anything in terms of services?", "V. Balakrishnan", "See, there\u2019d be addition in last \u2013 we added 4 billion accounts in the last quarter in Europe and these accounts have been spread across several sectors, including manufacturing, retail, CPG and financial services. And the large deal \u2013 deals we have had during the quarter, one is in manufacturing and one is in financial services. So the growth has been propelled by different sectors and it\u2019s a little broad-based. Again, services, being the business are the operations including BPO services and the two opportunities have been in the transformation space. So overall Europe growth has been more board-based and even if you take the specific countries, really in the continent, it will be in UK.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. And this would apply to this cooperative meant. In terms of the third quarter, the actual growth that you\u2019ve seen would also have been pretty spread across verticals?", "V. Balakrishnan", "That\u2019s right. And in the number of insiders spoke about what happened in the quarter. So all the data points I shared with you in terms of broad base growth as it leads specific to the quarter. But if you look at the full year for Europe, we have had been \u2013", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "No, right. I meant \u2013 I meant the revenue that you\u2019ve already seen in the quarter rather than things that you see ramping later.", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, okay. Even the revenue which should ramp up has been those deals which we \u2013 opportunities which we closed in the previous quarter as well as incremental growth with our existing client accounts, and that both has come from three sectors, manufacturing, retail CPG and financial services.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I would now like to hand the floor over to Mr. Avishek Lath and the management for closing comments. Please go ahead.", "Avishek Lath", "Thank you everyone for joining us for the call. Thank you."]}

Bernstein ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Rama Rowe - RR Capital Management  ", "Operator", "At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter results for fiscal 2007 for Infosys Technologies Limited conference call. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Mahindroo, you may begin your conference. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in the U.S. ", "Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and MD, Mr. Nandan Nilekani; COO, President and Joint MD, Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; and CFO, Mr. V Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management.", "We'll start with a brief statement of the performance of the Company for the recently completed quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter ending December 31, 2006 and the year ending March 31, 2007. After which, we'll open up the discussion for Q&A.", "Before I pass it on to Mr. Nilekani, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass on to Mr. Nilekani.", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thanks, Sandeep. I'd like to welcome all of you to this call.  I\u2019d like to give you some highlights.  As you have noticed, the revenue for the quarter improved 13% in dollar comp, and thanks to this strong performance we have been able to revise our guidance for the year.  We have revised it to exceed $3 billion and basically, 40.6% to 41.1% growth. ", "So I think the quarter you are seeing here is really a confirmation of many trends we have been talking about the last several years.  As you know, we have been postulating for some time that what you see here is not really just a business but a fundamentally new business model, a fundamentally deceptive business model; a business model which delivers faster, better, cheaper and more innovative solutions to our customers.  I think that is reflected in the kind of growth that Infosys has been able to demonstrate over the last six years.", "As you are aware, we went public in the NASDAQ first in March of 1999. We had revenues of $121 million and now with the latest guidance for the year ending March of \u201907, we anticipate revenues to grow in excess of $3 billion.  In other words, this company will have grown from $121 million in 1999 to over $3 billion by March of \u201907.", "I think another way of looking at it is that it took us 23 years to do the first billion; it took us 23 months to do the second billion; and in effect, we have gone from $2 billion to $3 billion in one year.  So I think you can see the kind of growth that is happening. I think this clearly demonstrates that it is really a fundamentally new business model we have which is taking away market share from the legacy players in this industry, which is creating a whole new, compelling value proposition, and I believe this is a model that is here to stay.  This model is not just about what we do as a company, but what is the impact and consequences of this model on the existing legacy players? What does it mean for their revenue streams? What does it mean for their prices? What does it mean for their global realignment of the workforce? These are all large, structural challenges that will be faced, and we think that we are eventually driving the agenda in this space and other people essentially are following the agenda that we have laid out.", "I think the other important thing we are increasingly saying is we are increasingly convinced that the world is being buffeted by some major, mega trends. We have identified emerging economies as one mega trend, economies like India and China, which is global GDP and went down to 7% in 1970 is slowing inching back to take a larger and larger part of global GDP, which is very important in tightened markets.  We also think the impact of demographics, with the rise of the young workforce in the Asian countries as opposed to an aging workforce in Europe, which has implications on health care, on dependency ratios, on pension benefits, and the need to get a high return on capital in emerging markets.", "We also see a huge impact of regulation, whether it is financial regulation, health regulations, privacy regulations.  All kinds of regulations which have a huge impact on companies.  ", "Finally, we find a huge impact on technology and businesses in a sense Infosys is a child of technology through change because we are able to have thousands of people trading across the world using one network to deliver value. ", "So clearly, these four mega trends: emerging markets, demographics, regulations and technology, we think is flattening the world and I think it is affecting each and every company, because every company that is in the business of selling to customers is finding that who they sell to is changing, what they sell is changing, how they sell it is changing, where they produce it is changing, where they source it from is changing, where are the employees to provide the value is changing. In other words, everything is really up for grabs, and we think that this transformation is going to affect every industry, whether it is banking or retailing or telecommunications or insurance or what have you.", "We think that Infosys is uniquely placed to be of service in this change, because we ourselves are (a) a creature of these changes; and (b) we ourselves being what we call a flat company, we are in the best position to tell or advise our customers on what they should be doing, because we have gone through these changes ourselves or we have been constructed on the basis of these fundamental changes happening in the global world.", "So we find that this message is resonating extremely well with the customers.  Our customers believe that the world is flattening, our customers believe that they have to go through a transformation. Our customers believe that Infosys is the right partner for this transformation, and this is contributing to a huge impact in terms of mind share, in terms of global awareness of the Infosys brand, in terms of what we can do for them.  I think all of these things which you would think are not really that relevant, actually play a huge role in the strategic positioning of Infosys.  It is that strategic positioning which provides essentially the wind power in the sense that drives this whole thing.", "I think with that context, you will notice that we have had tremendous growth,  and an important facet of this growth is that unlike maybe a couple of years back where growth was due to three or four large customers, what you will find is that this time the growth is coming due to a whole constellation of large customers who span industry, who span geographies. I think this broadening of large customers and creating multiple engines of account growth I think is one of the reasons for the robust growth that you have seen.", "Now there are many, many other aspects to this. I think the other important thing which we have been emphasizing for quite some time is that our growth is fundamentally based on robust, organic growth. I think that we are growing at 40% this year entirely on an organic basis.   The reason again that this is happening is because Infosys focused on building client value, we are focused on building a broad range of capabilities to deal with our clients, we are focused on expanding our relationships, we are focused on delivering value.  These are old-fashioned concepts, but that is how we get growth. I think we have demonstrated that the business model is very important for this growth, an organic model that is customer focused is very important for this growth.", "So I think when we look at the results, at one level we should look at it in terms of quarterly performance; but I think it is equally important to understand how strategically it fits in to the global scheme of things, and how major changes are happening in the industry and how Infosys is leading that charge.", "With that, I'll request my colleague, Kris, to continue with the discussions.", " Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks, Nandan, and good morning/good evening, to all of you. Let me give you some more details. If you look at the geographical distribution of revenues, almost all the major geographies have contributed to this growth. The U.S.A. grew by 12.6% quarter-on-quarter. The U.K. grew by about 14.2%, France 27.4% --these are major countries in Europe. Japan grew by 12.7%, Australia grew by 28.7%. So it is all-round growth from a geographical perspective.", "If we look at Infosys, we had again growth in all the services, some of course better than others like package implementation, consulting, testing, business process management, et cetera grew faster than the Company average. Products also, that has been a colossal growth.", "From an industry perspective, the industry segments which were strong were banking and capital markets, telecom, energy and utilities. So, again, we had all-round growth from an industry perspective.", "Our revenue per employee on a blended basis grew 1.2%, 1.4% onsite and 1.1% offshore. For the past three quarters we have seen that the revenue per employee has been growing. We have seen a 3% to 4% increase in rates for new clients, and about 1% to 2% increase in some of the contract renewals. Now it's starting to get reflected on the revenue productivity. We had 271 million-dollar clients, this quarter 232. We have 61 $10 million clients and 12 $50 million clients and two $100 million clients. The largest client is 6.6% of revenue. So, again, we saw faster growth in our top 10, top 20 clients. ", "From a scalability perspective this quarter, we have added the largest number of employees, 10,795 employees of which 2,560 are experienced hires. Attrition has inched up to 12.9% but we are also much more rigorous in looking at performance and encouraging people to leave. Out of this 12.9% about 2.9% is involuntary attrition, or attrition which is encouraged. Utilization, excluding trainees, for the services business is 80.3%, last quarter was 77.3%. It's partly because of the faster growth experienced this quarter. Including trainees at 68.7%, which represents the huge addition at the entry level, most of those people are undergoing training. We have absorbed salary increases. This quarter we have also announced a long-term bonus for some of the senior people within the Company. ", "During August we were able to maintain the margins. We continue to invest in infrastructure building. 7 million square feet of space is under construction, which will give us capacity for an additional 13,400 employees.", "With this, let me hand it over to Bala to give you more details on the financials.", " V. Balakrishnan ", "Good morning, everybody. This quarter the revenues were $746 million, which is a sequential growth of 13%. Of that, 11.2% is volume growth, 1.2% is price growth. On-site, per capita revenue went up by 1.4%; offshore it went up by 1.1%. On a blended basis, it went up by 1.2%. Gross profit, 43.3%. We had the benefit of lesser visa costs during the quarter. It impacted the margin positively by 1.1%. ", "We also have the currency in our favor. The rupee depreciated by something around 1.4% during the quarter. It impacted the operating margin positively by 90 basis points. Sales and marketing costs were 6.4%. It was 6.8% last quarter. G&A is 8.4%, similar to what it was last quarter. Overall we got a benefit of 50 basis points, and we achieved it because of the scale.", "Non-operating income was less during this quarter because we don\u2019t have the benefit of large exchange gains which was there in the first quarter. Income tax is 3.5%. The effective tax rate is 11.7%, similar to last quarter's. Overall net profit was 26.6% this quarter as compared to 26.4% last quarter. So overall, we had the benefit of visa costs, currency and levered what we saw because of scale, which has improved our operating margin by something around 2.5%.", "Going forward, we've given a guidance of 5.9% to 6.6% growth in revenues for next quarter, revenue being $790 million to $795 million. EPS to be $0.37 for next quarter, which is 3% growth, because we are assuming the currency to appreciate next quarter. Our guidance is based on a rupee/dollar rate of 45.6 for next quarter and for the next full year.", "For the full year we have given a guidance of 40.6% to 41.1% growth in revenues, with an EPS of $1.44, which is 41.2% growth. Our balance sheet today is $2.2 billion. We have around $948 million in cash. Accounts receivable is around 65 days.", "So I think overall it's a good quarter. We have seen a margin improvement. For the full year we are assuming the operating margins to be stable, similar to what it was last year. Last full year the operating margin was 27.8%. We believe it should be similar to that during this year, within a narrow band of 40 to 50 basis points.", "I think with this I'll conclude the financial presentation. Now the floor is open for questions and answers. Thank you.", "Sandeep Mahindroo ", " We are ready for questions. Please go ahead.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", " Yes, thanks, and congratulations on a very, very strong quarter. On the pricing front, what in your view has been contributing for the recent pricing strength, especially on the base of existing clients?", "V. Balakrishnan", "For the past three quarters we have been saying that we are able to get slightly better prices. It's primarily driven from the clients appreciating, understanding that the costs in India are going up and that at some point it will have to get reflected. It is a small increase but it is happening now. In Infosys' case, we are also quite clear that below a certain price we will not take up work. So that is also helping us with new contracts to try and push up our price points.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", "On the attrition rate side, you\u2019ve indicated that if you looked at voluntary turnover, it was probably about 10% for the quarter. For comparison purposes, can you just give us a feel, what was the voluntary turnover  levels during the past two quarters? Was it flat? Was it high? Was it lower?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The voluntary turnover last quarter was approximately 9.2%, and the quarter before that was about  9%. So there are three kinds of issues here. First, our training has increased in the sense that you have to get a certain minimum level of accomplishment to get through training. So there we are seeing people not getting close, so they don\u2019t get in. ", "Two, very importantly, this quarter we had 450 people or so leaving for higher studies, because it's the quarter that it happens. So this quarter it will not happen. ", "Three is, of course, the people at the bottom level of performance who left. These are the three things that drive the largest part of the attrition. In the voluntary part we are not seeing any appreciable increase. There is a marginal increase and that\u2019s caused by the fact that the markets are buoyant. The U.S. markets too are buoyant and that is the main reason.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", "Finally, after we've seen decelerating revenue growth last year, it seems that we're headed towards accelerating growth. Can you comment on this trend?  Is there anything unusual here? Because obviously this is a pretty positive trend for the industry.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. Nandan was saying it shows that this market is better for the clients. They are able to get better quality deliverables at very good price points. So clearly this is a better model, and clearly that's the reason. As companies become larger, clients are more and more comfortable working with us on larger projects. Clients are willing to increase their revenues or increase their services with us. So today we have two $100 million relationships and all the parameters from a customer perspective are growing. We have a very diversified portfolio of services. If you include BPO, the footprint is very large. ", "So it's a combination of all these things, all the things we have been doing in the past five years: starting new services, starting consulting, starting BPO, creating the brand equity, enabling our Company to scale up, creating the capacity to recruit, train. All these things are paying off at this point and the market conditions are right, and so we're able to take advantage of that.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", " Thanks.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Bryan Keane - Prudential.", " Bryan Keane  - Prudential", " Hi, good morning. Just when you look at your guidance for the first quarter and then the second quarter, you obviously have blown through those numbers, especially on the top line. Can you pinpoint what surprised you? Why the out-performance?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Clearly, the environment is conducive. We got the benefit of better market conditions. Our services were appropriate for the market. We executed well, so customers were able to give us more business. The surprise was the volume, and of course we were able to take advantage of that in terms of capturing that business. So volumes were the surprise and we took advantage of that.", " Bryan Keane  - Prudential", " You mentioned in your opening comments about taking some share from legacy players. Has that been a change over the last couple of quarters that you're seeing now, where work used to go to the multinationals, now Infosys is taking some of that work?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", " Yes. We believe that as companies become larger, this will enable our clients to actually work with us on larger relationships and larger projects. That also has been a cycle, at least, that's going on here. If you look at some of the fastest growing services like package implementation, consulting,  the total number of people who are able to deliver consulting type of service is almost 3,000 today. That is helping us, those transformation projects, consulting assignments, end-to-end solutions, BPO driven, business transformation. So I think it is what is driving the replacement which is happening from the legacy players to companies which are more global delivery-oriented.", " Bryan Keane  - Prudential", "Finally, on the metrics, I just noticed that repeat business was down to 95%; that number's usually 97% or so. Did some clients move away? What explains that downtick?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", " The way we compute it is it is reset every finance year, so Q1 is higher, Q2 is lower. At the end of the fiscal year it will come down to 90%. On an average it's 90%. It gives us better visibility into the pipeline. It allows us to build a deeper relationship with our clients, increases the predictability. New customers are also ramping up faster at this point.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", " Hi, gentlemen, congratulations on some good results here. I just had a couple of quick questions for you. The first one is that it appears here that the offshore movement continues to evolve, with the Indian vendors moving into different geographies, verticals and offerings. Can you comment on any specific areas of growth that you feel you guys are focusing on? Anything new on that front? Obviously the movement towards package implementation is there, but anything new on that front?", "V. Balakrishnan", "From a geography perspective, proactively we are investing in Europe. Europe has gone from 9% of revenues some years back to 25% of our revenues. From a services perspective, it's more business solution driven rather than a technology solution, combining our consulting package implementation, BPO. Today we are able to offer clients transformation projects, transformation solutions.", "We have also come out with our point of view on what the landscape is today from a business perspective and what companies need to do in today's world. Nandan, in his opening remarks, talked about the four major shifts which we see, and we are able to help our clients with how they need to respond, how they need to compete in today's world.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Obviously it looks like demand is pulling the market and putting pressure on the labor supply. Can give us some idea where maybe you expect attrition to be in the future? Also, on the wage front, could you give us a lateral fresher mix for recruits this quarter? I think you gave it in the earlier call.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Attrition for the rest of the year should be in the same range, sitting where we are, seeing what we're doing. Salary increases for the next year should be in the range of 12% to 15%, sitting where we are today. The reason is we don\u2019t see any perceptible shift there. The key challenge you face when you grow out is getting enough middle level people in to meet our growth requirements. Otherwise the base pressure is there but there is no perceptible shift or change. ", "We're also seeing that for the big companies who came into India, who used to raise wages and pay much more than what we pay for people who joined them, they're becoming more cautious and more discriminating. The indiscriminate increase in salaries has come down and they are benchmarking against large Indian companies. So I think there is some stabilization going on there, because people are very conscious that continued pressure on wages is not going to help anybody. ", "So on both fronts I think there is some stability, but it all depends on the growth rate. The growth rate go up, obviously other positions  open up and attrition will be slightly higher. I think that attrition is not a great cause of risk or worry for us at this point of time. We want to bring down the attrition, of course, but it's not something that is giving us very sleepless nights.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", " Just staying with the labor question, as far as middle managers, any rough idea what the attrition rate is at that level? Could you give us a ballpark number of what salaries are at that level?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, middle level is something from three to seven years of experience. Attrition at the middle management level is around 12.5% if you take the entire basket of people. The wages at the middle management level, I would estimate is something around $20,000 to $25,000.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Per year, per year; not month.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Per year, of course. One last question on the BPO front, any growth drivers in that business? If you could just give me the attrition rate this quarter that would be great.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, the growth drivers in the BPO business is the [Effendi] business, [Effendi] is growing; more customers are coming in, we have about 1,500 engaged in [Effendi] and we got a lot more enquiries in that particular area. In the knowledge processing area, the research area is opening up and is seeing much more enquiries. But these are two large areas which are growing pretty fast, along with the rest of the business.", "The attrition in the BPO business is about 28% for the quarter. And it's come down about 2%, and if you consider 25% of attrition is in the zero to three month category. That is very strange in this industry, because when people join they have to go to night shift, some of them don't adjust and some of them leave. About 40% attrition is in the one year to one-and-a-half year's category. Because the one-year people get trained, and the demand for them is much greater than the people below one year. These are the two categories. In the category one-and-a-half years plus, the attrition comes down. ", "So there are two lumps that happen in the attrition and that's for a very particular reason. But we are trying to push it down. I think in the future, attrition rate in BPO will come down.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research.", "Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research", " Thank you. And, again, congratulations on a phenomenal execution. First question is for Bala. You did mention that the visa costs have gone down. I believe that the H1 visa cap had been reached, I think in the month of April. Is that one of the reasons, or is there something else you are seeing there?", "V. Balakrishnan", " No you are right, because we actually reached the visa  investment in the first quarter, because we knew that window was going to get closed. We spent close to $11.5 million in the first quarter. The impact is not there in the second quarter. That is one of the reasons why the margin went up.", "Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research", "Beautiful. Now, other question I had is the consulting team that is led by Steve Black that seems to be doing very well. I was wondering, when will you feel comfortable telling us how many customers did they engage in? And among these various customers, we have in $1 million, $5 million, $10 million, or $100 million segments, among them, where do you see Infosys Consulting having the maximum traction?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Infosys Consulting will have the best value right now for the large transformation projects. It is helping clients resolve what they need to do to compete in today's world and what they need to do in order to transform themselves to compete in this flat world. So we are doing client workshops regarding what it means, what are the drivers. We do assessment, and come up with a program for them to look at the transformation itself. ", "Most of the work, of course, involved changing the technology platform; again, because of the large enterprise solutions we have in many cases, the transformation is led by the implementing a [inaudible] something like that. Again, we are able to help our clients make this transformation.", "So today the focus is really in how clients transform themselves to compete in this world. We have frameworks, we have methodologies, we have toolsets to help our clients do this.", "Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research", " The last question is on insurance, banking and financial vertical. It seems like all the companies I follow, including the software vendors, they seem to be doing very, very well in this vertical. I was wondering is there something really endemic to this vertical, which is giving a lot of business to almost the whole software industry? Thank you again and congratulations on a phenomenal execution.", "Nandan Nilekani", " This industry always, especially the banking and capital markets, not so much the insurance side, has been a high spender. They love technology. It's driven by innovation and use of the latest technology and things like that. As a percentage of revenue, typically these companies spend higher than other sectors, for example, manufacturing, which typically spend 1% to 2% on technology. Whereas a financial services company would typically spend, maybe, close to 5% and sometimes up to 10%. ", "Some services are completely technology driven, actually. So that's the reason why this sector is a very good sector for software companies, IT services companies, hardware companies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", "My first question is regarding Progeon, did you disclose the operating margin at Progeon?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Yes, let me give you the operating margin for Progeon; as per U.S. GAAP, the operating profit is about 20%.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Okay, thank you.", "V. Balakrishnan", " 20% operating profit. Net income is 21.3% because of non-operating income.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Thank you. Next question is with regard to headcount, I believe that your prior fiscal year '07 headcount guidance was 25,000. Did you update that number?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Yes, 28,300. It is gross of attrition. This is a gross number, not a net number. It is gross of attrition.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Yes. Thank you. And then the final question is regarding the ADR issuance. Could you help us walk through the prospective calendar? It sounds like you are going to meet in November to tentatively approve an offering. But can you remind us, based on the prior schedules, how we should think about the mechanics of the offering again? Thank you.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, the Board has just approved the offering. We are working on the timeframe, we have not finalized that.  The Board approved the re-issue of 32 million  shares to a sponsored second year program, which will include their part of certain public offer we are introducing in [Japan]. We can't share anymore details on this offering, because we are constraint by the regulations of SEC.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Very good. Thank you very much.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Alan Hellawell of Lehman Brothers.", "Alan Hellawell - Lehman Brothers", " Hi gentlemen. I was just hoping to get a little more clarity on your U.S. market strategy. I know that you've invested significantly in large account chase teams. Can you talk about any capabilities that you've developed to entertain larger contracts and whether that is going to be a thrust that we'll see in your contract size in the United States?", "Nandan Nilekani", " There are two ways you can have large relationships, one through large contracts, another through a master service agreement under which you execute multiple projects. Our traditional model, which is very different from the legacy players, has been to have a master service agreement under which you execute multiple projects. It gives the client flexibility. It gives them the option to work with a company for the long term, so that you can take advantage of knowledge retention. You can take advantage of best practice sharing and things like that. But still keep the partner on their toes, because there is always the threat that, if you don't deliver the last project well, I can shift, or I can switch. ", "So that is the bulk of our contracts. It is helpful for us, also, because of the long term nature of the master service agreement we get written into the budget, we are part of the budget process. We are now bidding for larger and larger transformation projects, outsourcing projects. You may have read about the ABN Amro deal in Europe, where we got a share of application outsourcing from them and we are seeing more of those opportunities. ", "What is happening is that, these large outsourcing deals are getting split between two or three vendors. In almost all cases we make the short list, and some of them we win. It's not all going to one company, its going to two or three companies.", "Alan Hellawell - Lehman Brothers", " Great. Well thank you very much.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Hey guys, good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the consulting practice real quick. Can you give us a little bit more color on how many folks you have in the consulting practice today, profitability? And if it's not profitable, when you actually expect it to go profitable?", "Nandan Nilekani", "The consulting subsidiary has 220 people. Consulting, as a service, spans multiple units within the company. We have solution consulting in each of the business units. These are the people who look at industry trends, proactively comes up with solutions. We have some [inaudible] built into it, which has some maybe designs, et cetera and are proactively taken to clients and new projects.", "Then there is a whole area of package implementation, where we start with the package selection, business process re-engineering. Helping customers create the template for their business. Help them with sales management, global roll outs and things like that. Today, we have about 2,000 odd people doing this type of work. Traditionally, you would have classified all these as consulting. We have approximately 2,600 people today, doing consulting type of work.", "Now, again, the consulting subsidiary standalone is making a loss today, because we are still investing in that. We hope that in the next two or three quarters it will turn around and start making profit. Consulting, as a service, is very lucrative especially when it drives downstream, it is giving us the required margins to justify us continuing to invest in that. In fact, the transformation type of project requires us to do program management, change management, business processing which are really consulting type of services.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Understood. A lot of the descriptions that you've just given on the consulting business, the lucrative nature of the kind of work that you are having to do there for your clients. When I relate that back to the profile, the folks that you are currently hiring, 77% freshers. I struggle with understanding how the current mix, which is very weighted towards freshers, will allow you to truly move into some of this higher end consulting work given that those folks are probably not going to be the guys you are going to need for consulting engagements.", "So if you are going to be looking at this business, over the long term, why aren't you hiring more MBA types? Or more folks from outside of industry that can help you truly ramp up this business? Just to get a sense for where you want to take this business.", "Nandan Nilekani", "So, just to give you some numbers, we hired 600 MBAs this year. We are recruiting more MBAs as we speak. We have recruited 2,568 experienced folks this quarter, in just one quarter 2,568 experienced folks. We have recruited 600 CPAs in the last 12 months, especially for our BPO business, they are helping our clients with more of the analytics and more of the research kind of work and things like that; consolidation, closing of books and things like that. ", "And then, of course, we are recruiting in the market also. For example, in the U.S. universities we are recruiting 130 people who are undergoing training in India today. So there is a combination of multiple initiatives, where we believe that we are recruiting the right people for us to participate in this large transformation project.", "Now, you also need to realize that these large transformation projects require a few consultants at the front end. They require a strong technical team to do the architecture, the design and things like that. A very large number of people to do the programming, testing the development type of work. We have looked at the composition of large transformation projects, and structured the pyramid for the company based on what we see as the requirement.", "Now, we don\u2019t want to be a pure consulting firm. That is not our objective. We want to be a company which can help a client do end to end transformation, which includes an impact probably that is what is unique about Infosys. We will help implement and ramp the business operations, which is required today to be competitive. So, we will help implement and operate. So that's the direction in which we are moving.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Okay that's really good. Related to the transformation engagement work that you are doing, what percentage of that work can actually be done first? If you take a standalone transformation engagement, how much of that can you actually do? So, if you break that up between on site and off shore.", "Nandan Nilekani", " So, again, we have to take examples and illustrate this, when we start to package implementation 80% of the product was being delivered on site. Today, only 35% of their product delivered on site. So we have been able to change the outsourcing methodology to move a significant amount of work offshore.", "Even in consulting, which is considered primarily an onsite type of service, over time we are trying to do now second or third documentation preparation, analytics again from offshore. In some cases we are able to deliver 20% of the effort from offshore. ", "So, overall, our hope is that the entire lifecycle, if you look at, it will be 30% onsite, 70% offshore on a blended basis, and that's what we are driving towards.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Okay great. And maybe one quick question on the sales and marketing percentage of expenses, we are down to a level now, I think you said roughly 6.4%, is what I am beginning to model now, on a U.S. GAAP basis. How much more scale of benefits should we expect to see in sales and marketing as we go forward? So, as a percentage of revenue, what's the band that you think this number will bounce around at? ", "Also related to that, what was the depreciation impact in the quarter? How much did depreciation benefit the expense items? Thanks.", "V. Balakrishnan", " I think we will not get major benefit on the sales and marketing side. Most of the leverage may come on the G&A side. Last quarter the sales and marketing costs went up by 1% because we hired more people. This quarter it got normalized, we got some 30 basis points of benefit there. Overall, I think, on the G&A side we can get another 40 or 50 basis points here and there. Coming to the depreciation which is similar to last quarter, we have not seen any incremental benefit or impact because of depreciation.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Hi there guys, nice growth, particularly since it appears you haven't been as aggressive in winning large single contracts as some of your Indian competitors. So my initial question is, is it accurate that you haven't been as aggressive in winning large single contracts? And if so, are you able to hit your growth targets going forward, with below average reliance on these really large deals that are out there?", "Nandan Nilekani", " So, in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year, we have not considered any large deals to be won. Our philosophy, at this point, is that in a market which is buoyant, we don't want to lock up our resources on deals which don't give us the required margins. So we are reluctant to compete on price on these large deals, and lock up our resources.", "So, we look at where the client is willing to structure the deal the way we would like it to be structured. We still believe that we are very competitive and we deliver good value to our clients, better than our competition. But the deal has to be structured such that it would make sense for both of us, for the client as well as for us to take up. That's the philosophy of the Company. So, we are not that aggressive, you are right. We have certain parameters by which we will evaluate each deal, and go forward.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Great, that sounds good. Now, a couple of questions on the margin side. In terms of margins going forward, are you expecting operating margins to decline sequentially in the December quarter and then follow that by an increase in operating margin in the March quarter? Is that the outlook?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Last year, the full year, we had an operating margin of something around 27.8%. In the first half of this year our operating margin is closer to around 27.2%. We believe that it will be stable at around 27%, 27.5% in the next two quarters. On a year-on-year basis, the operating margin will be stable except for the narrow band of some 40 to 50 basis points here and there.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, but are you expecting more strength in the March quarter on margins than in the December quarter? Or is it going to be pretty balances?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Well, it's going to be pretty balanced, because in this current quarter the operating margin is 28.3%, which includes 19 basis points impact because of currency. Going forward we are assuming the currency to strengthen by around 1.4%. So it should be within a band of 27% to 27.5%.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, great. Are you planning mid-year wage hikes this year? We watch the turnover rate move up and some of the supply challenges in the market. Is it possible that you will employ some mid-year wage hikes, beyond the wage hikes given in the June quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Well, sitting where we are sitting, and seeing what we are seeing, we don't believe that we will be increasing wages mid-term this year.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, and when you talk about wages, are you talking about bonus and other related compensation on the stock front; are you broadly defining wages?", "V. Balakrishnan", " No, I think the long term bonus is different in that it is more of a retention plan. The impact of this is not material. Wage hikes come only once a year in April. We don't believe that we will be increasing that mid-year. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, so you may give some additional compensation but they will not be in the wage category?", "V. Balakrishnan", " You see, our variable compensation depends upon the profitability and the revenues, and that is variable. But the base level of salaries will not be increase. Variable in the percentage of the base, and the variables may increase if they do much better, and come down if they don't do well, but the base won't go up.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, great.", " Mohandas Pai", " What we did in this quarter, second quarter, is for one particular sector, we gave an interim hike. The reason is that, we wanted to do that in the first quarter, we could not do it because the fact that, at the beginning of the quarter we felt there was not enough money. So since, we saw things go much better. It was an unfulfilled agenda of the compensation structure in this quarter, but its not going to happen in the next two quarters.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, is that Mohan?", " Mohandas Pai", " Yes.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay. Good to hear from you Mohan. Thanks for the explanation on that. And there is just one quick follow up on the pricing front. Can you define whether price on like for like deals is going up? Or is the increase in price that you are experiencing more due to business mix shift than pricing on like for like deals?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Both. We are playing around with the business mix so that we can optimize our margins and do the right thing. We are also seeing an increase of 3% to 4% on new client deals and about 1 to 2% in some cases, where we are able to renegotiate, so both are applicable. Those are two levers we have. We also have the onsite, offshore mix lever where when the growth rate accelerates we have more project starts,  which is what happened in the last two quarters where onsite went up.  But then proactively we bring down onsite, and that also helps us improve margin.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from George Price - Stifel Nicolaus.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Again, congratulations on very strong numbers. First question is, I wanted to ask about the top account growth, where we've seen the year-over-year growth in your top accounts really seem to accelerate materially.  I am wondering if there is any particular trend that we can take away from that?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Clearly we have worked very hard in creating a basket of services which are relevant. We've made sure that we service the client, made sure that the satisfaction is very high. The size also helps, because as offshore becomes very strategic the client would like to work with larger partners, again size helps in that regard. So it\u2019s a combination of having the right services, executing very well, making sure that the clients are happy and satisfied, and taking advantage of the opportunities.", "The trend we see is that companies are looking at increasing offshore, they are very confident; it has become mainstream. They are confident about the quality of the services and things like that.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Is there any change to the trend? Certainly at one point it seemed like there was a trend towards companies to embrace offshore on a broader basis. They look to possibly add to their list of strategic offshore vendors, to diversify their incremental business. Is there any change, do you see, to that trend? Or is it just the sheer volume of business moving offshore is offsetting that?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Some of the companies are choosing two or three strategic partners; that trend continues. Some of the companies are looking at setting up their own unit; that trend also continues. But as it becomes mainstream this will reflect what is there in, let's say, U.S. or Europe, where companies will do some work in-house, they will have some work outsourced. In outsourcing they will look at two, three strategic partners to work with. Very rarely will a company look at giving their entire IT, hardware, software, infrastructure people, applications, everything to one vendor; but few, very few cases.", "Today, the trend is towards two, three strategic partners, maybe sometimes a captive, a significant drive towards offshore. Even visibility from the Board on what is India's strategy, and especially combining IT and operations from the same vendor offshore. So all these we have anticipated and we have tried to create the relevant services, the relevant client relationship structure to manage this.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Okay. Just a couple of other questions, one on utilization, excluding trainees obviously up significantly quarter over quarter, the highest level we've seen in some time.  I think since back some time in fiscal '05. Obviously it looks like there was strong, pretty strong demand in the quarter, even surprising you. Is that just simply the answer on that strong utilization? Or was there anything else driving it? ", "In terms of expectations going forward, do you think that that level of utilization you are running hot is that going to come down or is it sustainable?", "Nandan Nilekani", " The way we manage this is we shoot for about 77% excluding trainees. This gives us the slack required if the demand is better than we expected, as it was in this quarter, the utilization can go up to 80%. We try to keep it between 77% and 80%; beyond 80% customer service is suffering. So this quarter, the utilization went up to 80.3%. This is actually part of our plan and strategy.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Okay. Last question on the comment that you made on being able to be selective, on deals based on your targeted pricing and margins, and being able to do that given the strong demand. For the work that you don't take on because it doesn't meet your criteria, can you give us a sense of who is then coming into take on that work? Would it be tier 2 firms who are being a little bit more aggressive on price? Any color on that would be great. Thank you.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well it's typically tier 1, it is a small set of companies today who are getting a higher share of the demand which is out there. It is seen from the first quarter results, second quarter results; so we have to wait and see what happens from the other companies. But if we look at the results of the other companies in the first quarter, the larger companies have grown faster than the mid-sized and the smaller companies. So typically it is the larger, the tier 1 companies who are benefiting from this.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Thank you very much.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Rama Rowe of RR Capital Management", "Rama Rowe - RR Capital Management", " Good morning, guys. It's very impressive growth, you guys have almost defied gravity; the law of large numbers says that when you grow, when you become bigger you slow down, but you guys keep on going. How do you see that you will be able to maintain the growth rate that you have at this time? Or that a point will come when you begin to hit the ceiling?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, I think that's a good question, and that also we ought to think about that question often. I don't think we have a clear answer, because clearly there is a lot of scalability in the model. The market for the rebalancing of the global workforce in IT services is still not matured yet. There is huge customer demand. So, I think it's difficult to say when this whole thing will reach an equilibrium stage. I wouldn't like to venture a guess.", "The fact is that we have been able to demonstrate scalability in services, and we have been able to ramp up our people from a few hundred to 60,000. In this business there are companies who have a much larger base in employee count. So, I think, all these things are open questions. But we are trying to build as scaleable an engine as possible.  I think our investment in recruitment, in training, in systems and processes, have all contributed to the scalability. ", "I think we need to come to the end of this. I'd like to thank everyone for participating, for a very enthusiastic and very interesting set of questions.", "Please feel free to email us and ask us more questions about the business performance, the direction. Let me once again state that we believe that we are at a whole new point in this business. Our model is increasingly the sustainable model and it's having a huge impact on global players. ", "I would urge you to study this industry not just as what is happening in India, but what are the global impact  and the consequences thereof. Thank you very much.", "Operator", " Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the second quarter results for fiscal 2007, for Infosys Technologies Ltd Conference Call.

Ladies and gentlemen, we can now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I wanted ask about margin's first. I think why the revision lower, and I think there been a couple of revisions lower over the last couple of years. Do you feel like it's taking them down far enough?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga here. I think if you look at last year, we gave guided 23 to 25, we ended up at 24.3 higher than the midpoint. I think one of the -- I want to emphasize that we'll continue our relentless focus on all the parameters that I talked about as well as the productivity and the cost optimizations.", "What we have done really is, as part of our business review that we did. We looked at areas -- digital areas especially where we need to invest more to leverage the opportunities point one. Second, on the U.S. talent model, we have planned for additional investments so that the growth is not compromised in the United States.", "Third, we've also looked at revitalization of sales to see especially in respect of -- pursuit of large [sales] [ph] and conversation of the [sale] [ph] and also repurposing couple of our talent -- some of our talent in the digital area. While I think what we will do is, as the year progresses there is a range they have given, but as the year progresses, we'll certainly -- we will be able to provide more color on how we are progressing on those four investments. But nevertheless, our relentless focus on the optimization and productivity will continue.", "Joseph Foresi", "So let me ask kind of a different way. Do you feel like you're at your natural long-term level of margins giving next year. And if not what utilization obviously have gone up, so I'm wondering what leverage you have to continue to maintain the margin level that you have.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "I think we are confident of retaining the guidance range to the current 22% before we're confident about it because we also believe that some of these investments are required for leveraging the digital growth in the near term. So we're confident of that range in the medium term.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then, the last one for me, can you give us some color on how fast Brazil grew for you and what your expectations for the growth rate in that business are going forward? Thanks.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. In terms of digital, we started to really track and look at it very carefully for this fiscal '18 process the disclosure for us.", "In Q4, digital has grown 3.6% over Q3, with that sort of a trend, it's something that we would push for. We see the market certainly growing at a large level. Overall, digital number of 2.8 billion we have attracted and look for this carefully in fiscal '18, we start to see comps in fiscal '19 as quotas roll in.", "We also see the overall addressable market for this business is somewhere in the range of 180 billion to 200 billion and that market is growing quite strongly. So we expect this to be -- one of the growth drivers for us in the future.", "Joseph Foresi", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anantha Narayan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thank you and good evening everyone. I have a couple of questions as well and the first one is to Ranga, on the margin issue. So Ranga, the new -- you spoke about those investments being the reason for ratcheting down your margin range. Are there any one-off elements in those investments or should we sort of expect such investments to continue just given your size and growth.", "And if the latter than what sort of top-line growth would be required to get your margins back to the 23% to 25% range.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "This is Ranga here. I think, sorry, you were saying something.", "Anantha Narayan", "Yes. Sorry, just to clarify this question was related to more from a three, four year perspective rather than just for FY'19?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Yes. I was saying earlier we ended the year at 24.3 and a Q4 was robust at 24.7. And the guidance that we have given 22 to 24 finally takes into account, so the investment but one-off big ticket single investment that we need to do. It is not like that it is not really a chunky investment. We're looking at all the prop accounts and also the service lines where we have more potential to grow primarily investing in the capabilities, primary investing in certain IP that were required to drive the digital growth. It's not really a large term investment that they're looking at.", "And of course, this will be very gradual and progressive during the year depending upon how those investments pan out during the year. Certainly will have -- it will have necessary impact on the margin. But at this point in time what they have assumed is really all these investments that we're going to make throughout the year.", "But, of course, we are conscious of the fact that for the overall EPS and earnings growth the margin date has to be more than be compensated by the revenue growth to retain the EPS growth, I think that in the medium term. So I think we are very conscious of that fact. I think this is a balance between how we need to really look at focusing invest in digital areas where we feel that there is a large opportunity that we need to leverage.", "Anantha Narayan", "And on the second part of that question Ranga, over the next three or four years, would single-digit growth suffice for you to manage your margins at the existing levels?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Well, I think one of the factors that I would like to emphasize the market levers that we're looking at here is not necessarily the cost optimization lever alone. One of the things is, the digital revenue that we've talked about 25.5% for the year is coming at higher price points and not only higher price points it is also delivering us better gross margin than the core IT services.", "So, our emphasis or endeavor would be to drive that price point and gross margins in digital better during the year. And that is something that we're also working on. So our overall objective is that a combination of faster growth in digital services, which will be at -- which could be at higher price point and gross margin need to offset the other impact of the margin growth on the EPS.", "To answer your question, I think we're comfortable with this range and we will watch during the year. This is the range that we have made certain investment assumptions to drive growth and we're comfortable that even with this kind of brand broadly the earnings in the medium term need to be protected through multiple levers including digital profitability.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thanks Ranga. And then, just one more question, just to Salil. Salil on this, I just look at it on paper both Panaya and Skava seem to fulfill some of the criteria among those four elements of your strategy that you laid out. So maybe you could just detail for us the reasons why you decided to get rid of that.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi, Ananth. This is Salil. I think the approach we laid out in the four elements with agile, digital and then the core. And we have still have people in localization. Those are the go forward strategic elements we can drive to building out a digital services revenue stream. The two-prong building that I talked about before. And within that we emphasize what we have in our platform basis, for example NIA, on McCamish, what we have in insurance are certainly products such as Finacle and Edge.", "Panaya and Skava, the approach we have taken is, we initiated the process evaluating identification of a potential buyer for it. There are certain criteria internally that we looked at that we would need for all of our businesses to fit for them scale. And there were some of those criteria that Panaya and Skava did not meet in this time.", "The commitment we have with our clients is to ensure that there is two product we have here, something that the current clients you are working in and clients in the future leaving this, we remain committed to this. And off the approach we are taking in terms of a strategic review increased.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thank you, Salil and good luck for the new fiscal year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi. Thank you. I had two questions if I could. The first is, is also on margin, but I wanted to just understand the strategy as it relates to onsite and offshore. In the March quarter. your offshore effort and revenues actually went up a little bit, but I would assume pursuant to some of the strategy elements you laid out that in fact what are the implications the margins as you pursue more digital activities given the waiting of onsite and offshore and then I'm a follow up please.", "Pravin Rao", "Hi, Keith. I will take that question. I think one way to look at it is really segregate our onsite revenue into two components. One is the digital and non-digital. And even if you look at the overall company, they're looking at 25.5%. And when we looked at the gross margin of these 25.5% of the business, it is higher than the quarter IT services. And it is higher than the -- of course higher than the company's gross margin.", "So, we -- the area of course, digital is not a homogeneous business makes sense because it has got a very wide range of services there. But, with the pricing discipline that we have we are confident of achieving better price point in the digital revenue. Even if it is higher onsite component, at this stage based on what we see, we do believe that the gross margin things will be higher than the core IT services.", "So, to answer the question, the emphasis on digital, revenue growth not necessarily mean that those revenues because of higher onset component are coming at gross margin. As today that is not the case. So I think the primary focus of the margin is really to drive further digital without diluting the gross margins that we are getting in digital to better price point. And at the same time make sure that we are leveraging the opportunities across our top accounts. And in [Technical Difficulty].", "Keith Bachman", "Capital allocation versus M&A and you've laid out a strategy where you're paying out 70% of your free cash flow and then also going to pay a special dividend. With that said, emphasis like a lot of the Indian based IT providers -- service providers rather is facing structural challenges. And if you look at Accenture over the last five to seven years has put a heavy emphasis on M&A to rebalance or remix the portfolio. And it just seems to me the risk you're running is weighted towards the capital allocation is not being able to remix your portfolio at a rate that allow you to either maintain or accelerate your revenue growth.", "So while this is a tricky balance admittedly it just wood on the surface seem to suggest that perhaps you should be weighing more to the M&A side. So if you could just speak to the capital allocation strategy that you laid out today and what emphasis that you're going to place over on M&A over the next 12 to 18 months to try to help rebalance your portfolio.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. I think in terms of the capital allocation policy, there are two components to it. First is up to 70% of our free cash flow from our ongoing cash generation. And then, second one being 2 billion on what we have on the balance sheet today. [indiscernible] quite a significant amount on the balance sheet in addition to the ongoing cash generation that we will continue to drive into.", "We developed today at least a view -- a first view of what are the opportunities in the M&A space. And we are proactively looking to see what are those we could leverage into those digital service architecture around the definitions that we've built internally for our future scale up.", "You also saw the announcement today of the acquisition that we did what we call the experience space of digital related to the digital creative agency. We want to continue to do those types of acquisitions and indeed across that digital landscape that can help us position us in this transformation.", "Our revenue also conscious that we have a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet and that even toward the capital allocation policy which relates go through the ongoing cash generation and what it's been today on the balance sheet.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Thank you and best of luck too.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Thanks. Can you talk a bit more about some of those investment buckets as you mentioned 3 or 4 some of your earlier interviews? And then, in that respect, maybe you can talk through a big picture perspective about strategy for the next three to four years. Are we going to see any deviation from what we've seen in the past maybe a couple of pointers here could be helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Salil Parekh", "On the investment buckets we purchased dividend planning for our fiscal '19 relate to investments in finance. First, building out digital capabilities, so turning in an investment in scaling up creating, recruiting and in general giving utilization benefits to building the digital capability.", "Second is to expanding same capability and allowing that to become more focused in the growth area. Growth in sectors, geographies and also in the service offers.", "The third related to our localization approach in the first instance in fiscal '19 investments in localization in the U.S. went for talent, those were that building up delivery centre capabilities and training capabilities within the U.S.", "And the fourth related to refactoring and reskilling of our employees and that cost as it relates to aligning to our future direction namely on the digital and cloud platforms that they are working towards.", "Turning to the second question on direction for the next three or four years as you described. It centered around [indiscernible], the first is the scale up of our digital business, which is today 2.8 billion and growing rapidly.", "The second is to energize of course with AI and automation. And third relates to giving our employees for the future discipline roadmap. And then, fourth relates to expanding localization in the U.S. and in other geography that we operate that direction is there. That is the actual we expect now for the go forward period and we expect to sit with it in the coming years.", "Moshe Katri", "Great. And then, just final question, this is a big picture question. There's a lot of optimism, I guess among the sell side, the buy side that we may see that up tick in demand this year. Based on conversations that you're having out here with clients, are we kind of getting there or at this point this is still kind of up in the air just given the fragility of the environment and given the geopolitical uncertainty out there. Thanks a lot.", "Salil Parekh", "If I understand then, within those client demand and optimism, what we see today, there are segments where there's significant optimism in group, for example and energy utility in a geography, for example, the European geography for us are even more [indiscernible] than rest of the world.", "Overall, in the areas you defined basically service architecture. There's significant optimism and quite a lot of opportunity for growth and those areas become skewed for us and then starts to see the return that is the area where we see the most dynamic growth and opportunity in the market and hopefully we leverage that as we execute on it.", "Moshe Katri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually two questions. One is from the direction of M&A, your latest acquisition seems to be taking your M&A in a different direction especially when coupled with the exits that we are looking for with Panaya and Skava. Could you run us through your outlook for how you're looking at M&A going forward?", "And my second question, again, coming back to the margin arguments, Ranga, if you could just run us through at the lower end of your margin guidance, higher is the margin guide. What are the key elements that really contribute to the margins? I understand that you probably reached a certain limit on utilization expansion, we've already seen headcount additions pick up. So if you could just break it down into utilization pricing and then the investment in fact on your margins for the next 10 months that must be very handful?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga. Here on the margin front, I think in the last year we guided 23% to 25%, we reduced by 1% and we said primarily on account of rupee and to some extent the U.S. talent model. However, we delivered 24.3%.", "Now, this time, the primary reason for guiding in 22% to 24% is to tap the opportunities in digital and some of the investments that we need to make to tap those opportunities as well as in reproposing the sales engine for -- some of the last two pursuits. Third of course is the additional investment that we need to make in the United States.", "These are three principal pieces. Now, the way we are -- we do not want to kind of totally exclude these things I know from our planning standpoint. We will see how these investments pan out during the year and maybe after Q1 to Q2, we'll get a better perspective, but we want to make sure that we keep the range at 20% to 24%, so that no necessary investments, if you have to make and as we made during the year, we will address demanding aspect.", "Salil Parekh", "On the M&A question, I think with the approach we want to take with and title announcement of the acquisition today. It's clearly centered on the digital services space. One of the components of that is the experience area which is where this acquisition squarely fits in.", "Our view started to look at what the landscape is for acquisitions in services across the varied digital components whether it is data, analytics, IoT and cloud. Those are the areas which have detailed components of a digital service architecture. We really examine acquisition opportunities and moving the services claim as we will start to look after.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Salil, I'll come back for follow-up, if you have time and all the best for the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Parag Gupta from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Parag Gupta", "Hi. Good evening everyone. So just two questions out here. Firstly, if you look at the deal trajectories that you announced today they seem to be pretty strong. Now you're looking at the numbers itself, we still probably haven't seen any significant pickup in growth rates across U.S. or BS V or retail for that matter. So just want to get a sense that, is the deal trajectory signaling an improvement in the demand environment going forward. Is it more forward-looking rather than the numbers which are possibly backward looking, or do you think there are some parts of the business that are actually dragging down overall growth. So that's my first question.", "And just the second question on the margins. But again, what I'm just trying to understand is you made one point that there is going to be a lot more investments in digital especially in areas that have seen under investments in the past. What I'm just trying to understand here is that it's being driven by what you're seeing in the market and what clients are demanding for or some of these investments, something that you're making in advance given the way the market is beginning to shape up. So, just trying to get some clarity on that. Thank you.", "Pravin Rao", "Hello. This is Pravin here. I will respond to the first part of the question. From this year we have seen tremendous growth in insurance services. We're seeing tremendous growth in energy and utilities and in the telecom space. We are also seeing good growth in the life services and healthcare space.", "On the -- whereas growth on the manufacturing side and on the DFS -- side of the DFS as well as on the retail side growth has been moderate. In the coming year we expect to see continued growth in energy, utilities, we expect to see the momentum continue in telecom as well. Any comments they run through expect to perform better in DFS than what we did this year.", "This year, if you ignore the impact of -- one of the large product cancellations last year at DFS, if you're normalizing the growth of DFS would have been on similar lines to company growth rate. And in DFS, our -- we have a much diversified portfolio, we have our strong presence in Europe, we have a strong presence in Indian banks as well.", "So, while we have seen some softness in large banks in North America, not in terms of spending up more in terms of diverting more spend to internally rather than through outsourcing. Other than that I think there is definitely continued spending in this bucket. So we remain optimistic about this, but it remains to be seen particularly in the North America where we have seen good growth in both Europe as well as rest of the world.", "I mean not been perfect as I said earlier, we had one [indiscernible] $905 million in revenue. Four of these states where in financial services and three in Seattle space. And this $905 million is the highest TCV in this quarter from this particular year. And total TCV was about $3 billion from that deal.", "The pipeline continues to be healthy and it's across different sectors as well as service lines. So net-net, like you see, they have seen good growth in few verticals. We have seen good growth in among geographies like Europe. We have seen some softness in North America but that's not related to any macro environment issues. So we are hopeful that spend will start coming back to North America this year.", "Now, coming back to where we are seeing some drags, from the sector perspective, we expect continued dullness in the retail space from our perspective. Apart from that some of our businesses like consulting, in the last year or two, we have had some challenges in consulting. We are still working on stabilizing then growth back in this area. It remains center to our strategy we have seen -- I have seen that still work on the progress and we expect few more quarters of challenges before its stabilizing.", "I will pass on to Salil to respond to the other question.", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. In terms of where we are investing in digital, I mean, in fact that was outlined before. Within the space of digital, we have internally detail digital service architecture that we have built which comprises of five elements. And from that we're investing in some cases for example investing in the area of cloud, investing in the area of modernization of application landscapes, investing in the area of IoT, investing in the area of experience. So we've pick a few select areas within the digital landscape where we look to invest and clean up our capability to start to service the need that we see with our clients going forward.", "Parag Gupta", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Hi. Good evening. I have a question around some of the accounting with the acquisitions for Panaya and Skava going to be treated as discontinued operations and therefore taken out of the historical numbers or have they been taken out?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga here. As far as the IFRS standards, once identifying assets held for sale, which is driven by the management's intentions to sell. To reclassify all the assets and liabilities the assets held-for-sale and liabilities associated with that. After that we have to do a fair value assessment and we undertook fair value assessment from an independent valuer and $18 million of impairment loss has been recognized in the consolidated financial statement.", "And to answer your question, these are not discontinued operations. I mean these assets will continue to be generating because they have revenues and they have no cash flow associated with these assets. But we are classifying them as per IFRS as assets held-for-sale.", "And so accordingly what has happened is in the consolidated balance sheet we have called it out both the assets and liabilities and we have taken the impairment loss.", "Edward Caso", "So, the next related question is, how important were Panaya and Skava to someone of your existing revenue such that now you've indicated that it's for sale. Could it impact some of your existing revenue run rate?", "Pravin Rao", "Ed, this is Pravin here. We will continue to partner with them based on the irrespective of whatever outcome or shape it takes. We will continue to support to our existing clients and in future happen for new prospect out of plan if there is a need applicability of Skava and Panaya, we will continue to perform that.", "Edward Caso", "And my last question related again as the, the WongDoody, if I said that correct acquisition. If you got about one -- if you paid about one times revenue call it 75 million. That's about 2.5% growth within the 6% to 8% in guidance. Are you assuming 2% to 3% from this acquisition?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "We are talking about the recent acquisition. Now, this is -- what they have given, 6% to 8% is organic growth.", "Edward Caso", "Is organic growth.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "That's right.", "Edward Caso", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Chopra from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.", "Ashish Chopra", "Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Just one clarification on the previous question as well, Ranga. So while 6% to 8% is the organic growth, does it also bake in the course of revenue from Panaya and Skava as when and they get sold or currently that is not embedded in the guidance.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Well, I think they have taken into account that possibility. Clearly, this is the organic growth.", "Ashish Chopra", "Okay. And the second question was to Pravin, so Pravin you mentioned that overall spending in BFS remains healthy, but there is this trend on in certain primes in North America where they are taking the work back in-house. So if you could just elaborate on how secular or sporadic this is still whether it is really this fits to a very small set of clients. Do you see it happening across a wider set?", "Pravin Rao", "This is -- interesting is normally effective content that we have seen in the past -- if you look back over the last 10, 15 years has been -- we are seeing signs and we have seen acceleration of enforcing and over a period of time it has stabilized and we are seeing periods like [indiscernible] crore divested from those captives. But, today we are seeing is primarily in -- to some extent in -- give us space and also to some extent and probably the unseen state. It's something we have been seeing in the last couple of years, I would say.", "There are two primary reasons from our perspective, one obviously given on the technology disruptions and then sort of looking at building that capability and find these skills and capabilities of other level in India, they want to tap on to that instant capability.", "Second one is, as part of the usual confirmation, one part -- one element of transformation is modernizing their legacy and there is plan for embarking on that destiny there. And some of the plans have realized that they have outsourced that too aggressively. They don't have resident model in the legacy systems so we have seen clients increase and hoping for the purpose as well. It's a combination difficult to predict how long this trend will continue. But it's there.", "I mean we work, I mean for us it's in some sense it's interesting, in fact that grow to some extent. We also worked very closely with captives. We also help in many cases in terms of implementing that captives providing training assistance, recruit assistance and so on. And in many of the cases we have seen our book of business has also improved with duties and captives.", "Ashish Chopra", "Got it. And just lastly from my side, on one of the investment areas, you articulated for the margin guidance on revitalizing the sales. If you could just maybe throw some more light on that with respect to -- are we talking about having more feet on the ground or are we looking at changing the kind of mix with enough sales team or what exactly was entailed around that? Do we do we think we are probably sub-staff or is it a quality issue?", "Salil Parekh", "On the same, what would you like to do to expand what we have in terms of our sales capability. Our sales capability are very strong. However, there are areas and pockets we can go out to more subsectors -- in some areas -- in few European geographies. We could also plan to do something where we want to introduce more digital specialists into our sales mix and also to look at how we can work on account expansion programs. We really are expecting this.", "The primary focus is to expand the sales capacity into newer areas, some we just never climbed in and some intersecting geographic base.", "Ashish Chopra", "Got, of course. Thanks Salil. That's it from my side. Wish you all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois from a DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Hi, there. Hey. During Vishal time as CEO, he set a vision for emphasis that was more product focused and I guess my question at this stage is, is Infosys now planning to move back to more of a service orientation or will Infosys maintain the general vision that was set by Vishal on the product and software front?", "Salil Parekh", "Approach we laid out really talks to scale out digital services state today. We have a huge strengthen in services growth in agile, digital and of course services. That's the primary focus there -- they were driving the business. In addition to that we have what I call a scale platform like -- scale products and platforms. Like Finacle, like NIA which is a strong platform everyone will spend, like McCamish into the space like Edge those continue to be part of our future approach. We absolutely want to be driven to build out our digital services business, which is the primary focus for where our clients are going in the future.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Got it. And I hope to learn more about that. The follow up question is related to the margin guidance, your guidance implies some potential force some margin contraction based on the investment plans that you've outlined here. I guess I also wonder is the margin contraction outlook is partly accounting for risk that could stem from contract profitability issues given that your pricing has been somewhat more aggressive over the past couple years. I'm wondering if the guidance is accounting for potential contract profitability issues that could stem from that?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "This is Ranga here. No, that's not the reason. In fact if you look at two aspects, right, you look at the pricing this year in the constant currency basis, year-on-year price realization has improved by 0.2%. I mean it's broadly stable unlike the mid years. We're pleased to see pricing decline in constant currency between 1% and 1.5%. Second, this is not due to any contract contraction either in the sales or in the margin. This is not account of any of those. It's primarily our duty off investing in certain areas to drive the Silk Road and the sales revitalization and the U.S. timing model which is not to do with any specific contract contraction either in sales or margin.", "Rod Bourgeois", "So. This maybe the follow-up to that just real quick is, the price realization being up year-to-year. How much of that is due to mix and how much of that is due to the price improvement on apples-to-apples deal?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "I think it's very difficult to put number on both the buckets. Price realization is a combination of two factors. One is, of course, the rate cut in the T&M. T&M is straightforward, it is rate card. In case of a fixed price project is also a factor of the productivity that we achieve in a fixed price project after the commencement of the project which is either through onsite exchanges and the total headcount in a particular FTE, due to a better productivity management in a fixed price project. So as you know roughly 50% for revenues, little over 50% of revenues come from fixed price and they have the onsite part as well.", "The second reason for up tick in price or maybe not as much of a downward pressure that we saw in two years ago. Also we are seeing that is still, which is about 25.5% of revenues coming at better price points. So it's a combination of both.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Thank you. I'll yield the line and follow up on some other topics. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Rudra", "Hey thanks. Suddenly the high level Infosys has been espousing a strategy focusing on new services, artificial intelligence, automation and also reskilling employees. So from your strategic reappraisal, are you sort of endorsing that direction or are you making any kind of reprioritization areas. Any clarification there would be helpful?", "Salil Parekh", "Hi, Ankur. This is Salil. The approach we have laid really is focused on building our agile, digital services portfolio. That portfolio today which is approximately 2.8 billion in revenue and where we see quite a strong demand from our client and a large market opportunity. This then combined with revitalizing or energizing our core with automation and AI and reskilling.", "That focus and the localization in the U.S., our focus is really -- very centered on the services aspects plus key platforms and products like Finacle, McCamish, NIA and Edge. With the objective there is to be building relevance for our clients' digital journey is taking them and making sure that we are investing in and building up the capability sets and do with that, but again very much in the service group.", "Ankur Rudra", "Okay. And this is a follow-up on your guidance. I understand over the course of last year the commentary on banking perhaps changed a bit, we were all hoping for a bit of a recovery which was delayed several times. Are you seeing the new guidance you're still baking in a recovery in BFS spending or is that actually an upside to the guidance you stated?", "Pravin Rao", "Ankur, its Pravin here. We have factored on the estimates that are assumption clear are down each of the sector. And that's affecting quarter three, in the coming year, our expectation is yielding much better. It remains to be seen, how much it is based on whatever visibility we have that factored that into guidance.", "Ankur Rudra", "So, just to understand your commentary on banking, spending should improve in FY'19 is that the comment?", "Pravin Rao", "We do I mean -- today, when we look at banking there is some process in Americas, there is spending, but as I explained earlier some of the pending is being diverted to internally to captives. So that's from the Americas side. On the Europe side, we continue to be good traction.", "We are also seeing lot of spend in super regional and Indian banks in North America where we have good presence there. Hope it's a mixed bag. We believe that our portfolio mix -- our diverse portfolio mix will help us in capturing whatever spend that found there to one's hoping.", "So, from our perspective, while we are clear, I have explained, while we have a muted growth, but if you normalize for the impact of RBS, then our growth would be in line with the company growth.", "We do expect next year growth to be better and spend to come back to North America but it remains to be seen. But, based on our estimates what I have said is, our guidance factors into all this uncertainties and mix on estimates and that factored in the guidance", "Ankur Rudra", "And just for the margin guidance for next year, Ranga, if you could clarify, I know obviously you baked in a lot of things here, I think you are baking in stronger wage hike bonuses variable components as well. But how much of the -- lowering of the guidance is because of the step increase in local mix, new skills and investments versus the lack of operating leverage from existing levers that we had in prior years like utilization, onsite [indiscernible]?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. This is Ranga here. I think two aspects one of course is really the priority areas of investment that I talked about that is the primary one. And we do believe that the digital revenue which is 25.5% is that it's coming at higher price point and also had higher gross margin as well.", "We do believe that the rate of growth in digital should kind of minimize the impact of the core IT services pieces that you mentioned. Giving us an effect in the core IT services, the three things that we have been able to successfully do of course is utilization, which is we already said that at the current we are comfortable.", "Coming to onsite mix, which has come down below 29% this quarter and we do believe that we will continue to focus there. The third piece is really in the core IT services looking at the onsite part of the FTEs and we do believe that they have a play in terms of bringing more productivity and get some margin benefits there.", "So I think while we're focusing on the core aspects on the -- dimensions that I talked about, digital revenue growth, the higher gross margin is also important factor for us. And this time, we have also advanced all the salary hikes to April as you have seen and we've also kind of trying for higher variable pay in terms -- if you achieve the targets that we have set ourselves. So all these elements are part of our guidance.", "Ankur Rudra", "Okay. Thank you so much. And best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yogesh Agarwal from HSBC. Please go ahead.", "Yogesh Agarwal", "Yes. I just have one clarification, Ranga, in FY'17, Panaya and Skava were around $100 million, so as you mean they were down let's say 20% in FY'18. So, around $80 million, are you assuming any revenues in FY'19 in your 6% to 8% guidance or are you maybe for six months, are you not assuming any numbers?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Now. Let me clarify. I think both Panaya and Skava posted, their revenues are not material for us.", "Yogesh Agarwal", "Okay. Okay. So it doesn't matter that if you include\u2026.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Very, yes, not material for us. And that did not impact the guidance that we have given and in fact the fixed rate that they have given bakes into account the -- it's purely organic. Panaya and Skava revenue are not material for us.", "Yogesh Agarwal", "Got it. Thank you, Ranga. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Bergin", "Yes. Hi. My first question. Can you talk about your expectations for the slower revenue growth throughout the year as it relates to 6% to 8%? How do you expect that progress throughout the year?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi. And if you look at the Q4 revenue growth just concluded quarter, the year-on-year has been 9.2%. And if you compare to -- and during the course of fiscal '18, we have seen improvement in the year-on-year growth quarter-on-quarter.", "So for example Q2 and Q3 was 8% and now we have Q4 is more than 9%. I think that is and also we have got a decent exit rate that we have seen unlike some of the previous years of Q4, we have had decent exit rate. And typically as you know we are looking at -- given the -- given our earlier profile, Q1 and Q2 typically our first half typically happens to be stronger than the second half that has been the pattern. But, without even -- I didn't want to give a sense that look that is going to continue. But having said that, the good exit rate that we have gives us confidence saying that look Q1 and Q2 are the first half, would be broadly in line with the pattern we have seen in the earlier years.", "So, to answer your question, it is not back ended, the question is which is primarily Q3 and Q4 growth is where it is that's not how we have planned for the street.", "Bryan Bergin", "And my next question, discuss your plans as it relates to augmenting the strategic consolidated capabilities?", "Salil Parekh", "Hi. This is Salil. In terms of consulting with the approach we want to progress is, we expect the significant amount of growth coming from consulting given that's the area that worked closer with the business user. We are working on our consulting business that Pravin shared with you had calculated in fiscal '17, which was typical of the instrument. We have now put in place a turnaround plan to get that consulting, really focused on where is growing in terms of some of three elements and quite a lot of the business linkages that we need to scale up with the normalcy have your buyer on the business side. That is the level of consulting activity that we have which is what we need to enhance in fiscal '19 and we hope to do that over the next 12 to 18 months.", "Bryan Bergin", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.", "Girish Pai", "Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. A couple of questions, one was regarding a capital return, is there any regulatory issue that could prevent you from making a buyback of this 1.6 billion in FY'19?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "If you look at the April 2017 policy based on that we did the buyback right. We did the buyback of up to $2 billion, we just concluded. There are no restrictions, of course, that could go by the guidelines in India, it's a big guidelines with very specific on [indiscernible] et cetera. But, there is no restriction. What the board has stated which has identified $1.6 billion and the mode of disbursement, you can decide later. So that's the thing it's not about any restriction.", "Girish Pai", "[indiscernible] part, would that prevent you from making a buy like in FY'18 or would be a 4Q FY'19 event?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "In India of course there is a time gap which is there between two successive buybacks as per the setting guideline. Typically runs about 12 months that has been the broad timeline. So, that's one aspect. But, beyond that there are no restriction but as the Board as clearly said in our capital allocation policy we have earmarked and the mode of disbursement, we have kept it as flexible and that will be decided by the Board in sometime.", "Girish Pai", "Okay. My second question is regard to the mix between you and [indiscernible] $3 billion last deal DCV number. If you can like, you mentioned, Pravin you mentioned a certain number for 4Q, but can you tell for the full year how much the number is?", "Pravin Rao", "This year the number is what $3 million, so for Rs. 3 crore it was $905 million. So on an average it has been about $872 million to $800 million in the other three quarter.", "Girish Pai", "No, no. The mix between you and net new?", "Pravin Rao", "Q3, yeah. It increased about 32% net new out of the $905 million, for the year, it's about 30%.", "Girish Pai", "Okay. Thank you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from JM Financial. Please go ahead.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Yes. Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. So, on the digital it seems that there is some kind of a realignment in your priorities and the portfolio which you are not going to target. That appears to be more closer towards UPS have been focusing on for some time. So, my question is that, do you think that you could be at a disadvantage here as others have already moved much ahead of this?", "Salil Parekh", "First, what was interesting to see is, the existence of our digital capabilities today. Today we already have 2.8 billion of digital work in the deep line digital services architecture that we've developed. And it's now growing as I said earlier quarter-on-quarter at quite a rapid space in fiscal '18 and we see that's continued ahead.", "That's very much focused on the future is this becomes the growth engine for us given our client's future relevance to this sort of work. We want to make sure that the invests build this out when we have all the full lifecycle of digital capability is available where our clients go.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Okay. And Pravin in the $3 billion of this year, were there any digital deal was so part of that?", "Pravin Rao", "Sorry.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Of the $3 billion dealings that you announced --", "Pravin Rao", "For the year.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Yes.", "Pravin Rao", "See, which of this large deals happen, element of digital, we have millions of deals that were elements of cloud migration and legacy transformation and so on. We have not segregated or computed how much of percentage our digital is, whatever the extent of digital, that is counted towards the 25.5% of only $2.8 billion that Salil talked about. We have not tracked that deal level to say what percentage of this $3 billion is digital.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Sure. Understand. And lastly just, Ranga clarification, the investment in digital and reskilling that you are talking about for the margins outlook, is it building in any impact of any acquisitions also in those areas as part of this?", "Pravin Rao", "No. We are not looking at the acquisitions impact on this. This is primarily on the investment that we need to make either by day of servicing and either through the employee base investments or some of the IP based investments. It doesn't take into account any acquisition cost attributable to this areas.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Sure. Got it. Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Nomura. Please go head.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Yes. Hi. I had one question, you seem to be indicating higher wage hike this year. Do you think this could be an industry phenomena or this is more Infosys specific?", "Salil Parekh", "No, no. The real hike is in same range what we did last year. So I don't see any difference. So, like last year, we will continue to differentiate and majority will be [indiscernible] when we see wage increase particularly in India between mid single-digit to high single-digit understanding with what we are seeing in the last year and it's line with what we are seeing in the market.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. And the second question, though the subcontractor expense has -- they depressed your margin by almost 50 basis in FY'18, do you think this will go up further given the inflation based restrictions that are coming up on the leaders?", "Salil Parekh", "See. One of the things, as you know, the need for subcontractors comes essentially when -- it's primarily of course, it's more than 95% onsite. And it comes primarily when we do not have the required skill set manpower to start a particular project on time due to non-availability of visa or that is also not being available or searching some other products and so on.", "I think awarded course of year, we have taken actions in terms of making sure that subcontractor seeing this, something is a last option after exhausting all the option. And at the same time there are several projects, where lack of availability of couple of resources especially in digital kind of project will decrease the ability of the company to go after those projects. And what we are also do, we have done during the course of the year is also that the price point at which these subcontractor deployed in our projects are higher to make sure that there is a fair amount of diligence and discipline on the margin for the subcontractors.", "So this is something that we're addressing at one front. In the second front, the U.S. talent model is really the core vehicle that we are looking at to make sure that the supply chain aspects that I talked about, ability to staff engagements on time. It's all clearly getting impacted by the visa issues in the second lever.", "I think both are important for us, but in the short-term I think, we're comfortable with the current level. And as we move much more towards the established.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. Just one small one, in terms of digital you talked about what's your q-o-q growth, can you share what the y-o-y growth in digital was this quarter?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "At this point in time, we are able to share q-o-q and from Q1 will be providing more color on the digital revenues. So that is a trajectory that you could depict for all the investors and having let you track", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. Thanks a lot and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from CIMB. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Shah", "Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Salil just want to understand what all three, four parameters you will look for to measure the achievement of the strategy which you are putting forward starting from FY'19?", "Salil Parekh", "It is for us to believe the measure that we will start to, very focused on and this $2.8 billion revenue that I have referred in fiscal 2018 and how that trajectory expands strategically in fiscal 2019 and the years to go at.", "Internally, we still start to look at, how, yes, I call it that, this digital index works across all sectors, across our accounts, when the percentage of rescaling is between [indiscernible]. Are we looking at our account expansion parameters internally and what percentage of what is focused in financial digital. What is good margin and pricing that we see in a digital business. So, in total we design 6 or so parameters that surely we want to drive this business.", "Actually we are now focused on the growth of this absolute revenue on the $2.8 billion.", "Sandeep Shah", "Okay. And second, on the large deal [indiscernible] traditional IT, you guys are achieving this mark of close to $1 billion is achievable or it could be still a work in process?", "Pravin Rao", "Our ambition is to reach that -- we are almost there on an average we have been doing about 750 to 800 [indiscernible]. But sometimes the challenge is, from the cycle times are longer than we anticipate, some of the deals we have pushed to the subsequent quarter. But looking at the pipeline, it's achievable and that's where we are focusing on.", "Sandeep Shah", "Just last question on the margin guidance of 20% to 24% based on you replied to the earlier question, it does not relate to a contractual profitability. So it looks like, it's an investment to write the growth. So, is it fair to say that because your growth as to be up 6% to 8% is not materially different than the 5.8% in FY'2018, so that shows the margin compromise as not lead into kind of a growth in FY'2019.", "But, is it fair to say that once this investment is their forum, next two to three years, the growth comes back to high single digit to a low double digit and your margin can be leveraged because of the growth?", "Pravin Rao", "I think as clearly said earlier this is non-account of any particular contractual contraction either on volume or on slides or anything of that sort. It's not due to any of those factors. It is purely based on our intention to invest in digital areas to accelerate growth in those areas and revitalize our sales to make sure that we are better placed to capture the growth in the coming years. So I think that's the whole intention.", "At this point in time we have guided for 6% to 8% in FY'19. At this point in time, we do not want to comment beyond FY'19. But, our endeavor would be that these investments are for growth and they are not one-off chunky investments or simply cost to address any particular contractual contraction.", "Sandeep Shah", "And just one clarification, this guidance is on a constant currency or will the rupee depreciate [indiscernible] that the pressure in terms of this guidance would be slightly lower?", "Pravin Rao", "Well, I think the 6% to 8% is certainly constant currency, if you are referring to the margin, when we give margin guidance, we always assume certain currency momentum vis-\u00e0-vis rupee that has been baked into the mark.", "Sandeep Shah", "Okay. Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to the management for their closing comments. Over to you sir.", "Salil Parekh", "Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining in for this call.", "In terms of our closing, I'm really delighted we have had a strong Q4, the strong closing of the year. Q4 starting to see growth at 9.2% and its strong operating margin performance.", "In terms of looking ahead, we're pretty focused on our four pillars of our strategy. First, scale out agile digital business, which is 2.8% today, which grew Q4 on Q3 by 3.6%. Second, energize our core apply automation and artificial intelligence and really drive productivity improvement into that and on the business. Third, reskill our employees and fourth, localize and our marketing starting especially in the U.S. with the talent and capability.", "We believe this is a strategic direction that is going to give us more and more relevance to [indiscernible] future and we are looking forward to execute that with the investments that have been outlined for those growth areas.", "With that, our guidance for fiscal '19 reconfirms what we have discussed today, 6% to 8% in constant currency terms revenue growth 22% to 24% operating margin.", "Thank you, everyone again and looking forward to catching up on our Analyst Day Investor Day and the future calls.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of Infosys that's concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us. And now you can now disconnect your lines."]}

A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Good morning, everyone. Let me give you some highlights of our performance in Q1 FY15 and what we see ahead for the rest of the year. Our revenue growth for the quarter was 2% on reported basis and 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Volume grew by 2.9% with on-site volumes growing by 2.2% and offshore volume by 3.2%. Realization for the quarter was down by 0.2% on a reported basis and 0.8% on a constant currency basis.", "Pricing remains favorable carriers more periods except for commoditized services and large deals, which are price sensitive segments. On-site deferred mix for the quarter was 29.2%, fairly similar to 29.4% last quarter. Our initiatives over the last few quarters to optimize our operations resulted in our utilization excluding trainees moving up to 80.1% this quarter, in line with our targeted range of 80% to 82%. Utilization, including trainees, also increased to 74.7%. Client addition was strong in Q1. We added 61 new clients in Q1. We added 11,500 employees gross, with a net addition of 879 employees in Q1.", "Our attrition continued to be a matter of concern. We have taken a number of steps to reduce attrition. We have improved our predictability for employees by giving timely compensation increases this year. We have introduced a quarterly promotion cycle to promote eligible employees quickly. We have increased the variable payout over the last few quarters. We have introduced a fast track career path for high performers. We hope to see a reduction in attrition as a result of these initiatives.", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 25.1% as compared to 25.5% last quarter. EPS for the quarter was $0.84, lower than Q4 last year, due to the impact of compensation increases, rupee appreciation and investment in new Visa. We also paid out $8 million to Infosys Foundation as part of our CSR commitment. As mentioned in the last call, we have given compensation increase of 6% to 7% for our offshore employees and 1% to 2% for our on-site employees effective April 1st.", "During Q1, we signed five large deals with TCV of $700 million. Three deals were in Americas, one each in Europe and rest of the world. Two deals were in manufacturing while one each was in financial services, retail and life sciences. A majority of our large deal pipeline continues to be more around restructuring of existing IT spend of our clients.", "We saw another quarter of traction in cloud, Big Data and infrastructure services with a win of 20 new engagements. Our IMS business had a very strong double digit growth this quarter as the deals won in earlier quarters ramped up. We set up Edge Verve Systems Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Infosys. Edge Verve will have clients serve the needs of their digital consumers and leverage the power of business ecosystems. Edge Verve develops and operates cloud hosting business platforms and products for our global clients across geos and verticals offering these on a pay-as-you-use service.", "Overall demand environment remains largely stable. Based on what we have delivered in Q1 and our expectation for the rest of the year, we have retained the revenue guidance at 7% to 9% for FY15. As you know, this will be the last time I will be speaking on this platform. I took over in August 2011 amongst a very challenging environment. ", "Infosys was faced with several external and internal challenges during that period. Externally we were just coming out of an economic crisis and micro-economic conditions were uncertain and volatile. Our clients were tentative and the decision cycles were longer. Internally we were faced with a number of Infosys specific challenges. On the legal and regulatory front, we were dealing with employee retaliation cases, investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and U.S. Department of Homeland Security relating Visa matters.", "We were pleased with trailing business momentum at the same time. We had not applied for adequate research in FY12, which resulted in shortage of talent, on-site talent in FY13. This led us to hiring large number of people on-site, as well as increasing our subcontractors cost and resulting in a reduction in our margins. We needed to relook and revamp our compliance procedures as a part of the investigation from the government.", "We were also in the midst of the 3.0 transformation, which required us to put new structures and new organizational structures in place. Today these challenges are behind us. In FY14 we completed a civil settlement that concluded investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. A U.S. Court dismissed the lawsuit filed by the employee. All other lawsuits are dismissed or settled. We have aggressively moved ahead in our strategic directions.", "Our Infosys 3.0 transformation is complete and well understood. We renewed our focus on strategic sourcing deals to regain lost ground in the bid space. We made a strategic acquisition of Lodestone to increase our presence in consulting in Europe. We doubled our revenue growth rate in FY14 compared to FY13. We grew by 5.8% in FY13 and 11.5% in FY14. We reduced the GAAP between our growth rate and the industry growth rate considerably in FY14.", "I firmly believe that Infosys today is stronger than what it was few years back. We are investing in emerging areas like infrastructure services, emerging technologies and newer markets like Continental Europe. Through all this we have established a foundation which will take Infosys to greater heights. I wish Vishal and his team the very best in capitalizing on the opportunities that lie ahead.", "Before I sign off, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your continuous support, trust and affection that you have extended to us over the years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our clients, employees, vendors and other stakeholders. I have enjoyed my interactions with all of you over the years and learned immensely from them.", "Once again thank you for the same. With that now let me pass on to Pravin to give color on the business segments.", "Pravin Rao", "", "Thank you Shibu. Hello everyone. I will take you through the various business segments. In financial services, risk and complaints, infrastructure modernization, digital enterprise and vendor consolidation are the key spending drivers. In capital markets there is a huge focus to cut mid and back office costs. Banks are increasingly looking at innovative deals like converting CapEx to OpEx our deals with committed savings. Spending challenges remain for U.S. banks with many discretionary projects being placed on hold or cancelled altogether.", "As a result growth is expected to be muted in both consumer and commercial banking for large banks, although wealth and investment management are expected to grow. Client spending in Europe is however stable. Overall deal activity in this sector is slightly better than last quarter. Insurance sector spend is more in the areas of regulatory compliance and digital transformation. We are also witnessing increased spend in security in COTS and payment segment.", "Though the growth in quarter one was flat, we had a better pipeline exiting the quarter compared to the beginning of the quarter with new deals having come up for re-bids. Spending in the sector is mostly in the areas of annuity testing, maintenance and legacy migration. Spend in retail and CPG is a mixed bag. Retailers are spending on omni-channel, cloud, digital transformation and infrastructure optimization. CPG companies are investing in core modules of SAP and areas like paid promotion management. Budgets are under pressure and focus on increasing ROI is high. Leadership changes and few claims have slowed down decision making but also providing newer opportunities as client seek newer delivery models.", "Deal pipeline in the vertical has improved on the back of creating deals proactively and taking them to the client. Business momentum remains stable in manufacturing. We see demand in ERP led transformation, digital transformation, analytics, infrastructure management and so on. Spending in auto is healthy, under pressure in aerospace and flattish in both hi-tech and industrial manufacturing. Discretionary spending remains low in some of our large hi-tech clients. In Americas we have seen deals around both discretionary and non-discretionary spend while in Europe spend is more towards consolidation and renewal of old contracts. Deal pipeline is better in Europe especially in infrastructure deals while division cycles remains similar to last quarter.", "In telecom, clients continue to grapple with top line challenges which are causing significant budget cuts in some of our large clients. Consolidation within the industry is also likely to create growth challenges especially in the second half of the year. There are opportunities in improving customer experience, churn reduction and operational efficiency for clients.", "In Energy, growth opportunities exist in Oilfield Service segment and helping our clients become more efficient. In Utilities, there is high focus on regulation and compliance. Clients are also looking to simply their operations to remain competitive. In Life Sciences, clients are going through challenges due to reduced product differentiation and pricing pressures in the payer segment. Clients are focused on cost takeouts, compliance and digital transformation. There is significant reduction in overall discretionary spend. We expect our investments in domain solutions around clinical trial management systems, regulatory submissions and digital marketing to generate opportunities for us. Our SAP led transformation offerings, strengthened by Lodestone acquisition are providing us good traction in the market.", "In the growth market unit there are client initiatives to lower infrastructure cost to cloud adoption. We also see opportunities around consolidation of global operations. Coming to BPO, clients are focused on transformation of their business processes. We are seeing a reduction in large multi-tower BPO deals. Deal pipeline has improved year-on-year though division cycles are long. Trends are mixed and vary by industry within BPO with banking seeing some improvement while manufacturing and telecom seeing a dip. Finacle\u2019s exposure to discretionary budgets in the banking industry has led to another tough quarter with the discretionary spending impacted by pressure on bank margins and reduced budgets. We see steady investments being made in channel modernization, compliance, payments and mobility. Client demand is focused on step change rather than large scale transformations.", "I will now handover to Rajiv to talk about the financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "", "Thank you, Pravin. Good morning everyone. I will take you through the financial highlights. Our first quarter revenues were at $2.133 billion as against $2.092 billion last quarter which is sequential growth of 2%. Important to note here is that IT services revenue grew by 2.5%. We had certain decline in revenues in our product business which is why the reported growth is about 2%. In constant currency, the growth was at 1.5%. We have seen our volumes increase sequentially by 2.9% which is significantly higher as compared to the last two quarters and gives us the confidence for the subsequent quarters. On-site volumes increased by 2.2% and offshore volumes increased by 3.2%. Again, important to note that on-site volumes have gone up after a couple of quarters, which is a good sign, which means that a lot of projects are starting on-site and typically the ramp up happens offshore in the subsequent quarters.", "Our on-site mix declined by 0.2% during the quarter. Our gross margins for the quarter were flat at 37%. As you may be aware, under the new Companies Act, the Company is required to provide justification if the useful life of its fixed assets is different from what is described in the Companies Act. Historically, we had different useful life for our assets compared to what is described in the act. During the quarter, in compliance with the Act, we carried out external assessment of the useful life of our assets. I have mentioned this in our recent AGM speech where we mentioned that we are revaluating the useful life of assets. The external assessment covered buildings, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures, since these assets accounted for 83% of our asset base as at March 31, 2014.", "The external valuer determined the useful life of furniture and fixture at five years, the useful life of computer equipment at three to five years and useful life of buildings at 22 to 25 years. Had the Company continued with the previously assessed useful life, the charge for depreciation would have been higher by $22 million for the assets held at April 1, 2014 and hence the change in useful life had a positive impact of 110 basis points on our operating margins.", "You may recall that at the beginning of the quarter, we had stated that our operating margin for the quarter would drop by 220 to 250 basis points due to impact of salary increase, visa and rupee appreciation. During the quarter, the impact of salary increase and visa and rupee appreciation was offset by 3.4% improvement in utilization and the change in estimated useful life of the assets, limiting the operating margin decline to 40 basis points.", "The average dollar-rupee rate -- the rupee appreciated by 2.9% during the quarter. However some of the impact was offset across currency movements which are in our favor. We have also contributed to $8 million during the quarter to Infosys Foundation towards corporate social responsibility as mandated by the Companies Act. Other income for the quarter was at $139 million, which included a ForEx gain of $22 million. Yield on other income was at 9.42% during the quarter. We have outstanding hedges of $1.034 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our effective tax rate for the quarter is at 28.6%. The net margins for the quarter were at 22.6% as compared to 23.2% in the previous quarter. EPS for the quarter is at $0.84 as compared to $0.85 last quarter.", "Our cash and cash equivalent, including available for sale assets and certificates of deposits were at $4.943 billion and as of June 30. This is after payment of an annual dividend including dividend tax of $479 million during the quarter. The DSOs margin increased to 66 days on a consolidated basis as compared to 62 days last quarter. We have retained our guidance at 79% in dollar terms for FY15. This is based on what we have achieved in Q1 and what we expect for the next three quarters.", "With this, I\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Participants we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). We have the first question from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen", "Gentlemen, you mentioned that pricing was impacted by pricing pressure in the commoditized areas and large deals. Can you quantify how did it impact overall blended pricing levels for the quarter? And then in your guidance. You reiterated the top-line growth numbers. But can you make any comments on margins for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the pricing my commentary was that the pricing is stable. We have some part of our business and IT operations service which is under pricing pressure, but we have to look at the pricing as a portfolio. We have three different distinct service lines. We have number of clients and number of geographies and industry verticals. So when we look at it as a portfolio, my remark was that pricing is stable at this point.", "Now this is irrespective of what we have seen this quarter. We have seen a marginal decline of revenue realization per employee, 0.4%, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a secular trend. So at this point our commentary is that the pricing is stable. Even when we are seeing some pricing pressure in certain service lines, our overall portfolio allows us to keep it stable. On the margin front, let me request Rajiv to give the answer.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Hi, Moshe. No, see our pricing is stable. If you look at the last couple of quarters, we have seen pricing moving up and down by less than 1%, which is a good sign. Having said that, the large outsourcing deals are definitely more price-sensitive and they view it, see pricing challenges on them.", "Over the last four quarters there has been lot of initial effort gone into correcting our cost structures and today we feel quite comfortable with the cost structure though there is still some work to be done. But our cost structure is definitely much better than what it was couple of quarters back. This gives us the confidence to invest in the business. The first priority would be to accelerate the growth, because once the Company starts growing at industry averages or industry leading growth, then I think it will be easy to sustain the operating margins. The cost optimization measures can only help the margins up to the point and beyond that the growth would have to kick in.", "So I think the important part would be to invest for the future, invest for the growth, don\u2019t leave any business on table and plan ahead of time. So that's the reason I think I would be more comfortable in spite of having them better than what was expected in Q1. I would still believe that our annual margins would be what we were seeing in April, probably around the same number as last year or probably because depreciation impact 100 basis points higher. But I would not expect the margins to go up beyond that depending on the needs for investment.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen", "Okay, just a follow-up. Europe was sequentially, slightly down sequentially. Can you breakdown the growth by the UK and then Continental Europe and then explain why their region didn\u2019t grow?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I wouldn\u2019t consider that as a secular trend, it\u2019s a quarter-to-quarter aberration. We don\u2019t see any reason at this point to think that trend will continue. So I will not consider that as a secular trend.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "On the pricing front, are you seeing those issues on new deals and renewals and how much of it is linked to demand versus general maturity?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Hold on one second. Can you please repeat that question, it was not very clear?", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Yes. So on the pricing front, I wanted to know whether it was on new business or renewals or both and how much of that pricing is linked to demand versus just general maturity of the business?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I don\u2019t believe that is the right way to categorize it. What we are seeing is some parts of BITS business; business and IT operations business is price-sensitive. So for example application maintenance is price-sensitive. Some part of infrastructure management is price sensitive, things like that. It is not new and old business issue, it is more about which service lines are price sensitive. So in a very broad sense, some parts of BITS, business and IT operations which for us include application development, application maintenance, business process management, infrastructure management, and independent validation. These are the areas which come under business and IT operations. Out of that application maintenance and actually there is some part of infrastructure maintenance would definitely be price sensitive.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Okay. On the demand front, are there pockets of weakness as you discussed or is demand a bit weaker than what you thought it was going to be going into this year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually if I look at the pipeline, the pipeline has marginally improved from the beginning of the quarter until now. Remember now the guidance is a statement of fact, as we see it for us. In many ways it reflects Infosys and its clients. So from the beginning of the year to now, I didn\u2019t believe that the pipeline has improved marginally. There are certain areas where we see weakness. So for example our growth rate in Life Sciences or in Services business is slightly behind our average. There are certain pockets. I\u2019m going to ask Pravin to give you some color on the industry vertical wise demand.", "Pravin Rao", "Overall, across industries two trends are common. There is tremendous focus on taking cost out of the system and that in some sense is translating into opportunities around large application, outsourcing deal, infrastructure consolidation deals and so on. And on the discretionary side, there is again all the savings from cost takeout has been pumped into discretionary side and most of the investment is around customer facing activities. So we see lot of opportunities around retail transformation, around analytics, around business intelligence and cloud and so on.", "From a vertical perspective, we are seeing good pipeline in financial services, in manufacturing, in Retail and CPG. Life Sciences and Telecom to some extent is silent. And geography wise also the demand, we see good pipeline across even through in Europe we had -- our growth was limited this quarter, but it\u2019s not a secular trend. The pipeline is healthy. So by enlarge in most segments; we see descent traction, good traction. And from a services perspective we are a lot of traction in infrastructure management on digital transformation, cloud adoption and so on.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Last question for me, just around discretionary spending. I know you mentioned it. What are your expectations for discretionary spending through the back half of the year? Has it been steady? Do you expect uptick or downtick? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for what\u2019s built into guidance for discretionary spending?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think the discretionary spending is steady, but the nature of spending is different. We\u2019re not seeing large mega-transformation programs. We are seeing small lucrative kind of programs and in many times - in many cases clients actually look at some of it on the quarterly basis, based on their own individual performance. So to that extent, the spending is back, but clients continue to be cautious and the nature of spending is also varied.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Ed Caso - Wells Fargo", "On the earlier call you\u2019ve talked about going to the schools to recruit about 300 sales people, if I heard correctly. Are you also seeking people from the market? And how long -- of these graduates that you\u2019re targeting, how long do you think it would take them to sort of ramp up and begin to be productive on the sales front? Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, on the sales side, I think we have 172 people who have joined us. They are undergoing training at this point and will get deployed pretty soon into the market. The remaining people will join as the year goes by. We are also having open intent for about 144 people to be recruited aboard for our delivery site. So I believe that the 172 who have joined us already will be in the market in the next four - five weeks. And the remaining will come in during the year.", "Ed Caso - Wells Fargo", "And your guidance, are they expected to contribute this year?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, this is Pravin here. We are conducting an induction program for them, eight-week induction program and post that, we expect them to be productive. So they\u2019ll be definitely contributing the second half of the year. And in addition to hiring from business schools, we have also recently deployed about 150 account managers. These are people with delivery background, strong technical background and good understanding of the client and business also in the sales role, with a view to help in mining the accounts better. So that\u2019s the additional bandwidth we have added this quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "I have two questions if I could. The first is on growth. I was hoping you could talk top line growth. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cost structure takeout activities that you are engaged with. Are those finished and what are those? Because I\u2019m trying to relate it to the quarterly growth at about 1.5% constant currency. My perspective is it\u2019s probably still going to be below what some of your leading competitors are. So I\u2019m just trying to understand are the cost structure activities --since most of your costs are in fact in the people\u2019s side, are they limiting your growth and what might be the activities there that enable you to emulate some of your largest peers\u2019 growth rates? How long will that take or what needs to happen in order to get there? Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the growth side, we are very much focused on growth. As I said, we have gotten out of many of the challenges which we had, which were Infosys specific internal challenges. Those are behind us and today we are very much focused on growth. And our growth is dependent on the deals which we closed and as you can see this quarter, we have closed approximately $700 million TCV in large deals alone. And the pipeline, as I said, is stronger than what -- marginally stronger than what we entered the quarter with.", "At the same time, if you look at the revenue growth required, we need 2.2% sequential for the next three quarters to reach the lower end and 3.5% sequential for the remaining three quarters to reach the upper end. And given all those factors, we have kept the guidance at 7% to 9%. But our aspiration is definitely to get to the industry average. It takes time because we have a lag effect, because the wins of today is not -- will not yield the sales immediately. It will take time to build the stock of wins and eventually that will yield results. As far as the cost takeout is concerned, it was predominantly focused on things like onset offshore ratios, things like avenues to performance management and et cetera, et cetera. They have not impacted our ability to grow in my mind.", "Rajiv Bansal", "The whole idea of cost optimization was primarily to become more competitive in our marketplace, and one of the reasons was to fix our cost structures. It is not about cutting cost where it was needed for growth. A lot of the cost optimization benefits have been flowed back into the business. So you have seen uptick in margins primarily because of utilization and other operational parameters being better, but a lot of benefits which have come from cost optimization are being flowed back to the business -- is giving us the confidence to invest back in the business, hire more people, train them better, invest in the market, hire more sales guys, invest in technology. So I think these both have to run parallel. We have to keep again our costs carefully. We have to optimize our costs. We have to get our cost structures right. At the same time flow the savings back on the business to extend our growth.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "My next question is more tactical and scopist. I\u2019m just trying to understand how you are looking at the potential -- sequential growth rate over the next three quarters to reach that 7% to 9% range? And more specifically is the way the year unfolded last year in the September, December and March quarters, is that the way we should be potentially think about it? In other words might September be a bigger impact than the next two quarters? Will December look more like September? Any kind of color you can give us based on the pipeline that you have in front of us on how you see the sequential growth unfolding for the next three quarters?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Definitely the pipeline is much better and the pipeline is healthy, but we have stopped giving our quarterly guidance. So I would not be able to break up the numbers for you as to what we expect in the second quarter and the third and fourth quarter. But as what Shibu said, for meeting our guidance at the lower end, we need 2.2% sequentially for the next three quarters and for our upper end we need 3.5% sequentially over the next few quarters to meet 9%. ", "Having said that, the second quarter has traditionally been our strongest quarter. So we would expect to do -- we hope to do better than that. But yes, a lot would depend into closing the deals pipelined and getting the pipeline larger with every single passing day, winning more, investing more into technology and people.", "So I think at this point of time, we have evaluated our pipeline, we\u2019ve looked at the business in the pipeline and that there are opportunities that we have in the marketplace and we feel that we would be in between that range that we have given of 7% to 9%. But I would not be able to breakup further for you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anantha Narayan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse", "My first question was basically addressed to Rajiv on the margin front. So your utilization is at about 80% right now. Do you have a medium term target that you would be comfortable with?", "Rajiv Bansal", "As I\u2019ve been saying in our all our conversations, I would expect the utilizations to be 81% - 82%. So 80.1% is definitely a good sign. If you look at our utilization over the last four quarters. It has gone up almost every quarter and this has actually given us a lot of confidence with respect to where we stand today with our cost structures. Our volumes have increased this quarter. As I said it\u2019s 2.9% volume increase which is very, very good. A lot would depend on what - the kind of quarterly growth rates you are seeing for the next three, four quarters and investing in people ahead of time. So you would see the utilization moving in a narrow band from here on quarter on quarter, but in the medium to long term, we would plan for 80% - 81% utilization. ", "", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And my final question was on the attrition numbers. Do you have a MIS that sort of captures attrition on a monthly basis and if so, can you just talk us through the trends in the last three or four months?", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, we do not disclose those numbers, our LTM attrition is what we usually disclose. Our attrition as I said is above our comfort level and we are doing multiple interventions to bring it down. Many of them have been done and many more will be done. With that, we are hoping that the attrition will come down.", "", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse", "My question is should we expect sort of -- should we expect to see an improvement in the near future this is more -- this could take a bit of time.", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "Tan is CA, let me request Tan.", "", "Tan Moorthy", "Good evening. This is Tan. While interventions have started, we expect that it will take some time for those to yield results. For example people who will leave us this quarter are people who would have made that decision sometime ago. So we expect that some of these results will begin to kick in over the next two or three quarters and not immediately.", "", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question is from the line of Sharan Gupta from Aquarius Securities, please go ahead.", "", "Sharan Gupta - Aquarius Securities", "My question is related to the growth. So if I can read this correctly, generally the large deals that you unveil, only 15%-20% of their TCV value in the first year of operation and they ramp up later part of the year. So first is this understanding correct of the large deals that we have announced of $700 million and if that\u2019s so, then in order to meet our FY15 guidance, do we -- is it contingent on the fact that we need to win more than our $700 million number, each of the next three quarters.", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "So it is true. When we win large deals, in fact we don\u2019t realize 15%, we usually realize about 10% in the first year of the total wins. And we realize about 15% - 20% over the next four to five years. That is the right way to look at it. Now to reach our guidance 6% - 9%, as I said under [ph] the guidance with liquidity and high percent [ph] growth, quarter on quarter for the remaining three quarters and lower end will require 2.2% of the growth for the remaining three quarters. See when we enter a year, usually we have visibility for 65% of our business. That is what we\u2019ve seen historically and that is one of the criteria we look at when we give our guidance. And when we enter a quarter we have visibility for 95% of our business. So during the quarter we have about 5% of the business which we need to catch up on. During the year we have approximately 35% of the business which we need to catch up on. Now one quarter is over. We are the in the first, second quarter. So we still have some business to catch up with.", "", "Now it is not imperative that all of it is going to come from very large opportunities, because we have -- part of our growth comes from CSI and consulting and system integration space, part of it comes from products and platform space. More importantly part of it comes from expansion in existing programs and existing clients, where these may not be large deals at all. So to complete our guidance, we will need to do all of the above.", "", "We need to win that deals, we need to expand in existing relationships, we need to ramp up the deals which we\u2019ve already won, we need to win more deals in consulting and system integration and products and platform. So it is true, we need to win more of them but it\u2019s also true that we need to do many more things other than that.", "", "Sharan Gupta - Aquarius Securities", "Thank you and just a follow up for Pravin here. Based on the answer that Shibu just gave, so what would be the areas which would be a low hanging fruit in catching up for the 35% of the business for the next three quarters in terms of verticals or deals which you think are, would be more likely to come through?", "", "S.D. Shibulal", "See, this is Shibu. I\u2019ll give it to Pravin. The 35% probably has now come down, because we are one quarter out into the year. See our revenue growth comes from new business as well as expanding our existing business as I said. The low hanging fruit is always to probably expand the existing business and to ramp up the deals which we have already won. That will be the low hanging fruit. And the higher hanging fruit would be the new deals to be closed. And so we have one of these deals, $700 million of TCV we have won. Out of that, part of it is rebate, but there is a big part of it which is not a rebate. If you look at this quarter, our infrastructure services grew by 13%. That happened not because we won the 13% this quarter. That happened because we ramped up the wins we had from the previous quarters. So the low hanging fruit is always existing clients close deals. Then comes the new deals, then comes the new clients. I think I have -- I think I have answered it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Friedman from SIG. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman - SIG", "", "Let me echo the same for Shibu. My first question is for Pravin. Pravin, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that there may be some challenges in the discretionary part of financial services apropos of your comments about Finacle. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that further?", "Pravin Rao", "So I\u2019ll pass it on to Mohit, who heads the financial services. You wanted to know about challenges in discretionary spending.", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes. So I think in financial services we\u2019ve seen a huge focus that our clients have on cost and complexity introduction. That has taken bulk of the initiative within banks. There is a focus on digital rights. So those are the only programs that are getting funded from a discretionary perspective other than regulatory programs.", "James Friedman - SIG", "Understood.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Does that answer your question?", "James Friedman - SIG", "Yes. That\u2019s a great answer. I was wondering, is that consistent with the past patterns that you have seen?", "Mohit Joshi", "I think we are hopeful that as we get into the second half of the year and if you -- if the U.S. and Europe continue to grow, then we will see a larger focus on digital and maybe less of an emphasis on cost reduction.", "James Friedman - SIG", "Understood. And then my follow-up is for Rajiv. I know you articulated your short to midterm goals with regard to utilization. I was wondering in a strategy of extreme off shoring would the company has enough opportunity to increase that utilization rate even further?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Our utilization currently is 80%. This is probably one of the highest we have seen. Our aspiration is to keep the utilization between 80% to 82%. Remember the remaining 18%, about 8% will go in different things. For example, the leave will take away about 1.5%. There is travel which will take away about 1%. About 1% or 1.5% go because of training. You have people on the buffer getting ready for projects. All of those things will take away about 8%, 8% to 9%. So all you are left with finally is about 10%. So it is important to leave the strategic bench because the customers today, the clients today are impatient. They need us to respond to their requirements much quicker than in the past. And we need strategy to win. So I would expect utilization to remain between 80% to 82%.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shashi Bhushan from Prabhudas Lilladher. Please go ahead.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Lilladher", "Shibu, commendable leadership during one of the most challenging time for the company. It was pleasure interacting with you. But my question relates to consulting and package implementation. We have seen healthy growth in our consulting and package implementation business in FY14 and Q1 FY15 as well. What is the nature of growth we are seeing in the service line and can we expect some trickle down revenue due to the same in FY15?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I will give a brief answer and give it to Pravin. Consulting and system integration programs are usually -- we do two kinds of things in consulting and system integration. One is large transformational programs, which are mostly packet led transformation, SAP and Oracle. We start the work with -- consulting work in the beginning and end with implementations, multi-country rollouts and implementations. We truly transform our clients\u2019 business. And some part of work in consulting and system integration is also the residual part of that work, which will lead us to maintaining the systems over a long period of time.", "But eventually it all comes down to consulting all the way to, making sure that the systems are running. The average lifespan on the transformational programs I believe are about nine months. So it is important for us to keep refilling the space on a continuous basis. Let me now hand over to Pravin who can give you more color on this.", "Pravin Rao", "In consulting and system integration, from a consulting perspective we see lot of opportunity as Shibu said. One part of it is around SAP and Oracle led transformation and this predominately in the manufacturing and in the CPG space. Then we are also seeing lot of opportunities across verticals on digital confirmation where consulting also plays a big role. Then our acquisition of Lodestone also has helped us and Lodestone has a lot of strength in the Life Sciences space and we are seeing a lot of success in Life Sciences due to some of the capability coming from Lodestone. So net-net, as long as we are able to tap into discretionary spend, a big part of it starts with consulting and then later on flows down to some of the other parts of the business. And in the last few quarters and even in last year we had a significant growth in our own whole consulting and system integration practice. It grew by about 19%. This quarter also has been healthy. We continue to leverage and take advantage of opportunities there. And wherever there are discretionary spends, we have a lot of opportunities for our consulting play.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Lilladher", "You highlighted about slow start in the retail, and then picked up in May and June. Did we see similar trends in other verticals as well?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. I think retail was more specific because what happened in the previous quarter was due to bad weather and other things. I think retail was impacted and we saw the overhang in April as well. So as a vector I think it was one sector which was majorly affected by the bad weather. And that\u2019s why I think we had overhang from last quarter into early this quarter. But otherwise in most of the other sectors, the challenges are different. For instance, in Life Sciences; if you look at it, the challenges are more around lack of product differentiation, more around pricing pressure from the payers and so on.", "In the telecom I think there is -- if you look at telecom sector, the challenges are on growth itself and there is tremendous pressure to cut cost. So the nature of challenges are different in different segments and within some segments, like for instance in manufacturing, auto is doing well but aerospace is challenged, and high-tech to some extend on the discretionary side is challenged. So we see varying trends across different verticals. But retail was more specific to what happened in quarter four. ", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Lilladher", "Sure. And my last question, sorry persist on this attrition stuff, but it\u2019s alarmingly high. Are we seeing challenges in project start due to high attrition?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think to a large extent if you notice, last quarter we had -- our utilization was around 75% and utilization has improved. So through that 5% to 6% or 8% GAAP we have in the utilization, we are able to at least backfill attrition. So immediately we don\u2019t foresee problems but at some point in time, particularly if we lose good skills or if we lose people, high performing people sometimes -- even though you have people, you may not have people with right fit or right capability. Sometimes it does pose challenge. But then also we always plan for around 78% to 80% utilization. So in the short-term we don\u2019t see any impact on attrition, but in the long-term obviously, we have to arrest attrition because I think we have to reduce our dependence on external hiring. It is important for us to retain some of the best people we have internally. And so from that perspective, it has, but not from a short-term perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Two quick questions. First, is regarding the Big Data. I was wondering if you could split or maybe give us some color about backend effort versus the frontend effort, and any verticals that show more interest in Big Data implementations? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "", "Let me request Sandeep to respond to this. And thank you very much for the compliment. I\u2019ve always enjoyed my interactions. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "", "Yes, this is Sandeep. I think we\u2019re seeing a mix of two types of engagements. We are seeing clients who are just experimenting with specific use cases on Big Data, trying to figure out if they can make for example, better insights in a consumer situation happen or better insights in a product analytic situation or a credit analytic situation. Once they are able to drive some maturity in many use cases, then they feel comfortable setting up a backend infrastructure and drive a Big Data factory kind of concept where the entire enterprise starts leveraging these use cases more systemically. So we are seeing this across retail CPG, financial services et cetera. But the maturity of clients varies here. We are supporting them in their journey right from initial use case pilots to larger use case factories and Big Data as in infrastructure. Hope that answers your question.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Yes. The second question I had was if we step back in history, year 2000, Y2K issues, Euro currency, that between \u201999 and 2001; they were very critical and one of the key catalysts for IT services. I was wondering, are you seeing anything similar to Y2K or anything, maybe some specific vertical that may be, if not of the same magnitude, but something similar?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think there are transformations happening in various sectors. If you look at the emergence of cloud, the emergence of -- the acceptance of a different model of proving services where the client will pay for -- pay-per-use, the emergence of Big Data and Analytics. And the corporations moving away from -- not moving away, moving from information to insights and I also believe that they will -- it will move from insights into intelligence. These moves are enormously transformational because these moves unlocks new value in business. They increase the return on investment. They make the clients much more relevant to their customers. And all of this today can only happen through technology. So the advances in mobile, social and cloud are drivers for new transformations in technology and I clearly believe that these are opportunities.", "Now when you look at different verticals, you would find that many different verticals are in different stages of adoption. So for example, if you look at retail, which I believe is a huge phenomenon, retail, whether it is omni-channel commerce, unified consumer experience, integrated online and brick and mortar services for the consumers, that is transforming the business and that is where the investments are going.", "If you look at financial services, there is risk in compliance. Now there is a move towards consumer experience in financial services and figuring out how the experience from retail can be leveraged in financial services. So different industry verticals are in different stages of evolution, of using these disruptive phenomenons and that is definitely an opportunity.", "Operator", "Thank you. Participants, that was the last question. I now hand the floor back to the management for closing comments. Thank you, and over to you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So once again this is Shibu. As I said this, is the last time I will be using this platform. It has been a pressure for me to be on this platform and interacting with all of you through the years. I have had the privilege of interacting with many of you in person over the last, almost a decade and I\u2019ve enjoyed every one of them. I really want to thank you for the trust, the affection and privilege which you have given me over the last, many, many years. I enjoyed each one of them and thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us.

We thank you all for joining us today to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2011. Joining us today in this conference are the CEO and MD, Mr. S.D.

The full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filing with SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I will now pass it on to Mr. Shibulal.", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure talking to all of you. Thank you for your attendance in the call. We had a pretty good quarter. Q3 was pretty good. We grew by 4.4% in constant currency and 3.4% in reported currency. Volume grew by 3.1% from 2.1%. Our margins are up 28% to 31% this quarter. In the last quarter, it\u2019s 28%. Our pricing is stable. Year-on-year, our pricing has gone up by 5%, that means on a year-on-year basis, we have been able to bypass the revenue collection with the increase.", "Areas of investment are growing fast, nonetheless. Europe, it\u2019s all good growth, life science and healthcare has grown above our average. Client addition has been very strong. We have 49 new clients which we added this quarter out of the six are Fortune 500.", "Over the last nine months, we have added 120 new clients. We saw very strong client addition. It\u2019s also shows that we have \u2013 it also shows that clients are choosing us and that will be a great thing for us when the time comes where they start spending much more aggressively. And they start taking the business when they start spending much more aggressively, we will be the partner of choice. And that is what we are seeing by adding 120 new clients.", "Pricing as I said, went up by 5% year-on-year. Actually, interestingly enough, if you look at the nine month it has gone up by 6.1%. Our growth in this quarter has been all around. The non-top 25 grew by 2.9%.", "Attrition came down on a yearly basis. Last year this quarter, it was 17.4%. Right now this quarter, on an interim basis, it is 15.4%. Now, this means that the controller has been coming down.", "Our new specific area of products and platforms is seeing good traction. We have $300 million of PCB signed up and five deals in (inaudible) and this is sort of consumers have been signed up this quarter.", "This is a different business. This is a business where we have been in the top 10. It\u2019s a business where it is long-term, it is sticky, but having $300 million dollars in PCB gives us the confidence that we are in the right direction.", "We have added multiple deals this quarter. Five large deals we have closed and one transmission deal. Two of the large deals are $500 million-plus including rebates, and a couple of them are in Europe, which again shows that our investment in Europe is starting to pay dividends.", "Our strategic direction Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise is seeing traction with our clients. Now, with all this here continue to operate in a very uncertain environment. There is overall uncertainty. There is Europe in crisis, crisis in key markets. There is currency volatility. There is an election area in U.S. So, there is volatility all around and we have to remain cautious. But these activities are in line. We assume that it finalized in the next four weeks.", "With that, let me hand over to Bala to give more color on the financial numbers.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good afternoon, everybody. This quarter has been a challenging \u2013", "Operator", "Excuse me, this is the operator. Sir, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. There seems to be some disturbance.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Okay. Is it okay now?", "Operator", "Yes. Please go ahead.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Okay. This has been a challenging quarter. In the beginning of the quarter we said revenues could grow somewhere between 3.4% and 5%. But in the events of the quarter, the environment has become much more challenging", "Our expect early indicates on the budget is that it will be flat to marginally down. Discretionary spend is likely to come under pressure in the near term. We are doing a guidance, a last guidance considering the environment in which we operate.", "We have seen the clients becoming more cautious. So even though they had a budget, they have not spent on the budget because they try to conserve cash in the volatile economic environment. So in the middle of the quarter, we came and updated the market saying that it could be somewhere closer to the lower end of the range what we guided for. And that is what we ended for the quarter.", "In rupee terms, our growth sequentially has been close to 15%. The rupee that this should be around 11% this quarter. At the net income level, the growth has been 24%.", "Our operating margin went up by around 3%, mainly due to rupee. The rupee average was 51.37 this quarter as against 46.30, that means 11% depreciation, which could improve the margin there on 4.4%. But since we have incremental costs coming in at around 1.4%, the net increase in operating margin was around 3%. The non-operating income has been good. We get a yield of close to around 9.7% on our portfolio. Today, we are close to 20,000 crores of cash in the balance sheet and the effective tax rate is around 28.6% this quarter. We always said it could be somewhere in the range of 28%, 28.5%, and that is where it is. Today we get around 13% of our revenues, let me say there.", "So going forward, the debt is a business fix up, quite possibly the effect of tax rate could come down. So net-net, we had exceeded the higher end of the rupee guidance for the quarter, thanks to the position of rupee. But in dollar terms, we are closer to the lower end of the range.", "For next quarter, looking at what has happened in the third quarter, we are very cautious in our approach. We believe that generally the third and fourth quarter are tough quarters for us. And even the \u2013 it will reflect even this year and so we have given that slight revenue guidance for next quarter. But having said that, we assume that pricing will continue. That\u2019s what is going the December quarter even in the March quarter.", "So take the last nine months on a year-on-year basis, our pricing went up by around 6%. So what this means is we have focused on high-quality growth that is helping us. We have a perfect platform. Today our utilization is around 36%. We added 49 new clients during the quarter.", "So look at the last nine months, we added close to 120 clients. This compared 140 for the whole of last year. Actually, we are adding more clients. Our growth from non-top 25 clients was close to 4.9% this quarter. So they are coming up, they are moving up on the run rate. That\u2019s a good news for us.", "And the quality of growth is extremely good with the pricing what we saw in the last nine months. Attrition rate has come down. It was close to 17.4% in the beginning of the year. That has come down to around 15.4% now.", "The focus on platform solution business is very high. We have a TCV of close to $300 million of business in that area. Even though it\u2019s small, that is a big focus area for us to achieve a positive growth strategy and we signed five large deals; two of it is more than $500 million deal.", "So if you look at the kind of operational metrics and the kind of platform we have, it is positioned for the growth for next year but we have to wait for the budget to get finalized. Hopefully, the budget will be turn on time this year and will allow greater visibility near term. But the initial indication is budget could be flat or slightly down. What is important for us is the offshore confidence is in the budget more than the budget per se. So I think with all the challenges in the global economic environment, clients\u2019 focus on efficiency is going to be high and that could increase offshoring. Europe could grow faster than U.S. because the level of opportunity in Europe is still much lower than U.S. So the uncertainty increases probably that could accelerate the offshoring.", "So net-net next year, the budget looks more or less flat or slightly down and get a better view on the beginning of the year. But for the Q4, we had given the guidance based on uncertainty regarding Q3 and we had assume the currency at 52 for next quarter. We believe that currency could be under pressure for some time. So around the margin trend, we are comfortable, we have to see how the next year pans out looking out at global environment.", "With this, I conclude, now we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We have the first question from the line of Vihang Naik from MF Global. Please go ahead.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Hi, good afternoon, sir. I just wanted to know about the geographical revenue growth that you\u2019ve seen. I mean, more than 80% of your incremental revenues have come from Europe, so, I mean, what is it that is happening in Europe, and why is not the U.S. not really picking up in the same way?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, I wouldn\u2019t consider that as a secular trend, but at the same time it reflects the investments we are doing in Europe. We have set up offices in Germany and France. The large deals that we have won, I think of couple of them are in Europe, and one of the larger than $500 million deal is also in Europe. So it\u2019s a reflection of these things. Also, always remember that even though there is a lot of volatility in Europe, offshoring in Europe is much lower, and our client that isn\u2019t in Europe has been much stronger lately. So it reflects all of those things, but I wouldn\u2019t consider that as a secular trend unless we see it for a few more quarters.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Okay, and secondly, I mean, your top line has declined in dollar terms by 1.8% here. I mean, are there any project rundowns here, or is it like an orderly acquisition?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, there is no secular trend here. This year, the growth this quarter, the growth has been driven by the non-top 25. We have seen this in quarter after quarter. Every quarter we have seen this, either it will be top 10, top 25, non-top 10, non-top 10. So if you look at the last eight quarters, you will see that the growth is really widespread. It is secular across between segments of the client. So I wouldn\u2019t leave anything into it.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Okay. And lastly, your pricing in constant currency has gone up by about 0.8% toward, has been like-to-like billing rate increases or is there a mix change to it?", "S.D. Shibulal", "They\u2019re both few occasions they have pricing increase and most of the duration that has been stable. They have not been price cuts and there has been portfolio improvement. Also slight amount of non-linearity, I wouldn\u2019t say this much but very small amount of non-linearity yet in \u2013 because of the products in that homework. So if the competence about the \u2013 but the most important thing over the last nine months of pricing has gone up by 6.1% and last one year, 5%.", "That is a reflection of our focus. It is very important, remember, it\u2019s that reflections of our aspiration and our focus. We have always focused on high quality of goods and it is a reflection of our focus on high quality growth, very, very high business value and giving specific partnership, increasing the leverage. These are all foundations for high quality growth, and what you\u2019ll see is the reflection of that.", "Vihang Naik \u2013 MF Global", "Okay. Thank you, sir. That\u2019s it for me.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "Thanks for taking my questions and congratulation on a strong quarter. My first question is on \u2013 if you could just elaborate on the weakness that we saw in the middle of the last quarter where several ramp ups were getting delayed because of the macroeconomic weakness. Was that more specific to certain verticals or certain price?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No. Actually it is, I will revise that but it was \u2013 there was no particular trend in any other specific verticals. We have seen weakness \u2013 we have seen the velocity of the business decisions marginally coming down. We have seen delays in decision-making. We have also seen \u2013 we are seeing delays in ramp ups. That means the programs have just started with an expected design but not ramping up because of signs of lack of confidence. We are not seeing cancellations. We\u2019re not seeing cancellations. So in the middle of the quarter, after the guidance last quarter, we haven\u2019t seen it most recently. That led us to a stage in the middle of the quarter that will be prudent to the lower end. And that is where we ended up.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "And this is just last question on pricing. Again, you mentioned you will be able to get some pricing benefits over the course of last year but expecting the last one quarter after the repeat depreciations, some of your competitors are indicating they might be passing on benefits of depreciation through bearing rate cuts. Have you seen that happened on a competitive basis or that might impact you going forward?", "S.D. Shibulal", "The pricing on what?", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "[inaudible]", "S.D. Shibulal", "The currency. The pricing is \u2013 that is a completely wrong thing to do because you will not be able to negotiate prices when the currency appreciates, right? And so it\u2019s not viable option for us, it\u2019s not the right thing to do because the pricing is independent of the currency, otherwise you have to be able to go back and to monitor if the currency appreciates, either go back and renegotiate all your prices. That is not viable option. However, I must say that line for two to three years and we also get hit by constant currency movement.", "So, for example, this quarter, our constant currency revenue is to-date we go average, the revenue is 1,823, which is 4.4% growth, where as we reported 1806. So there is implication of rupee depreciation, at the same time there is the cross currency movements. So I think it\u2019s the appropriate thing to do.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "Appreciate that point. So I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any evidence of that in the marketplace?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No. we are not seeing it. We are not seeing evidence of that.", "Ankur Rudra \u2013 Ambit Capital", "Okay. Thanks a lot [inaudible] best of luck for the remaining quarters.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair and Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call. I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand the guidance. If pricing is going up and demand is relatively stable and you\u2019re not seeing cancellations, I\u2019m a little surprised that Q4 is flat. If you could just provide a little more color, that\u2019d be helpful.", "S.D. Shibulal", "So if you take the revenue and do some analysis, 30% of our revenue comes from consulting and system integration work, which is becoming a discretionary spend. In uncertain times, the discretionary spend is scrutinized at a much higher level, that\u2019s number one.", "Number two, the consulting and system integration work which we do is not annuity based. The average program size would be to anywhere between nine to 18 months. So it means that every quarter, we will have to replenish the work which we do. That will require velocity in decision making to replenish. So these are all factors which will impact our guidance and our growth.", "At this time here today, there is serious uncertainty in the markets. Budgets are getting closed flat to marginally down. We are not sure about the velocity at which they will take decision to spend the money.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Just to step back though, you had a whole bunch of transformational deals closed this quarter or last quarter. I\u2019d suspect those flow into special integration consulting. So I\u2019m sort of a little surprised that you aren\u2019t seeing that offset a little bit by all the transformational work, these large $500 million deal that Bala talked about, helped that out?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Actually, the last \u2013 so, if you look at the deal closure, it also reflects what I\u2019m talking about. Now as I mentioned, the work closed this quarter is only one. We have closed large deals this quarter. These deals are mostly in the \u2013 actually, all in the operational space. They are multi-year deals. They are large but they are multi-year deals. In this quarter we have only closed one transformational deal. One large transformational deal.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, and then if we go back to last quarter when you talked about budgets, you\u2019ve said marginally flat to marginally up, and now you say flat to marginally down, can you give us a sense of what the tone is and the change and why that is so dramatic in three months?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, the budget, the things we have and the margins have deteriorated after the beginning of the last quarter, that was reflected in the middle of the quarter when we actually started seeing about the fact that we will be closer to the lower end. You know, when we give a guidance, it\u2019s a statement of fact and we expect to be somewhere in between, right? And by the time they came to the middle of the quarter, we could sense the margin differential in the environment as the budget is being most. And the fact that there is a process going in the decision-making.", "That led us to a stage in the middle of the quarter that we will be closer to the lower end. Right now, we are at the end of the quarter. We have seen that we are at the end of the quarter; we are in (inaudible). We have seen a number of budgets have been closed. And what we are seeing is mostly flat or marginally down.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "One final one from me, as you look at the number in your revenue, you sort of been \u2013 Infosys has been driving growth in that. What is that today, the total percentage of revenue in constant currency?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Actually, this is normally revenue has one simple basis. Now, with every license this term. So the easiest revenue this quarter is 5.1% of the total revenue.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Right.", "S.D. Shibulal", "That includes connection. Now this then connects to lower revenues and products are naturally quite small. This is quite small actually, to be honest, $30 million or $40 million. Now the important thing is what is the future. This is a different kind of business, this is a business in which you will actually book annuity revenue in large amount and it will flow through in a period of time.", "So we have closed $300 million of TCV, which will grow into the system over the next four or five years. So it\u2019s a CapEx model. It is an investment from our side which we\u2019ll get return over a period of time. It\u2019s a high TCV model, monthly, year contract. It\u2019s a model annuity-based. So we have $300 million of TCV closed in the product investments stake, other than (inaudible).", "There is other part of the non-linear revenue which is the revenue in places like Infosys management or in maintenance or in BPO, where we price it differently. Not based on effort, based on either tickets or transaction or device or incident. That actually we are not including in this 5.1%, that was about, it would be about 3% to 4%.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, thanks, that\u2019s it for me, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anup Upadhyay from SBI Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.", "Anup Upadhyay \u2013 SBI Mutual Fund", "My question has been answered. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Mehta \u2013 Nomura", "Hi there, I just wanted to know what explains the flat growth in U.S. and narrowed up to, and are you seeing the same impact in terms of the deal-making dealers and the \u2013 as well? And secondly, in terms of our flat growth guidance for the next quarter is the assumption that across geographies you\u2019ll see flattish growth, although in some geographies, that could actually show some declines as well.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Yes, hi, this is Ashok. We have in the U.S. market respective highs, as Shibu said earlier, I don\u2019t think there is too much to be read into the fact that it\u2019s down by a percentage. I think we\u2019ve grown the investment that we have made in emerging markets, are already beginning to yield dividends, as well as Australia where they have a significantly large pipeline with a very high quality of conversion in financial services, whether they\u2019d be spent up in Australia, in \u2013 in China which has allowed us to open up Japanese banks space that are close to us. Mexico, we are ramping up. ", "We are already at 600 people; we are setting up another center. Brazil is too early, so I think from a U.S. goal perspective compared to Europe, I think it\u2019s not a secular trend that too much can be looked into. When we are evaluating our \u2013 what we would be able to achieve next year definitely look at the aspects of the various product lines, various business lines that we operate in various industries and definitely we also look at the geographies or where the biggest opportunities are coming.", "And in fact off the strategies that we have in Infosys 3.0, we expect to see significant traction in the products and platforms space not only in the U.S. market but also in our emerging market and similarly there are consulting and system integration practices that ramps up the opportunities that are opening up for us in a non-traditional market if you will are also fairly high.", "Ashwin Mehta \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Just another question in terms of the decision making details that you witnessed from November onwards and the details in terms of ramp ups. In the beginning of this quarter until now, have you see any improvements there or there has been some more deteriorations since then?", "S.D. Shibulal", "If you mix, it would be marginally down. Totally marginally down.", "Ashwin Mehta \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You\u2019d already mentioned that there were five large deals when two of them being 500 million of TCV. If you could just give us some color in terms of which service lines you value, you did mention there from business operations but specifically which areas business operations and the rebate as well? The rebate deal as well specifically which service line that would be?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes. This quarter we have seen quite a good growth in the business operations area as plans continue to spend on optimizing their business operations and the infrastructure management came out against the reserves and also on the integrated resourcing with combined \u2013 instruction came out and then testing on that, whether that increased and traction that we have seen.", "A lot of consolidation of \u2013 for the provision write-offs and the outsourcing for that deal \u2013 for a business on the route of the population increase.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure and \u2013", "V. Balakrishnan", "Once again, I certainly have \u2013", "S.D. Shibulal", "Just to add to what Bala has said, one large deal is in financial services and the second large deal is in the manufacturing sector. Both of them are in Europe. One is predominantly business optimization through integrated delivery and the other is a combination of that and consulting and system integration.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Just two more questions about that, in percentage terms that we had only what was that, Europe is a difficult market to correct in terms of rebuilds because you have people whom you are not able to easily lay off and then basically pay them six to nine months of salary. So that\u2019s basically degrade on margins. Are these used any different from \u2013?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Yeah. As you can see, the lesser rebuild, what I meant was that part of the work which we are already doing is improving the base level of (inaudible). And your rebuild happens in some locations, for example. We have solved situations and we have solved. And then basically what we do is we consolidate the work that what we have, we look at all the future work and everything is sold to us twice. That could happen. There are other situations there that the clients would look at a rebuild plans with \u2013 over there, consolidating partners. So both happens. When I say all people, that wasn\u2019t what I meant.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure. And as these been one and has been dependent this quarterly (inaudible)?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Out of the five there, will be one place that in under consolidation and two of them on new logos. These in out of the five, two are new logos, which means that to a new client with whom we are not first before, but we are going in a very large lean approach.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure. And just lastly in terms of ramp up, you mentioned that there will be based in ramp ups from new projects, are the ramp up sitting for these new deals any different?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, I wasn\u2019t definitely expecting we have to go down, slight. These deals and I am hoping that will scheduled.", "Nitin Padmanabhan \u2013 Motilal Oswal Securities Limited", "Sure. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandip Agarwal from Antique Stock Broking. Please go ahead.", "Sandip Agarwal \u2013 Antique Stock Broking", "Thanks and congrats on this current quarter. Two queries, one was on the utilization level on those you have mentioned that you are untouchable between the 76%, 30% range, but what is the probability of looking that we will be able to hit the 80% range for us first of all? And second question was more on the application deadline, we are not able to witness as far level to macro expertise but half percent. So if you can throw some light on this, it will be very good.", "S Shibulal", "So on the utilization trend, we are building capacity for the future. Our product lines \u2013 18 months. So because the 70% of it \u2013 is from the campus, and that means that you have to be (inaudible). You are taking an offer is 20,000 next year now. So, and also there is a seasonality split. There is a seasonal split, all of the trainees will come out of training. Because they will join myself year ago to the training of this month, they will all start coming out. And so there\u2019ll be a good amount of people we\u2019re getting in this newer system and that will reflect in the utilization.", "We acquired competence between 76% and 80% because it uses the ability to react in a volatile situation. So in this situation, everything we take that at part, when the client makes a decision, it has to happen tomorrow morning. So we need to have the capacity that we had and that\u2019s very, very important.", "Now, regarding that issue as efficient over \u2013 if you look at quarter to quarter from last year to this year, if you look at the acquisition for last year in Q3, it\u2019s at 17.5%, it\u2019s at 17.49%, and this quarter it is 15.4%. So it has come down by 2.1% on a year-on-year like-to-like basis in the quarter.", "Sandip Agarwal \u2013 Antique Stock Broking", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from Standard Chartered. Please go ahead.", "Pankaj Kapoor \u2013 Standard Chartered", "Yes, hi it\u2019s \u2013 just based on what you are seeing in terms of the buying pattern, do you expect going forward the cautionary spend that you are referring to that could have a higher impact on the volume through or do you see that just putting a higher pressure on the pricing?", "S.D. Shibulal", "See, at this point, we\u2019ve believe that the pricing is stable. It is also important to remember that while unemployment in the year-to-date \u2013 in the online that in overall reported in the industry in which we operate at the end of \u2013 what? It is 3.5%. So it is important to keep this in mind because the unemployment in actually is about 3.5 percentage, very low. So the \u2013 that the pricing to remain stable unless there is some totally catastrophic event. And our focus is to create better and better business value for our clients and that will allow us to always have the size in premium which we incurred in the past going forward.", "Pankaj Kapoor \u2013 Standard Chartered", "And just in terms of the pricing discipline among the vendors, are you seeing any more detail in terms of some vendor pushing down the pricing just to secure volume on such case is going up?", "S.D. Shibulal", "We are very disciplined and it\u2019s not taking different grade to some people are focused on volume; some people are focused on maybe being the largest. And see, our focus already has been to create quality developed. And it is a reflection of our strategies and it\u2019s the reflection of our idea delivering to our clients. It is not a reflection of rate. It is a reflection of what we are actually \u2013 the strategies we are reflecting, adapting and the business in which we deliver to our clients.", "So we do see occasional aberrations and different take, different path, different strategies. In our case, it\u2019s very clear to us that we need to create a high-quality growth. We need to get better and better business value and with more and more capabilities, do more and more compliment programs in consulting and system integration, drive efficiency in operations and drive evaluation through products and platforms. As long as we do that, we believe we should be okay.", "Pankaj Kapoor \u2013 Standard Chartered", "Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS India. Please go ahead.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Hi, a couple of repeating questions. I was just looking at your gross margins this quarter. It\u2019s gone up about 170 basis points. I\u2019m trying to reconcile, I think Bala spoke about the 400-plus basis points positive because it\u2019s currency. Given that pricing seems flattish, utilization seems flattish, volumes have been more or less in line; I\u2019m trying to understand why the gross margin is up only 170 basis points please? Is there any area that you\u2019ve invested in during the quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, there are certain costs like the subcontracted costs during the quarter. And that is the reason you don\u2019t see the full benefit in the gross margin. With the operating margin level, you had seen the impact coming in at around 3% maybe because of currency. So some cost goes up. We do need to make investment. For example, we hired more people than what we budgeted for. We usually have 8,000 people, we hired 9,655. And so all that add to the cost but full benefit of \u2013 will be the \u2013 they will not come to the margin because we have this installation costs in other areas.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Fair enough. And I also noted that your sales and marketing expense in dollar terms seem to have come off almost 10% QoQ. I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s behind that? Is that \u2013 were you making an investment in this area in the last few quarters, and if that\u2019s done and is the current number the level that we should be looking at going forward?", "V. Balakrishnan", "We have more in those certain areas. We have more than 1,000 people in sales and marketing. And we don\u2019t look at the quarterly numbers on all this. If you look at the secular trend, we are still spending enough money on sales and marketing to request for the group. I don\u2019t think we have that or anything.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Fair enough. And this time, with your question on increased hiring vis-\u00e0-vis expectations or expectations of volume growth have much really deteriorated from beginning of last quarter to now and its exactly guiding to either both. So why is then the need to hire incrementally more than what you\u2019ve \u2013 what you were planning to at the beginning of the year?", "S.D. Shibulal", "We are in the [inaudible] expect short-term challenges. We clearly believe that other strategies and also to move very well with the clients as to be aggressive in spending.", "We have very close relationships with our clients and then we are really extremely for them. So we are putting in for the future. We have to be ready when they are ready. And in the long term, where we\u2019ve decided to go check if there\u2019s a trend for it. We are delivering superior business value. We are their partner in term of [inaudible]. We do all those things.", "So in the long term, it\u2019s a very good \u2013 well, good opportunities for it. Even today our pipeline is pretty strong. The only thing is that the deals are not getting close in the speed that which it\u2019s made to be closed. So we need to prepare for the future and these are the investments we need to make.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Sure. And lastly, the 0% growth that you\u2019re targeting for this next quarter, you think it\u2019s a bit of a one-off and there\u2019s a sluggish start maybe because of delays and do you expect the rest of 2012 to pick up because you\u2019ve had clients picking up in the last couple of quarter, is that a fair assumption?", "S.D. Shibulal", "The statement of that as we see it today. Our guidance is always a safe number of facts. And we try to be a fast and we\u2019ve got all the information that we have. When we entered the quarter, we need to see about 95% to 96% of the revenue already booked on February. They were only 50 days. Today is January 10, there are only a few days to raise days left. So this is a statement of fact as you see it, and right now we are doing \u2013 we have talked about the reasons behind our caution on guidance. We are hoping that we will be able to grow. Our aspiration is that we\u2019ll grow the clear quality growth, so we will continue that therefore then. There is no change in our aspirations, and I also don\u2019t believe there is a change in the secular trend.", "Diviya Nagarajan \u2013 UBS India", "Good enough. Thanks, and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you, the next question is from the line of Srivathsan Ramachandran from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.", "Srivathsan Ramachandran \u2013 Spark Capital", "Yes, I just wanted to [inaudible] there\u2019s been some steady growth in the business, and we\u2019ve seen another 10 business deals in the quarter. So I was just wondering any specific intakes into what piece of the cynical that\u2019s being sold or accepted broadly at this point of time in the market?", "Haragopal Mangipudi", "This is Haragopal, all around, I think we have good acceptance of new growth in the interim of our traditional offerings like core banking. In this specific quarter, it\u2019s, some of these deals are in Tier 2 and Tier 3 space of core banking, and some in channel space. Channel banking space.", "Srivathsan Ramachandran \u2013 Spark Capital", "Okay, and then I just wanted to understand there, you did mention that there is some softness I the discretionary spend which should have come on board in the beginning of the quarter. So I just wanted to ask, is it one that we have seen some of the initial or the large, implementation deals from \u2013 of multi going some details coming through there.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Actually, what we are seeing is that the roll out with that in progress are actually flourishing well. We are not seeing growth cancellation, we are not seeing previous slowdowns in those thing. What we are seeing is that the new program initiation, the teachings of the new program are being sluggish. So our current programs that actually are going pretty well and what we are seeing in new program initiations being sluggish.", "Srivathsan Ramachandran \u2013 Spark Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from RBS. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Yes, even during the middle of the quarter you said that for the full year also we will be closer to the lower end of the earlier guidance, but if you look at the revised guidance, the lower end of the guidance launched would be in demise downward by close to 0.7% despite you had a nice revenue of 6%, $1 million coming to acquisitions so, what has changed first to your statement during the middle of the quarter?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So to the middle of the quarter, we realized that there is \u2013 the relation in the \u2013 a lot of it have been come down and this is not taking on that. See for us to continue to grow quarter-on-quarter, you have to normally you need to cover the business even close in our transformations made and sometimes with the operations made and then with new business, right. So as we got closer to the middle of the quarter, we realized that given the decreasing velocity of this might be in the lower end of the guidance. We can see borrowers from Q4 at that point in time to look in the guidance. But once we got to the end of Q3, we had the Q3 in our hand and we could seek performance more closely.", "Yes, at any point in time when we ended the quarter, we only had a visibility of 95% in ASP, comparing to the non [inaudible], we see in fact in the middle of 45% of revenue every quarter. By then you reach now, which is today, you\u2019ve reached the guidance and we know what happened in Q3. We had great visibility in Q4, and that is what has led to the new guidance which we are in now.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "And just for \u2013 to the question which (inaudible) asked, despite the utilization is so low, we still like to believe in investing and adding more people despite the visibility in terms of the near-term has been lowered. So why not the strategy of increasing your utilization and going in collaboration in terms of large dealers?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So, we are definitely aggressive in terms of deals, we have no doubt, at the same time we are focused on quality, number one. Number two, increase the numbers. I would also that are already given. More to the people who are lining and lining in our campus recruitment which happened eight, nine months back. So, and we really are in a \u2013 we have to honor those offers. It is very, very, very important that we honor the offers because we recruit the best talents in the campus, and if we don\u2019t honor those offers, we could implicate \u2013 long-term implications. We need to protect the long-term interest of the business. We have to make sure that we get the right talent, the best talent that anyone in this country could produce.", "So, the dip in utilization you are seeing is a reflection of the people who are coming out of their training and coming into the workforce. In any case, you\u2019ll see this a bit every year. 10,000 people get released from training into production. In a quarter, you will see a bit in utilization. So you\u2019ll see this year-after-year. This year, it is marginally more significant because of the business situation.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Our [inaudible] business operations is 64%, 65% of our business. What percentage of the business which we define as a commodity business where rising pressure would be at?", "S.D. Shibulal", "See, however, our business operation work and not commoditized. It\u2019s very important to note. There will be parts of that which have been commoditized, right. Our business is not entirely commoditized because if that is true, we will not be able to hold that advertising. There is no way our consulting and system integration work which is 30% of the revenue will offset serious revenue productivity reduction in the business operations space which is 65%.", "So we do not commoditize. We apply \u2013 I mean, we drive efficiency, we drive productivity. We create non-lenient, non-network based pricing models. We create innovation at the introductions of multiple service lines.", "Today, everything is positive result. We are able to do much more alignment. We are able to create much more alignment between the service lines which we have. I am not disagreeing that some part of that was maybe commoditized. In those areas, we are driving but then as you can see by their productivity and non-network based pricing models.", "But in general, if you look at overall our revenue productivity were considering system integration, higher than business operations. But both sides, the revenues productivity is stable or marginally up.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "And generally Jan through March has always been seasonally weaker in terms of (inaudible) as you expect by mid of February the budgets may be finalized. Do you believe by the later part of Jan, Feb, March or probably start of April, May for (inaudible)?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Yes. So we are hoping that that will happen. That it will happens in the normal situation, but the concern is coming from the uncertainty and the lack of confidence. If there is no catastrophe between now and that point, we believe that the corporations will get adapted to the new normal which is a volatile normal and start taking decisions.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay. And just a bookkeeping in the fourth quarter guidance, how much is the revenue being built into from the acquisition of Australian big deal company.", "S.D. Shibulal", "It\u2019s 4 million, very small.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay. Okay. And if I\u2019m not wrong, for the next year you have indicated you have given 25,000 campus offers and you are announcing 20,000. So can you \u2013", "S.D. Shibulal", "No, I don\u2019t think there is any change. Whatever we said is what we give. We did not change anything on the campus office.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay. And what would be the total plan out of which you have already given 20,000 campus on?", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Our campus office for next year is complete. You please remember, our recruitment is 70-70. 70% of the people have to come from freshers, that means they\u2019ve been out of college. Out of that, about 80% or 70% come out of campus, the remaining 20% 30% will come just in time.", "Sandeep Shah \u2013 RBS", "Okay, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Viju George from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Viju George \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. All my questions have been answered.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next questions is from the line of Mitali Ghosh from Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes thanks. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the comment I think Bala made in terms of subcontractor cost having gone up. I just wanted to understand which \u2013 why that has been the case that the utilizations have been reasonable?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So you know, we already have some of the [inaudible] is a problem of cost. Actually if you look at the industry norms, I think it\u2019s way below the industry norms, way, way below the industry norms. We already have the requirements on this field to require in certain \u2013 in two weeks\u2019 of time. We not have or we may not want to recruit because these are skilled request on a short period of time. We will not be able to utilize those skills going forward, so the use of contracting in those situations and also there are certain cases there, we will partner with company.", "So for example, we will [inaudible] where we will \u2013 we\u2019ve taken responsibility for their stock support which we don\u2019t do. We will partner with somebody for that support. That also comes under the contacting costs.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Yes and just in terms of the 140-basis-point investment that\u2019s been made in the quarter from the benefit of depreciation in terms of margin. Are there any other areas of investments that you would like to call out in terms of where that is coming because pricing is sort of flattish, utilization on floors actually sort of flat, and offshoring as well, so just trying to understand what those other areas the cost were beyond subcontracting?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Well, we have increased the employee addition. We are, even though on the consumer basis, the date and marketing process come down, the head count basis rate actually has gone up. We are contacting our global clients and business group and putting more and more people with our larger clients. So these are only investments that we are making.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Sure. And secondly, just wanted to understand the \u2013 if Ashok could provide some color on the Financial Services vertical because I think if we exclude the which has done quite well this quarter, I think the growth in Financial Services will probably be flat to negative excluding insurance. And I think Ashok will give a quite [inaudible] October in terms of the outlook for the market there, just trying to understand the root cause this is something quote is basically have caused something more to be available?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So, Mitali, 3.5% growth in the services business starting on the back of about 8.5% last quarter. Typically a soft quarter for us, especially Financial Services. And the growth that time has been fairly distributed across North America, Europe, and I\u2019m very happy with our performance in the Asia Pacific region, especially as I said earlier, Japan, Australia has been very good. If you look at the large deals, of the five deals that we\u2019ve opened, we have two of them in the Financial Services space. In fact, we are able to leverage the regulatory implications, the regulatory changes that are happening, especially in the installing space. [inaudible] is an area where we\u2019ve had \u2013 our whole spend is much smaller than it is in either banking or capital markets. As a result, the opportunity for growth is much higher and that is reflected in that 7.5% growth that we\u2019ve had in that stage.", "Our perception is notwithstanding something Lehman-like happening or something that happened extremely suddenly, like a Eurozone implosion or just \u2013 in our opinion, probably not as possible, we don\u2019t think there is any reason to be bearish on the financial services market. With the investments that we have made, we have built 12 platforms in the company, five of them are in financial services, those are getting traction. Consulting is getting significant amount of traction.", "So our perception is that financial services sector which is about 36%, 37% of the company today, will continue to be represented at those levels. And as we expand more into Latin America and Asia Pacific region, we will be able to mitigate all the potential risks from some of our large clients, maybe not being able to ramp up as quickly. The other quick thing that I wanted to point out is that the 49 accounts that we have opened this particular quarter, 10 of them are from clinical and a similar number from the services side.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, thanks, and just to clarify, this 3.5%, is only excluding and is this in dollar terms or constant currency? This includes the German side which is 0.5 that you mentioned?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, in dollar terms.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Good. Okay, so basically you\u2019re saying this quarter\u2019s sluggishness is more specific to a few clients and not really to be extrapolated?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Exactly. I think some of that is born out of the fact that the bonded deals in Q2, we want some deals. The pipeline was there, but you know winning a deal, having a \u2013 getting a signup is very different from the point \u2013 from actual start. So just to give an example, we had a client, fairly large client that was across a deal and we thought let\u2019s say, let\u2019s start on the first of November. It actually started on the 15th, the 20th of November.", "So, and as a reason for that is they need a lot of set of signatures. They need to do business, to sign up again and so on and so forth. So we basically last about 15, a good three weeks in a quarter which is significant from a revenue floor perspective. So that happened in a couple of days which is a result behind this poor sluggishness. We have no concerns on the pipeline. We \u2013 our only concern is that there is a deferment and delay thing which has crept in. The deal does happen, the deal does signed off, the deal \u2013 and the deal gets \u2013 it\u2019s often started but not necessarily done because it would happen already or when it should have happened.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Sure, thanks. Lastly for B.G. in terms of Europe, if you could provide some color I terms of what the drivers over there in terms of verticals and the services. First of all, what is sort of concentrated in manufacturing and maybe energy and new opportunities or what is sort of more widespread in anything in terms of services?", "V. Balakrishnan", "See, there\u2019d be addition in last \u2013 we added 4 billion accounts in the last quarter in Europe and these accounts have been spread across several sectors, including manufacturing, retail, CPG and financial services. And the large deal \u2013 deals we have had during the quarter, one is in manufacturing and one is in financial services. So the growth has been propelled by different sectors and it\u2019s a little broad-based. Again, services, being the business are the operations including BPO services and the two opportunities have been in the transformation space. So overall Europe growth has been more board-based and even if you take the specific countries, really in the continent, it will be in UK.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. And this would apply to this cooperative meant. In terms of the third quarter, the actual growth that you\u2019ve seen would also have been pretty spread across verticals?", "V. Balakrishnan", "That\u2019s right. And in the number of insiders spoke about what happened in the quarter. So all the data points I shared with you in terms of broad base growth as it leads specific to the quarter. But if you look at the full year for Europe, we have had been \u2013", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "", "No, right. I meant \u2013 I meant the revenue that you\u2019ve already seen in the quarter rather than things that you see ramping later.", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, okay. Even the revenue which should ramp up has been those deals which we \u2013 opportunities which we closed in the previous quarter as well as incremental growth with our existing client accounts, and that both has come from three sectors, manufacturing, retail CPG and financial services.", "Mitali Ghosh \u2013 Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I would now like to hand the floor over to Mr. Avishek Lath and the management for closing comments. Please go ahead.", "Avishek Lath", "Thank you everyone for joining us for the call. Thank you."]}

Bernstein ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Rama Rowe - RR Capital Management  ", "Operator", "At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter results for fiscal 2007 for Infosys Technologies Limited conference call. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Mahindroo, you may begin your conference. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in the U.S. ", "Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and MD, Mr. Nandan Nilekani; COO, President and Joint MD, Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; and CFO, Mr. V Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management.", "We'll start with a brief statement of the performance of the Company for the recently completed quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter ending December 31, 2006 and the year ending March 31, 2007. After which, we'll open up the discussion for Q&A.", "Before I pass it on to Mr. Nilekani, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass on to Mr. Nilekani.", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thanks, Sandeep. I'd like to welcome all of you to this call.  I\u2019d like to give you some highlights.  As you have noticed, the revenue for the quarter improved 13% in dollar comp, and thanks to this strong performance we have been able to revise our guidance for the year.  We have revised it to exceed $3 billion and basically, 40.6% to 41.1% growth. ", "So I think the quarter you are seeing here is really a confirmation of many trends we have been talking about the last several years.  As you know, we have been postulating for some time that what you see here is not really just a business but a fundamentally new business model, a fundamentally deceptive business model; a business model which delivers faster, better, cheaper and more innovative solutions to our customers.  I think that is reflected in the kind of growth that Infosys has been able to demonstrate over the last six years.", "As you are aware, we went public in the NASDAQ first in March of 1999. We had revenues of $121 million and now with the latest guidance for the year ending March of \u201907, we anticipate revenues to grow in excess of $3 billion.  In other words, this company will have grown from $121 million in 1999 to over $3 billion by March of \u201907.", "I think another way of looking at it is that it took us 23 years to do the first billion; it took us 23 months to do the second billion; and in effect, we have gone from $2 billion to $3 billion in one year.  So I think you can see the kind of growth that is happening. I think this clearly demonstrates that it is really a fundamentally new business model we have which is taking away market share from the legacy players in this industry, which is creating a whole new, compelling value proposition, and I believe this is a model that is here to stay.  This model is not just about what we do as a company, but what is the impact and consequences of this model on the existing legacy players? What does it mean for their revenue streams? What does it mean for their prices? What does it mean for their global realignment of the workforce? These are all large, structural challenges that will be faced, and we think that we are eventually driving the agenda in this space and other people essentially are following the agenda that we have laid out.", "I think the other important thing we are increasingly saying is we are increasingly convinced that the world is being buffeted by some major, mega trends. We have identified emerging economies as one mega trend, economies like India and China, which is global GDP and went down to 7% in 1970 is slowing inching back to take a larger and larger part of global GDP, which is very important in tightened markets.  We also think the impact of demographics, with the rise of the young workforce in the Asian countries as opposed to an aging workforce in Europe, which has implications on health care, on dependency ratios, on pension benefits, and the need to get a high return on capital in emerging markets.", "We also see a huge impact of regulation, whether it is financial regulation, health regulations, privacy regulations.  All kinds of regulations which have a huge impact on companies.  ", "Finally, we find a huge impact on technology and businesses in a sense Infosys is a child of technology through change because we are able to have thousands of people trading across the world using one network to deliver value. ", "So clearly, these four mega trends: emerging markets, demographics, regulations and technology, we think is flattening the world and I think it is affecting each and every company, because every company that is in the business of selling to customers is finding that who they sell to is changing, what they sell is changing, how they sell it is changing, where they produce it is changing, where they source it from is changing, where are the employees to provide the value is changing. In other words, everything is really up for grabs, and we think that this transformation is going to affect every industry, whether it is banking or retailing or telecommunications or insurance or what have you.", "We think that Infosys is uniquely placed to be of service in this change, because we ourselves are (a) a creature of these changes; and (b) we ourselves being what we call a flat company, we are in the best position to tell or advise our customers on what they should be doing, because we have gone through these changes ourselves or we have been constructed on the basis of these fundamental changes happening in the global world.", "So we find that this message is resonating extremely well with the customers.  Our customers believe that the world is flattening, our customers believe that they have to go through a transformation. Our customers believe that Infosys is the right partner for this transformation, and this is contributing to a huge impact in terms of mind share, in terms of global awareness of the Infosys brand, in terms of what we can do for them.  I think all of these things which you would think are not really that relevant, actually play a huge role in the strategic positioning of Infosys.  It is that strategic positioning which provides essentially the wind power in the sense that drives this whole thing.", "I think with that context, you will notice that we have had tremendous growth,  and an important facet of this growth is that unlike maybe a couple of years back where growth was due to three or four large customers, what you will find is that this time the growth is coming due to a whole constellation of large customers who span industry, who span geographies. I think this broadening of large customers and creating multiple engines of account growth I think is one of the reasons for the robust growth that you have seen.", "Now there are many, many other aspects to this. I think the other important thing which we have been emphasizing for quite some time is that our growth is fundamentally based on robust, organic growth. I think that we are growing at 40% this year entirely on an organic basis.   The reason again that this is happening is because Infosys focused on building client value, we are focused on building a broad range of capabilities to deal with our clients, we are focused on expanding our relationships, we are focused on delivering value.  These are old-fashioned concepts, but that is how we get growth. I think we have demonstrated that the business model is very important for this growth, an organic model that is customer focused is very important for this growth.", "So I think when we look at the results, at one level we should look at it in terms of quarterly performance; but I think it is equally important to understand how strategically it fits in to the global scheme of things, and how major changes are happening in the industry and how Infosys is leading that charge.", "With that, I'll request my colleague, Kris, to continue with the discussions.", " Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks, Nandan, and good morning/good evening, to all of you. Let me give you some more details. If you look at the geographical distribution of revenues, almost all the major geographies have contributed to this growth. The U.S.A. grew by 12.6% quarter-on-quarter. The U.K. grew by about 14.2%, France 27.4% --these are major countries in Europe. Japan grew by 12.7%, Australia grew by 28.7%. So it is all-round growth from a geographical perspective.", "If we look at Infosys, we had again growth in all the services, some of course better than others like package implementation, consulting, testing, business process management, et cetera grew faster than the Company average. Products also, that has been a colossal growth.", "From an industry perspective, the industry segments which were strong were banking and capital markets, telecom, energy and utilities. So, again, we had all-round growth from an industry perspective.", "Our revenue per employee on a blended basis grew 1.2%, 1.4% onsite and 1.1% offshore. For the past three quarters we have seen that the revenue per employee has been growing. We have seen a 3% to 4% increase in rates for new clients, and about 1% to 2% increase in some of the contract renewals. Now it's starting to get reflected on the revenue productivity. We had 271 million-dollar clients, this quarter 232. We have 61 $10 million clients and 12 $50 million clients and two $100 million clients. The largest client is 6.6% of revenue. So, again, we saw faster growth in our top 10, top 20 clients. ", "From a scalability perspective this quarter, we have added the largest number of employees, 10,795 employees of which 2,560 are experienced hires. Attrition has inched up to 12.9% but we are also much more rigorous in looking at performance and encouraging people to leave. Out of this 12.9% about 2.9% is involuntary attrition, or attrition which is encouraged. Utilization, excluding trainees, for the services business is 80.3%, last quarter was 77.3%. It's partly because of the faster growth experienced this quarter. Including trainees at 68.7%, which represents the huge addition at the entry level, most of those people are undergoing training. We have absorbed salary increases. This quarter we have also announced a long-term bonus for some of the senior people within the Company. ", "During August we were able to maintain the margins. We continue to invest in infrastructure building. 7 million square feet of space is under construction, which will give us capacity for an additional 13,400 employees.", "With this, let me hand it over to Bala to give you more details on the financials.", " V. Balakrishnan ", "Good morning, everybody. This quarter the revenues were $746 million, which is a sequential growth of 13%. Of that, 11.2% is volume growth, 1.2% is price growth. On-site, per capita revenue went up by 1.4%; offshore it went up by 1.1%. On a blended basis, it went up by 1.2%. Gross profit, 43.3%. We had the benefit of lesser visa costs during the quarter. It impacted the margin positively by 1.1%. ", "We also have the currency in our favor. The rupee depreciated by something around 1.4% during the quarter. It impacted the operating margin positively by 90 basis points. Sales and marketing costs were 6.4%. It was 6.8% last quarter. G&A is 8.4%, similar to what it was last quarter. Overall we got a benefit of 50 basis points, and we achieved it because of the scale.", "Non-operating income was less during this quarter because we don\u2019t have the benefit of large exchange gains which was there in the first quarter. Income tax is 3.5%. The effective tax rate is 11.7%, similar to last quarter's. Overall net profit was 26.6% this quarter as compared to 26.4% last quarter. So overall, we had the benefit of visa costs, currency and levered what we saw because of scale, which has improved our operating margin by something around 2.5%.", "Going forward, we've given a guidance of 5.9% to 6.6% growth in revenues for next quarter, revenue being $790 million to $795 million. EPS to be $0.37 for next quarter, which is 3% growth, because we are assuming the currency to appreciate next quarter. Our guidance is based on a rupee/dollar rate of 45.6 for next quarter and for the next full year.", "For the full year we have given a guidance of 40.6% to 41.1% growth in revenues, with an EPS of $1.44, which is 41.2% growth. Our balance sheet today is $2.2 billion. We have around $948 million in cash. Accounts receivable is around 65 days.", "So I think overall it's a good quarter. We have seen a margin improvement. For the full year we are assuming the operating margins to be stable, similar to what it was last year. Last full year the operating margin was 27.8%. We believe it should be similar to that during this year, within a narrow band of 40 to 50 basis points.", "I think with this I'll conclude the financial presentation. Now the floor is open for questions and answers. Thank you.", "Sandeep Mahindroo ", " We are ready for questions. Please go ahead.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", " Yes, thanks, and congratulations on a very, very strong quarter. On the pricing front, what in your view has been contributing for the recent pricing strength, especially on the base of existing clients?", "V. Balakrishnan", "For the past three quarters we have been saying that we are able to get slightly better prices. It's primarily driven from the clients appreciating, understanding that the costs in India are going up and that at some point it will have to get reflected. It is a small increase but it is happening now. In Infosys' case, we are also quite clear that below a certain price we will not take up work. So that is also helping us with new contracts to try and push up our price points.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", "On the attrition rate side, you\u2019ve indicated that if you looked at voluntary turnover, it was probably about 10% for the quarter. For comparison purposes, can you just give us a feel, what was the voluntary turnover  levels during the past two quarters? Was it flat? Was it high? Was it lower?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The voluntary turnover last quarter was approximately 9.2%, and the quarter before that was about  9%. So there are three kinds of issues here. First, our training has increased in the sense that you have to get a certain minimum level of accomplishment to get through training. So there we are seeing people not getting close, so they don\u2019t get in. ", "Two, very importantly, this quarter we had 450 people or so leaving for higher studies, because it's the quarter that it happens. So this quarter it will not happen. ", "Three is, of course, the people at the bottom level of performance who left. These are the three things that drive the largest part of the attrition. In the voluntary part we are not seeing any appreciable increase. There is a marginal increase and that\u2019s caused by the fact that the markets are buoyant. The U.S. markets too are buoyant and that is the main reason.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", "Finally, after we've seen decelerating revenue growth last year, it seems that we're headed towards accelerating growth. Can you comment on this trend?  Is there anything unusual here? Because obviously this is a pretty positive trend for the industry.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. Nandan was saying it shows that this market is better for the clients. They are able to get better quality deliverables at very good price points. So clearly this is a better model, and clearly that's the reason. As companies become larger, clients are more and more comfortable working with us on larger projects. Clients are willing to increase their revenues or increase their services with us. So today we have two $100 million relationships and all the parameters from a customer perspective are growing. We have a very diversified portfolio of services. If you include BPO, the footprint is very large. ", "So it's a combination of all these things, all the things we have been doing in the past five years: starting new services, starting consulting, starting BPO, creating the brand equity, enabling our Company to scale up, creating the capacity to recruit, train. All these things are paying off at this point and the market conditions are right, and so we're able to take advantage of that.", " Moshe Katri  - SG Cowen", " Thanks.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Bryan Keane - Prudential.", " Bryan Keane  - Prudential", " Hi, good morning. Just when you look at your guidance for the first quarter and then the second quarter, you obviously have blown through those numbers, especially on the top line. Can you pinpoint what surprised you? Why the out-performance?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Clearly, the environment is conducive. We got the benefit of better market conditions. Our services were appropriate for the market. We executed well, so customers were able to give us more business. The surprise was the volume, and of course we were able to take advantage of that in terms of capturing that business. So volumes were the surprise and we took advantage of that.", " Bryan Keane  - Prudential", " You mentioned in your opening comments about taking some share from legacy players. Has that been a change over the last couple of quarters that you're seeing now, where work used to go to the multinationals, now Infosys is taking some of that work?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", " Yes. We believe that as companies become larger, this will enable our clients to actually work with us on larger relationships and larger projects. That also has been a cycle, at least, that's going on here. If you look at some of the fastest growing services like package implementation, consulting,  the total number of people who are able to deliver consulting type of service is almost 3,000 today. That is helping us, those transformation projects, consulting assignments, end-to-end solutions, BPO driven, business transformation. So I think it is what is driving the replacement which is happening from the legacy players to companies which are more global delivery-oriented.", " Bryan Keane  - Prudential", "Finally, on the metrics, I just noticed that repeat business was down to 95%; that number's usually 97% or so. Did some clients move away? What explains that downtick?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", " The way we compute it is it is reset every finance year, so Q1 is higher, Q2 is lower. At the end of the fiscal year it will come down to 90%. On an average it's 90%. It gives us better visibility into the pipeline. It allows us to build a deeper relationship with our clients, increases the predictability. New customers are also ramping up faster at this point.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", " Hi, gentlemen, congratulations on some good results here. I just had a couple of quick questions for you. The first one is that it appears here that the offshore movement continues to evolve, with the Indian vendors moving into different geographies, verticals and offerings. Can you comment on any specific areas of growth that you feel you guys are focusing on? Anything new on that front? Obviously the movement towards package implementation is there, but anything new on that front?", "V. Balakrishnan", "From a geography perspective, proactively we are investing in Europe. Europe has gone from 9% of revenues some years back to 25% of our revenues. From a services perspective, it's more business solution driven rather than a technology solution, combining our consulting package implementation, BPO. Today we are able to offer clients transformation projects, transformation solutions.", "We have also come out with our point of view on what the landscape is today from a business perspective and what companies need to do in today's world. Nandan, in his opening remarks, talked about the four major shifts which we see, and we are able to help our clients with how they need to respond, how they need to compete in today's world.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Obviously it looks like demand is pulling the market and putting pressure on the labor supply. Can give us some idea where maybe you expect attrition to be in the future? Also, on the wage front, could you give us a lateral fresher mix for recruits this quarter? I think you gave it in the earlier call.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Attrition for the rest of the year should be in the same range, sitting where we are, seeing what we're doing. Salary increases for the next year should be in the range of 12% to 15%, sitting where we are today. The reason is we don\u2019t see any perceptible shift there. The key challenge you face when you grow out is getting enough middle level people in to meet our growth requirements. Otherwise the base pressure is there but there is no perceptible shift or change. ", "We're also seeing that for the big companies who came into India, who used to raise wages and pay much more than what we pay for people who joined them, they're becoming more cautious and more discriminating. The indiscriminate increase in salaries has come down and they are benchmarking against large Indian companies. So I think there is some stabilization going on there, because people are very conscious that continued pressure on wages is not going to help anybody. ", "So on both fronts I think there is some stability, but it all depends on the growth rate. The growth rate go up, obviously other positions  open up and attrition will be slightly higher. I think that attrition is not a great cause of risk or worry for us at this point of time. We want to bring down the attrition, of course, but it's not something that is giving us very sleepless nights.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", " Just staying with the labor question, as far as middle managers, any rough idea what the attrition rate is at that level? Could you give us a ballpark number of what salaries are at that level?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, middle level is something from three to seven years of experience. Attrition at the middle management level is around 12.5% if you take the entire basket of people. The wages at the middle management level, I would estimate is something around $20,000 to $25,000.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Per year, per year; not month.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Per year, of course. One last question on the BPO front, any growth drivers in that business? If you could just give me the attrition rate this quarter that would be great.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, the growth drivers in the BPO business is the [Effendi] business, [Effendi] is growing; more customers are coming in, we have about 1,500 engaged in [Effendi] and we got a lot more enquiries in that particular area. In the knowledge processing area, the research area is opening up and is seeing much more enquiries. But these are two large areas which are growing pretty fast, along with the rest of the business.", "The attrition in the BPO business is about 28% for the quarter. And it's come down about 2%, and if you consider 25% of attrition is in the zero to three month category. That is very strange in this industry, because when people join they have to go to night shift, some of them don't adjust and some of them leave. About 40% attrition is in the one year to one-and-a-half year's category. Because the one-year people get trained, and the demand for them is much greater than the people below one year. These are the two categories. In the category one-and-a-half years plus, the attrition comes down. ", "So there are two lumps that happen in the attrition and that's for a very particular reason. But we are trying to push it down. I think in the future, attrition rate in BPO will come down.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research.", "Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research", " Thank you. And, again, congratulations on a phenomenal execution. First question is for Bala. You did mention that the visa costs have gone down. I believe that the H1 visa cap had been reached, I think in the month of April. Is that one of the reasons, or is there something else you are seeing there?", "V. Balakrishnan", " No you are right, because we actually reached the visa  investment in the first quarter, because we knew that window was going to get closed. We spent close to $11.5 million in the first quarter. The impact is not there in the second quarter. That is one of the reasons why the margin went up.", "Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research", "Beautiful. Now, other question I had is the consulting team that is led by Steve Black that seems to be doing very well. I was wondering, when will you feel comfortable telling us how many customers did they engage in? And among these various customers, we have in $1 million, $5 million, $10 million, or $100 million segments, among them, where do you see Infosys Consulting having the maximum traction?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Infosys Consulting will have the best value right now for the large transformation projects. It is helping clients resolve what they need to do to compete in today's world and what they need to do in order to transform themselves to compete in this flat world. So we are doing client workshops regarding what it means, what are the drivers. We do assessment, and come up with a program for them to look at the transformation itself. ", "Most of the work, of course, involved changing the technology platform; again, because of the large enterprise solutions we have in many cases, the transformation is led by the implementing a [inaudible] something like that. Again, we are able to help our clients make this transformation.", "So today the focus is really in how clients transform themselves to compete in this world. We have frameworks, we have methodologies, we have toolsets to help our clients do this.", "Chip Chowdry - Global Equity Research", " The last question is on insurance, banking and financial vertical. It seems like all the companies I follow, including the software vendors, they seem to be doing very, very well in this vertical. I was wondering is there something really endemic to this vertical, which is giving a lot of business to almost the whole software industry? Thank you again and congratulations on a phenomenal execution.", "Nandan Nilekani", " This industry always, especially the banking and capital markets, not so much the insurance side, has been a high spender. They love technology. It's driven by innovation and use of the latest technology and things like that. As a percentage of revenue, typically these companies spend higher than other sectors, for example, manufacturing, which typically spend 1% to 2% on technology. Whereas a financial services company would typically spend, maybe, close to 5% and sometimes up to 10%. ", "Some services are completely technology driven, actually. So that's the reason why this sector is a very good sector for software companies, IT services companies, hardware companies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", "My first question is regarding Progeon, did you disclose the operating margin at Progeon?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Yes, let me give you the operating margin for Progeon; as per U.S. GAAP, the operating profit is about 20%.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Okay, thank you.", "V. Balakrishnan", " 20% operating profit. Net income is 21.3% because of non-operating income.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Thank you. Next question is with regard to headcount, I believe that your prior fiscal year '07 headcount guidance was 25,000. Did you update that number?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Yes, 28,300. It is gross of attrition. This is a gross number, not a net number. It is gross of attrition.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Yes. Thank you. And then the final question is regarding the ADR issuance. Could you help us walk through the prospective calendar? It sounds like you are going to meet in November to tentatively approve an offering. But can you remind us, based on the prior schedules, how we should think about the mechanics of the offering again? Thank you.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, the Board has just approved the offering. We are working on the timeframe, we have not finalized that.  The Board approved the re-issue of 32 million  shares to a sponsored second year program, which will include their part of certain public offer we are introducing in [Japan]. We can't share anymore details on this offering, because we are constraint by the regulations of SEC.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna", " Very good. Thank you very much.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Alan Hellawell of Lehman Brothers.", "Alan Hellawell - Lehman Brothers", " Hi gentlemen. I was just hoping to get a little more clarity on your U.S. market strategy. I know that you've invested significantly in large account chase teams. Can you talk about any capabilities that you've developed to entertain larger contracts and whether that is going to be a thrust that we'll see in your contract size in the United States?", "Nandan Nilekani", " There are two ways you can have large relationships, one through large contracts, another through a master service agreement under which you execute multiple projects. Our traditional model, which is very different from the legacy players, has been to have a master service agreement under which you execute multiple projects. It gives the client flexibility. It gives them the option to work with a company for the long term, so that you can take advantage of knowledge retention. You can take advantage of best practice sharing and things like that. But still keep the partner on their toes, because there is always the threat that, if you don't deliver the last project well, I can shift, or I can switch. ", "So that is the bulk of our contracts. It is helpful for us, also, because of the long term nature of the master service agreement we get written into the budget, we are part of the budget process. We are now bidding for larger and larger transformation projects, outsourcing projects. You may have read about the ABN Amro deal in Europe, where we got a share of application outsourcing from them and we are seeing more of those opportunities. ", "What is happening is that, these large outsourcing deals are getting split between two or three vendors. In almost all cases we make the short list, and some of them we win. It's not all going to one company, its going to two or three companies.", "Alan Hellawell - Lehman Brothers", " Great. Well thank you very much.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Hey guys, good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the consulting practice real quick. Can you give us a little bit more color on how many folks you have in the consulting practice today, profitability? And if it's not profitable, when you actually expect it to go profitable?", "Nandan Nilekani", "The consulting subsidiary has 220 people. Consulting, as a service, spans multiple units within the company. We have solution consulting in each of the business units. These are the people who look at industry trends, proactively comes up with solutions. We have some [inaudible] built into it, which has some maybe designs, et cetera and are proactively taken to clients and new projects.", "Then there is a whole area of package implementation, where we start with the package selection, business process re-engineering. Helping customers create the template for their business. Help them with sales management, global roll outs and things like that. Today, we have about 2,000 odd people doing this type of work. Traditionally, you would have classified all these as consulting. We have approximately 2,600 people today, doing consulting type of work.", "Now, again, the consulting subsidiary standalone is making a loss today, because we are still investing in that. We hope that in the next two or three quarters it will turn around and start making profit. Consulting, as a service, is very lucrative especially when it drives downstream, it is giving us the required margins to justify us continuing to invest in that. In fact, the transformation type of project requires us to do program management, change management, business processing which are really consulting type of services.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Understood. A lot of the descriptions that you've just given on the consulting business, the lucrative nature of the kind of work that you are having to do there for your clients. When I relate that back to the profile, the folks that you are currently hiring, 77% freshers. I struggle with understanding how the current mix, which is very weighted towards freshers, will allow you to truly move into some of this higher end consulting work given that those folks are probably not going to be the guys you are going to need for consulting engagements.", "So if you are going to be looking at this business, over the long term, why aren't you hiring more MBA types? Or more folks from outside of industry that can help you truly ramp up this business? Just to get a sense for where you want to take this business.", "Nandan Nilekani", "So, just to give you some numbers, we hired 600 MBAs this year. We are recruiting more MBAs as we speak. We have recruited 2,568 experienced folks this quarter, in just one quarter 2,568 experienced folks. We have recruited 600 CPAs in the last 12 months, especially for our BPO business, they are helping our clients with more of the analytics and more of the research kind of work and things like that; consolidation, closing of books and things like that. ", "And then, of course, we are recruiting in the market also. For example, in the U.S. universities we are recruiting 130 people who are undergoing training in India today. So there is a combination of multiple initiatives, where we believe that we are recruiting the right people for us to participate in this large transformation project.", "Now, you also need to realize that these large transformation projects require a few consultants at the front end. They require a strong technical team to do the architecture, the design and things like that. A very large number of people to do the programming, testing the development type of work. We have looked at the composition of large transformation projects, and structured the pyramid for the company based on what we see as the requirement.", "Now, we don\u2019t want to be a pure consulting firm. That is not our objective. We want to be a company which can help a client do end to end transformation, which includes an impact probably that is what is unique about Infosys. We will help implement and ramp the business operations, which is required today to be competitive. So, we will help implement and operate. So that's the direction in which we are moving.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Okay that's really good. Related to the transformation engagement work that you are doing, what percentage of that work can actually be done first? If you take a standalone transformation engagement, how much of that can you actually do? So, if you break that up between on site and off shore.", "Nandan Nilekani", " So, again, we have to take examples and illustrate this, when we start to package implementation 80% of the product was being delivered on site. Today, only 35% of their product delivered on site. So we have been able to change the outsourcing methodology to move a significant amount of work offshore.", "Even in consulting, which is considered primarily an onsite type of service, over time we are trying to do now second or third documentation preparation, analytics again from offshore. In some cases we are able to deliver 20% of the effort from offshore. ", "So, overall, our hope is that the entire lifecycle, if you look at, it will be 30% onsite, 70% offshore on a blended basis, and that's what we are driving towards.", " Julio Quinteros  - Goldman Sachs", " Okay great. And maybe one quick question on the sales and marketing percentage of expenses, we are down to a level now, I think you said roughly 6.4%, is what I am beginning to model now, on a U.S. GAAP basis. How much more scale of benefits should we expect to see in sales and marketing as we go forward? So, as a percentage of revenue, what's the band that you think this number will bounce around at? ", "Also related to that, what was the depreciation impact in the quarter? How much did depreciation benefit the expense items? Thanks.", "V. Balakrishnan", " I think we will not get major benefit on the sales and marketing side. Most of the leverage may come on the G&A side. Last quarter the sales and marketing costs went up by 1% because we hired more people. This quarter it got normalized, we got some 30 basis points of benefit there. Overall, I think, on the G&A side we can get another 40 or 50 basis points here and there. Coming to the depreciation which is similar to last quarter, we have not seen any incremental benefit or impact because of depreciation.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Hi there guys, nice growth, particularly since it appears you haven't been as aggressive in winning large single contracts as some of your Indian competitors. So my initial question is, is it accurate that you haven't been as aggressive in winning large single contracts? And if so, are you able to hit your growth targets going forward, with below average reliance on these really large deals that are out there?", "Nandan Nilekani", " So, in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year, we have not considered any large deals to be won. Our philosophy, at this point, is that in a market which is buoyant, we don't want to lock up our resources on deals which don't give us the required margins. So we are reluctant to compete on price on these large deals, and lock up our resources.", "So, we look at where the client is willing to structure the deal the way we would like it to be structured. We still believe that we are very competitive and we deliver good value to our clients, better than our competition. But the deal has to be structured such that it would make sense for both of us, for the client as well as for us to take up. That's the philosophy of the Company. So, we are not that aggressive, you are right. We have certain parameters by which we will evaluate each deal, and go forward.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Great, that sounds good. Now, a couple of questions on the margin side. In terms of margins going forward, are you expecting operating margins to decline sequentially in the December quarter and then follow that by an increase in operating margin in the March quarter? Is that the outlook?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Last year, the full year, we had an operating margin of something around 27.8%. In the first half of this year our operating margin is closer to around 27.2%. We believe that it will be stable at around 27%, 27.5% in the next two quarters. On a year-on-year basis, the operating margin will be stable except for the narrow band of some 40 to 50 basis points here and there.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, but are you expecting more strength in the March quarter on margins than in the December quarter? Or is it going to be pretty balances?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Well, it's going to be pretty balanced, because in this current quarter the operating margin is 28.3%, which includes 19 basis points impact because of currency. Going forward we are assuming the currency to strengthen by around 1.4%. So it should be within a band of 27% to 27.5%.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, great. Are you planning mid-year wage hikes this year? We watch the turnover rate move up and some of the supply challenges in the market. Is it possible that you will employ some mid-year wage hikes, beyond the wage hikes given in the June quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", " Well, sitting where we are sitting, and seeing what we are seeing, we don't believe that we will be increasing wages mid-term this year.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, and when you talk about wages, are you talking about bonus and other related compensation on the stock front; are you broadly defining wages?", "V. Balakrishnan", " No, I think the long term bonus is different in that it is more of a retention plan. The impact of this is not material. Wage hikes come only once a year in April. We don't believe that we will be increasing that mid-year. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, so you may give some additional compensation but they will not be in the wage category?", "V. Balakrishnan", " You see, our variable compensation depends upon the profitability and the revenues, and that is variable. But the base level of salaries will not be increase. Variable in the percentage of the base, and the variables may increase if they do much better, and come down if they don't do well, but the base won't go up.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, great.", " Mohandas Pai", " What we did in this quarter, second quarter, is for one particular sector, we gave an interim hike. The reason is that, we wanted to do that in the first quarter, we could not do it because the fact that, at the beginning of the quarter we felt there was not enough money. So since, we saw things go much better. It was an unfulfilled agenda of the compensation structure in this quarter, but its not going to happen in the next two quarters.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, is that Mohan?", " Mohandas Pai", " Yes.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay. Good to hear from you Mohan. Thanks for the explanation on that. And there is just one quick follow up on the pricing front. Can you define whether price on like for like deals is going up? Or is the increase in price that you are experiencing more due to business mix shift than pricing on like for like deals?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Both. We are playing around with the business mix so that we can optimize our margins and do the right thing. We are also seeing an increase of 3% to 4% on new client deals and about 1 to 2% in some cases, where we are able to renegotiate, so both are applicable. Those are two levers we have. We also have the onsite, offshore mix lever where when the growth rate accelerates we have more project starts,  which is what happened in the last two quarters where onsite went up.  But then proactively we bring down onsite, and that also helps us improve margin.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", " Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from George Price - Stifel Nicolaus.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Again, congratulations on very strong numbers. First question is, I wanted to ask about the top account growth, where we've seen the year-over-year growth in your top accounts really seem to accelerate materially.  I am wondering if there is any particular trend that we can take away from that?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Clearly we have worked very hard in creating a basket of services which are relevant. We've made sure that we service the client, made sure that the satisfaction is very high. The size also helps, because as offshore becomes very strategic the client would like to work with larger partners, again size helps in that regard. So it\u2019s a combination of having the right services, executing very well, making sure that the clients are happy and satisfied, and taking advantage of the opportunities.", "The trend we see is that companies are looking at increasing offshore, they are very confident; it has become mainstream. They are confident about the quality of the services and things like that.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Is there any change to the trend? Certainly at one point it seemed like there was a trend towards companies to embrace offshore on a broader basis. They look to possibly add to their list of strategic offshore vendors, to diversify their incremental business. Is there any change, do you see, to that trend? Or is it just the sheer volume of business moving offshore is offsetting that?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Some of the companies are choosing two or three strategic partners; that trend continues. Some of the companies are looking at setting up their own unit; that trend also continues. But as it becomes mainstream this will reflect what is there in, let's say, U.S. or Europe, where companies will do some work in-house, they will have some work outsourced. In outsourcing they will look at two, three strategic partners to work with. Very rarely will a company look at giving their entire IT, hardware, software, infrastructure people, applications, everything to one vendor; but few, very few cases.", "Today, the trend is towards two, three strategic partners, maybe sometimes a captive, a significant drive towards offshore. Even visibility from the Board on what is India's strategy, and especially combining IT and operations from the same vendor offshore. So all these we have anticipated and we have tried to create the relevant services, the relevant client relationship structure to manage this.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Okay. Just a couple of other questions, one on utilization, excluding trainees obviously up significantly quarter over quarter, the highest level we've seen in some time.  I think since back some time in fiscal '05. Obviously it looks like there was strong, pretty strong demand in the quarter, even surprising you. Is that just simply the answer on that strong utilization? Or was there anything else driving it? ", "In terms of expectations going forward, do you think that that level of utilization you are running hot is that going to come down or is it sustainable?", "Nandan Nilekani", " The way we manage this is we shoot for about 77% excluding trainees. This gives us the slack required if the demand is better than we expected, as it was in this quarter, the utilization can go up to 80%. We try to keep it between 77% and 80%; beyond 80% customer service is suffering. So this quarter, the utilization went up to 80.3%. This is actually part of our plan and strategy.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Okay. Last question on the comment that you made on being able to be selective, on deals based on your targeted pricing and margins, and being able to do that given the strong demand. For the work that you don't take on because it doesn't meet your criteria, can you give us a sense of who is then coming into take on that work? Would it be tier 2 firms who are being a little bit more aggressive on price? Any color on that would be great. Thank you.", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well it's typically tier 1, it is a small set of companies today who are getting a higher share of the demand which is out there. It is seen from the first quarter results, second quarter results; so we have to wait and see what happens from the other companies. But if we look at the results of the other companies in the first quarter, the larger companies have grown faster than the mid-sized and the smaller companies. So typically it is the larger, the tier 1 companies who are benefiting from this.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", " Thank you very much.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Rama Rowe of RR Capital Management", "Rama Rowe - RR Capital Management", " Good morning, guys. It's very impressive growth, you guys have almost defied gravity; the law of large numbers says that when you grow, when you become bigger you slow down, but you guys keep on going. How do you see that you will be able to maintain the growth rate that you have at this time? Or that a point will come when you begin to hit the ceiling?", "Nandan Nilekani", " Well, I think that's a good question, and that also we ought to think about that question often. I don't think we have a clear answer, because clearly there is a lot of scalability in the model. The market for the rebalancing of the global workforce in IT services is still not matured yet. There is huge customer demand. So, I think it's difficult to say when this whole thing will reach an equilibrium stage. I wouldn't like to venture a guess.", "The fact is that we have been able to demonstrate scalability in services, and we have been able to ramp up our people from a few hundred to 60,000. In this business there are companies who have a much larger base in employee count. So, I think, all these things are open questions. But we are trying to build as scaleable an engine as possible.  I think our investment in recruitment, in training, in systems and processes, have all contributed to the scalability. ", "I think we need to come to the end of this. I'd like to thank everyone for participating, for a very enthusiastic and very interesting set of questions.", "Please feel free to email us and ask us more questions about the business performance, the direction. Let me once again state that we believe that we are at a whole new point in this business. Our model is increasingly the sustainable model and it's having a huge impact on global players. ", "I would urge you to study this industry not just as what is happening in India, but what are the global impact  and the consequences thereof. Thank you very much.", "Operator", " Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the second quarter results for fiscal 2007, for Infosys Technologies Ltd Conference Call.

My name is Angela, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Infosys Technologies\u2019 Q3 '07 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, Mr. Mahindroo, you may begin your conference.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to this conference call to discuss Infosys' financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Let me start by wishing you all a very happy and prosperous 2007.", "Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and MD, Mr. Nandan Nilekani; President, COO, and Joint MD, Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; and CFO, Mr. V Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management.", "We'll start with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2007. After that, we'll open up the discussion for the Q&A.", "Before I pass it on to Mr. Nilekani, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. Nilekani.", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thank you, and I'd like to welcome all of you to this call, this evening Indian time, and morning in the U.S., and happy New Year to all of you, and let me give you a brief overview of the business, and then Kris will continue and then Bala will talk from the finance side.", "I think, we have had another good quarter. We have had sequential growth as you have seen of 10.1%. This happens to be the third consecutive quarter where we have delivered double digit revenue growth in dollar terms. So we believe that this is an endorsement and validation of our strategy of building the brand, building our transformation capability, and our investments is enriching and synergizing our portfolio of services, so that we can create compelling value propositions for our client.", "While we have grown 10.1% this quarter, we have also given our guidance for the next quarter, where we expect revenues to grow between 4.6% to 4.9%. And for the year, we expect revenues in dollar terms to grow at 43.6% in this fiscal year.", "The revenue for this quarter was at $821 million, and our earnings per ADS has gone up to $0.39 from $0.26 in the previous quarter, with an addition of 43 new clients.", "While we have grown at double digits in dollar terms, in rupee terms our growth has been more modest. It has been at 5.9%, essentially because the rupee appreciated at around 3.8% for the year, and therefore we lost about 145 crores of revenue due to rupee appreciation. But even here, I think given the fact that typically 1% appreciation of the rupee cost us 0.5% of operating margin. If nothing else had changed, this rupee appreciation would have cost us about 2 percentage points of operating margin reduction, but thanks to an improvement in revenue productivity, thanks to an improvement in license revenue in Finacle, thanks to scale benefits on SG&A. We have been able to offset the negative impact of operating margin on currency by a positive impact through essentially, productivity, efficiency and value realization. And therefore the net impact in fact of all this was positive, and the operating margin overall has gone up by 20 basis points, in spite of the rupee appreciation. So, we think that's a strong signal for the robustness of the business model.", "We also believe that the story continues, we think that the outlook is strong. We think offshoring continues to be a strong secular trend. While we believe that IT spending will go up by a few percentage points in this year, we believe the trend of our clients to increase. The proportion of their spend on offshore and global sourcing is going to go up, which will play in our favor. We also believe that the risk perception of our clients about offshoring has reduced even further, and now they are quite comfortable with having several thousand employees of theirs working in India, through various partnerships or through their own units. So, I think, the risk perception in the mind of the global CEO has come down, and we think that's a positive sign for the future of this industry.", "With this, I'll pass it on to my colleague Kris Gopalakrishnan, President, to delve into some more aspects of our business performance.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Thank you, Nandan, and let me also wish you all a Happy New Year. In nine months of this fiscal, we've had revenue of $2.23 billion, which crossed the revenue for the full fiscal last year. In the last year full fiscal, the revenue was $2.15 billion, and nine months revenue this time is $2.23 billion.", "Also in the BFSI space we have crossed billion dollars in revenue. BFSI is today 38.6% of our revenues, up from 37.4% revenues from last quarter, and we've crossed $1 billion in BFSI space.", "In BPO also in the first nine months of this fiscal, we've crossed $100 million. So there are several parts of the business, several segments of the business, which have contributed to this growth. Just to highlight this, Nandan talked about products doing well, products have gone to 4.3%. Europe has gone to 26.8% of revenues from 25.8%. Package implementation has gone to 17.9% from 17.0%. In the BFSI space itself, insurance has gone from 6.7% to 7.6%. Retail has gone to 10.5% from 9%. Services companies have gone from 7.7% to 8.3%.", "The top 25 clients have grown 12.6% compared to a company growth of 10.1%, and if we include the holidays for this quarter, actually the growth would have been closer to about 13%. So good all round performance and good growth, and in spite of the rupee appreciation, as Nandan said, we have been able to maintain the margins. Infosys today has 488 active clients, we added 43 clients this quarter compared to 45 last quarter. So the client additions continue to be robust.", "We have 256, $1 million relationships; 67, $10 million relationships; 11, $50 million relationship; and 2, $100 million relationships. We added 6,092 employees this quarter at a gross level, of which 1,676 employees were with prior experience and came in the lateral -- came laterally. So, we continue to add experienced employees to the workforce. Attrition is slightly up at 13.5% compared to 12.9% last quarter. Attrition, if I exclude involuntary separation, especially at the entry-level, it comes down to 12.2%. The corresponding number last quarter is 12%. Top client contributed 6.9% to the revenues. Repeat business continues to be very strong at 94.7%. Accounts receivable 63 days.", "So again the story is that all round performance, good performance. And now let me pass it onto Bala, the CFO, to continue the discussion.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Thank you, Kris. Good morning, everybody. We have seen strong growth in revenues this quarter. Sequentially, the revenues grew by 10.1% to $821 million for the quarter. We had seen the margins improving. The gross margin this quarter was 43% as compared to 43.3% last quarter. We got some benefit on the SG&A side. The SG&A is 14.5% of our revenues as compared to 15% last quarter, the profit before tax 30.1% to 30.2% last quarter, the effective tax rate continued to remain at 11.7%, and we had a net margin of 26.5%.", "This quarter the currency behaved more erratically. The rupee appreciated by 3.8%. The average rupee-dollar rate last quarter was 46.29. This quarter it was 44.53, resulting in appreciation of 3.8%. It impacted the operating margin by 2 percentage points. We had some offsetting factors. The product revenues grew sequentially by 27.5% from 28 million in Q2 to 35 million in Q3. It impacted positively the margins by 80 basis points. We had the blended per capita revenue going up by 1.4%, 1.9% on-site and 1.7% offshore. That gave a positive impact of 80 basis points to the margin and we had the scale benefit on the SG&A of 50 basis points.", "Net-net, we had 2 percentage point impact on the margins because of the currency, which was offset by 80 basis points due to billing rate increase, 80 basis points due to product revenues going up, and 50 basis points due to the SG&A scale benefit. So, we are able to maintain the margins in spite of substantial appreciation in rupee for the quarter.", "For the next quarter, we had given a guidance of increasing revenues of somewhere between 4.6% to 4.9% with the EPS growth of 2.6% to 2.6%. We are assuming the rupee-dollar rate to be at 44.11 for next quarter. We take the Federal Reserve Bank rate -- loan buying rate for our currency purposes. It was 44.11 as of December end. We are considering the same thing for our next quarter guidance. For the next quarter guidance, the EPS growth has been slower than revenue growth mainly because of currency otherwise the margins are almost similar to what you had seen in the third quarter.", "Coming to subsidiaries, there are four subsidiaries. Progeon had revenue of $40 million with a net profit of 22.4%. Last quarter, they had a net profit margin of 21.3%. Infosys Australia, $24 million revenue with a 14% net income margin. Last quarter, they had revenue of $25 million. Infosys Consulting, $12 million of revenue with $6.5 million of losses. Last quarter they had a loss of $3.2 million. They are still in the investment phase. They are growing. They may breakeven in the next few quarters, but right now they are in the investment phase. Infosys China, $5 million revenue with a loss of $1 million. Last quarter the loss was, well, similar, $1 million.", "So net-net, we had observed the impact of currency. We are able to maintain the margins, able to grow faster. For the third consecutive quarter, we had double-digit growth in revenues. I think it's very significant.", "With this I conclude my opening remarks. Now we can open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Bryan Keane of Prudential.", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Hi guys. Very solid quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about pricing, the pricing environment? We hear a lot of different things. I guess -- and you can break it up between new deals, and then what you are seeing on renewals?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Pricing continues to remain favorable with an upward bias. For the new customers, we are getting about 3% to 4% above our average. For the existing customers, when we renegotiate, we are getting probably close to that, totaling may be 2% to 4% above our average. And our revenue productivity blended has gone up by 1.4% this quarter. The onsite revenue productivity has gone up by 1.9%. The offshore revenue productivity has gone up by 1.7%. That is on a quarter-to-quarter basis. On the year-to-year basis, that is if you look at last year versus this year, the onsite has gone up by 3.7%. Offshore has gone up by 2.1%, and the blended has gone up by 4.3%. So, the rate increase is actually showing up in our revenue productivity over a period of time and it is also showing in our margins.", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Right, and also the margins were quite good. They were benefited by the amount of effort that moved -- continue to move towards the mix towards offshore. What -- can that mix continue to go, I don\u2019t know if 75% to 80% and that seem to have a lot of leverage on the margin. Even though utilization fell, it looked like the effort moving more towards offshore was the key?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Our target for onsite versus offshore is to keep onsite between 30% to 35%, so right now it's around 32%, actually 32.7% to be precise, and last quarter, it was 33%. So, that is the range at which we will keep this. As we add new services, we look at services, which have significant offshore content like infrastructure management, testing, et cetera. On the other side, consulting, package implementation, they are more onsite-centric. But when we combine all these things the ratio is still maintained, again, kind of retaining our operating margins.", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay. And then just finally on the guidance, as you guys stated you have grown double digit sequentially for three consecutive quarters, but for the fourth quarter, it looks like it's more the mid-point of the range sequentially is like 4.7% or 4.6 somewhere in there. What's the reason for the drop off and is it some seasonality or what can explain that to go to mid single digits from the double digits you guys have been putting up sequentially?", "V. Balakrishnan", "For our clients, this quarter is the quarter in which their budgets are finalized and frozen et cetera. So, though we have grown sequentially and we have said that for the year we would grow at about 43.5%, last quarter of course 10.1% we'd said, given the visibility we have right now and the budgets have been frozen, we have given a guidance of about 4.9% growth this quarter. And if you look back, I don\u2019t know for past 3, 4 years, our guidance in Q4 typically has been lower, and given that, our utilization today is about 77.7%, we have the ability if really the opportunity comes our way to grow faster.", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Thanks and congratulations on a solid quarter. Can you talk a bit about the deceleration in sequential revenue growth rate from your top 5 and top 10 clients? And then, in the same context, also by vertical we have seen a deceleration in manufacturing and telecom verticals, thanks?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The top 25 clients grew by 12.6% sequentially. The growth in -- I am just getting there rightly, top five clients grew by 18.9% -- sorry 10.4%, top 25 clients grew by 12.6%. That\u2019s on the client side.", "From a industry vertical perspective, of course, we have seen growth in BFS side, Banking Financial Services, insurance, retail services, et cetera, and there is a slow down in, especially the transportation sector for us, but see what happens is some clients stagnate for sometime before they again continue to grow or sometimes they drop off. So, I think, the only sector I can see where that has impacted is really in the transportation and logistics sector.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Thanks. It\u2019s Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. I know some of this was covered on the prior call, but a couple of housekeeping details for Bala. Bala, did you say what the -- I know you said the net margin, but did you say what the operating margin was at Progeon Infosys BPO?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yeah. See, Progeon, the net margin is 22.4%, operating margin is 21.1%. Last quarter, the net margin was 21.3, and operating was 19.5.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Thank you. And then, when you were describing earlier about the 80 basis points from billing to 80 basis points from products, and the 50 basis point decline in G&A. I just wanted to ask about the products. When you say products, what was the -- if you can give us some color on Finacle, and how that may have impacted the product-related improvement, because it seems like Finacle had quite a strong quarter?", "Nandan Nilekani", "See, Finacle is a total bank automation product. We sell it in India and some of the Asian countries. Now we\u2019re getting into the western markets also. This quarter the Finacle revenue was $35 million as compared to $28 million last quarter. Product revenues is always -- it\u2019s a lumpy business, some quarter it will higher, some quarter it will be lower, and it's more of a license revenue. So, we have seen the Finacle revenues growing up sequentially by 27.5%, an increase of $7 million, and that had impacted positively the margin by 80 basis points, because license revenue most of the revenues flow into the margins.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Got it. And then the last thing, with regard to the billable headcount, if my calculation is right that increased as a percentage of the total professionals, the billable headcount increased pretty significantly, sequentially. And here I am just doing the numbers, but it was up -- it looks like it was up about 7% or 8% sequentially. How should we think about the seasonality related to that, and what should we anticipate is billable as a percentage of total professionals going forward? Thank you.", "Nandan Nilekani", "I think, the revenue grew by 10.1%, the volume growth was 7.4% this quarter. There was a pricing growth of 1.4%. What we believe is, the pricing environment is stable, so most of the growth could come because of volume going forward. But due to change in business mix and as some of the new customers who joined us at a higher price points, they grow faster. Both could positively impact the bill rate increase. So I think, the volume growth continues to be strong. It was 7.4% this quarter. Last quarter it was 11.2% that continues to be strong. But the revenue growth will depend on both the volume and price growth.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi, guys, and nice job this quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the demand environment, sort of areas of growth, looking into fiscal '08. Is there any particular areas that you see accelerating, and are you seeing any trends in the size and the number of the deals?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The demand continues to be robust. And we have been talking to our customers and doing some dispute settling with our customers. The feedback we get is that the budgets are going to remain stable or slightly up maybe 2% to 3%. But at the same time, there is definite indication that their spend on outsourcing, as well as offshoring is definitely on the rise. So, we expect -- we are not seeing any slowdown at this point from our customer base. Now on the deal size, what has happened to us is that the size of the deals have constantly gone up. Just to give you a flavor of the deals which we had last quarter. We have signed a deal with one of the largest hi-tech manufacturers and started work on $100 million, multi-year. We have signed a deal of about $75 million with a software provider in U.S. With a food manufacturer, we have signed a deal, $73 million, all three of them multi-year. So today we are winning deals, multiple deals of $50 million and above in a quarter. We are also being called to almost all the large deals in the market, so we have been called to deal at any size, even close to billion dollars today in the market.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great. And sort of a second question here, I was wondering, if you would talk about hiring this quarter. It usually tracks well with revenue, but it appeared to be a little bit lighter on a net basis sequentially, how should we look at the hiring this quarter especially in reference to sort of future revenue growth? Is this an affect of having ramped up in the September quarter?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We hired 6,036 people at the gross level, and net hires is about -- 6,092, and net hires is 3,282. Our attrition, as I said, is 13.5% on a last 12-month basis for this quarter. We expect to hire another 5,000 people in the next quarter. That is quarter four for us, gross, which will make the total number of people recruited this year to about 30,000. Currently our headcount across the complete group is 69,432 people. So, that\u2019s where we are right now. And we\u2019re growing headcount at, so for example this quarter the headcount grew by about 5%, 6%. Now last quarter, we saw a significant jump in hiring because there is a seasonality to hiring. We had hired about 10,795 people last quarter, and this is because the people joining us from college, straight out of college join typically in July, August, September timeframe. That's the time when the campus hires join the company.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Thank you. And just two more quick ones. On the attrition side, can you guys give us any color on where you see that rate going, and any, maybe overall views on the labor market and supply right now?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "The attrition is happening mainly in the one to five year band -- highest in the one to three year and second highest in the three to five year band. 46% of people who leave us go to join other companies; 20% for higher studies, 10% drop out of the workforce, and this 46% has been constant for the last many quarters. What is happening is that people leave for various reasons, not necessarily because of other companies coming to India and setting up shop. If you look at the attrition data, we've 1.3% involuntary attrition over the 13.5% primarily driven by people who did not pass our training course at the end of 14 or 16 weeks of training, because we've toughened the entry norms to get into the delivery organization. And if you normalize that, the attrition is 12.2%, as against 12% the previous quarter. In terms of overall people who left us, the number of people is the same this quarter, and also the last quarter, despite having a higher number of people this quarter. Overall I would say, that attrition is a function of the market having more opportunities. We do not see any definite trend. There is a marginal increase in attrition, net of involuntary attrition, and we are fairly comfortable at this point.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Sure. And just one last question here on the BPO side. Maybe you can give us an overview of the market. Is your focus continuing -- is it primarily on non-voice work, and if so, should we see margins improve and maybe attrition decrease? And thanks, guys.", "Nandan Nilekani", "On the BPO side, as far as the market is concerned, we continue to see extremely good traction, our pipeline looks strong. We have grown. Our quarter-on-quarter growth has been in double digits through the last three quarters, and this quarter we grew by 20 plus percent. As we have seen a margin expansion this quarter, as Bala pointed out, and if you take off some of the one-off items we have, we are tracking 24 plus percent margin, which we expect to continue to maintain as we move forward. Our attrition numbers quarter-on-quarter has moved positively. We were 38.2% attrition last quarter, this quarter we have 26% attrition. So we have made significant progress on the attrition side at least on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but this is only one quarter decrease, and we need to sustain it. We believe it is very important for our business to sustain attrition at these kind of numbers or even lower, and we are working very hard towards moving in that direction.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Yes, it's Rod Bourgeois here. I wanted to ask about the CapEx budget for the year. Has there been any change from your previous estimate of $360 million to $400 million that you spoke about in the September quarter, seeing your full year CapEx plan. Just would like some color on whether that CapEx plan has been lowered?", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think, the CapEx plan for the whole year continues to be the same. We said $360 million to $400 million, and there is no change in that.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. Are you on plan or is the CapEx spending going to be more back-end loaded than you originally planned?", "Nandan Nilekani", "The CapEx plan includes some provision for purchasing land for the next campuses, particularly in Bangalore and Hyderabad. So, the purchase of land may get delayed, it won't impact our overall construction schedule. But if you remove that, rest of that construction, whatever of any size is on schedule.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. Got it. And you noted the increase in your involuntary attrition, and I am wondering if that could possibly be an indication that the quality of the incoming pool of labor might not be what it was in previous years.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "I think, it's not the quality. It's just that our standards have been toughen on very -- in a dramatic manner. The quality remains the same, because we pick among the top 20% of the college batch. It\u2019s just that the entry criteria have been stiffened up. For instance, we have a minimum requirement of 4 CGPA out of 5, which we did not have. And two, we give them only one opportunity after they finish the initial assessment to complete. If they don\u2019t complete, then they don't go through. Earlier, we had more relaxed criteria, if they do not complete, we put them through a training program for another 30, 45 days, and that could take more time. Now we give them one more opportunity to complete in 15 days, and that is it. So, we have toughened up the criteria to ensure that people take this much more seriously than earlier, and if they don't, they do not continue and that's the only thing. We have not seen any fall in stand of the people coming in.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Got it. But, can you specify what\u2019s driving your increased criteria? I mean is there a reason why you\u2019ve taken your criteria up?", "Nandan Nilekani", "We\u2019ve taken the criteria up to make sure that as we spread our intake across many more colleges, people do not take our training program in an easy manner. What we\u2019ve found in the previous year was that beware of people who are not stretching themselves to learn as much as they could. They were just coasting through in the secure knowledge that is okay to coast through, and there were no strict penalties that don\u2019t do very well because of lack of effort. So, we put in a strict penalty to say that, you need to have minimum criteria to get through, if you don\u2019t, you may not continue. And that\u2019s the only reason to ensure that the training becomes really effective and people take it very, very seriously.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay, great. That makes perfect sense. And if I assume the license revenue spike that you received in the quarter, which also helped margins 80 basis points, if I assume that was a \u201clumpy event\u201d and is not going to be a recurring event, then you need other levers moving into next quarter, particularly if you have a surprise like the rupee moving against you again. So, can you give us some specificity on what positive margin leverage you have remaining for the March quarter, if you need to pull those levers more aggressively for an unexpected event?", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think we spoke about several levers in the past. One is onsite/offshore mix, second is the utilization rate, third is a G&A scale benefit, and fourth is the increase in blended per capita revenues. So, we had to use one of these levers or some of these levers at some point of time to make sure the margins are maintained. Our guidance factors in the stable margin except for the rupee for next quarter because we assume the currency rate of 44.11 for next quarter, whereas in December quarter the average rate was 44.53. So, we have to use some of these levers to make sure that impact is minimal.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. But I guess the question I would have on that is offsite mix and per capita revenues are levers if you have an unexpected surprise, can you really affect offsite mix? Is that a controllable lever that you can decide to pull in a given quarter? Or is that something that\u2019s really just a function of the demand that happens to be available and it\u2019s harder to control that? And I would assume offsite mix and per capita revenues are levers that are hard to control at your discretion, is that accurate or not?", "Nandan Nilekani", "I think it depends on the service mix. For example, if testing grows faster, most of it is offshore, BPO grows faster, most of it is offshore. But to some extent it\u2019s decided even by the business mix. So, if we are able to grow some of the high offshore revenue segments like testing our BPO, offshore could increase.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Right. But I guess as an example, if the rupee surprisingly appreciated in a material way tomorrow, do you have the ability to decide to increase your revenue content in segments that better leverage offsite? Can you make that decision into a quarter and act on it?", "Nandan Nilekani", "I think the rupee behaved irrational in the last week of the quarter, we can\u2019t do it. If it happens in the beginning of the quarter probably we could focus more on segments where we want to grow. So, I am trying to change some of the mix, but it\u2019s not totally in our hands, it also depends on the market demand environment. But I think we also have other levers, as I told you, we have the SG&A benefit, we have the utilization rates, so we can use some of the lever stocks that impact.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. And one final question, this has been very helpful. Within G&A, I mean what are the specific things you could do into a quarter on G&A? I mean I guess, cutting variable comp is a lever, are there others besides that that are pretty big buckets of room for cutting if needed?", "Nandan Nilekani", "I think on the G&A side, one of the variable salaries, and some of that costs are discretionary that we can cut down. And also we keep fixed vigil on kind of G&A expense we want to spend. So, even though the absolute numbers may increase slightly, it may not increase in proportion to revenues. That\u2019s why we get the scale benefits. So, some of the discretionary cost, may be around 30, 40 basis points, you can squeeze in the G&A side.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Got it, very clear. All right, thanks guys very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning guys. I just wanted to check on a couple of quick things. First of all, the kind of visibility that you guys have on the product side, can you talk a little bit about it, if something this is going to be a much more lumpy business if it stays at this percentage of your business given the software nature of the sales, is that correct?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Product, yes is lumpy, Bala had indicated that it will be lumpy. But it\u2019s a small part of our business, about 4% of our business comes from product revenue. And lead times for closure are longer and -- we have a smaller base to work on. So, this quarter, we\u2019ve had a positive benefit from that, but it is lumpy.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And then certain comments overnight regarding appetite for acquisitions in Europe, can you talk a little bit about what that was intended to reference?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We have always said that we are open for acquisitions. We will look at acquisitions to fill a gap in our services mix to grow faster in a market where organic growth will be challenging, for example, in a non-English speaking market like Germany, France, Japan et cetera and so in that context, Europe -- in Europe, where we can look at an acquisition. We'll also look at acquisitions to look at the faster growth in a particular industry vertical or an entirely new vertical. Given that, integration is the biggest challenge, making it work is the biggest challenge, and the industry data shows that only maybe 15% to 20% of acquisitions give the value or the benefit which was intended to be given and/or you derive benefit from that. We are careful in selecting the companies. We are careful in what we are willing to pay and we are careful about the ability to integrate. We need to have clear plans for integration, roles, and responsibilities. Especially, the overlap is significant. We need to figure out who stays, who does what, and where the work gets done because our model requires a lot of people to be stationed in locations like India and offshore locations et cetera. So there are some challenges and that\u2019s the reason why we have been very careful about acquisitions. We have done one in Australia. We have done smaller one for our product group where they needed certain modules for filling the portfolio for the product, and we did some acquisitions there, but we are open at any point of time. We are in discussions with some companies, some investment banks et cetera, only if it fructifies we can, of course, talk about it, or show that we have done one more.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. And then finally for me on the wage increases, as we begin to look through fiscal year 2008, what are sort of the preliminary plans or view points for affecting another wage increase as we head in fiscal -- the next fiscal year?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "In the last several years, if you look at what has happened in India, wage increases have been in the range of 13% to 15%. At this point, we believe that is the range we are looking at for next year also. And that\u2019s something, which we have factored into our model. About 70% of the recruitment happens at the entry level at the bottom of the pyramid, for -- where we look at the distribution of people. And as the year goes, this 13% to 15% actually reduces to maybe about 5%, 6% because the pyramid starts broadening at the bottom as the year progresses. And, so the total impact is actually much lower than the 13% to 15%.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. And is this modest change? I thought last quarter you guys were talking about possibly even going as high as 20% on the offshore wage increases. Are you looking at a slightly reduced number now, or maybe -- maybe I am mistaking you guys to somebody else?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "See, the 13% to 15% is the average across the company.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Now, what we do is, we do targeted increase where the attrition is high. Mohan talked about attrition being higher at the two to five year experience level. So, we can do targeted increase at certain levels, and as I've said that the entry level is much lower and that\u2019s how the pyramid effect comes in.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Grossman of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks. I am looking at perhaps, Bala, you can or Kris breakout the improvement and realization between pricing and mix?", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think, the volume growth had been 7.4%, 6.1% onsite, 8% offshore. So, on a blended basis volumes grew by 7.4%. The per capita revenue went up by 1.4%, 1.9% onsite, 1.7% offshore. Overall, revenue growth was 10.1%.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Right. I guess, I was thinking more in terms of the per capita revenue, if you could, it looks like you grew, like you said, about 0.5 sequentially and 4% or 5% year-over-year. And I am wondering is there anyway to isolate how much of that is pricing versus mix?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, it's difficult, it's a mix of everything. You have some new customers coming at higher price point because mix is changing some of the high bill rate services like package implementation consulting. They are growing faster, it's a blend of everything, it's difficult to break it up.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Is there anyway to say both --", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "I think, it's quite complex actually because you have to look at the year in which the customer was added, and then you have to look at the different services. You have to look at onsite, offshore. It's fairly complicated because of that.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And I guess getting back to the unit growth number, I think, Bala, there were couple of fewer work days, was that two in the quarter versus the prior quarter? And I guess, I have two questions in that context, is that essentially the change in sequential unit growth from the past couple of quarters to the December quarter? And then secondly, can you give us an idea, do we face that same dynamic in the March quarter, or are you going to be -- are you flattish in terms of number of work days March versus December?", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think, the number of working days in December quarter was two days less. That is one of the reasons why the growth has been slower. In March quarter, the working days is slightly higher, but March quarter is always a soft quarter for us, because the customers finalize the budgets, and it takes time for them to spend. So that is a reason, we have given a guidance of 4.9% growth in March. Other than that, I don\u2019t see any other reason.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then talking a little bit just about the pipeline, and I don\u2019t know if that was Shibu earlier on the call that he was making some comments. But if you look at the pipeline, the larger deals are these characterized more by stand-alone deals or are these typically components of larger outsourcing deals, which are segregating out components which can be then offshore?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The deals which I talked about, the ones which I mentioned in my remarks, they were all stand-alone deals. They were not segregations. We also pursue deals of size ranging from $100 million to $1 billion, and some of them we do end up getting part of the deal, and we probably have about 5 to 6 of those deals in progress. But they are long incubation deals. It takes anywhere from nine months to a year for closure. But at the same time, the deals I mentioned and the deals I mentioned as happening every quarter, many of them are stand-alone deals.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And just one last question on the\u2026", "V. Balakrishnan", "And for the guidance, we\u2019re not factoring what we consider as the mega-deals, which are $100 million and above.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And how many fit that category?", "V. Balakrishnan", "At this point probably we have five to six in that category, but the point is these are long incubation deals, it takes anywhere from nine months to 12 months.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then just getting back to the BPO business for a while, that business, it\u2019s been growing in kind of mid single to low double digit growth rates sequentially for several quarters, and it spiked up this year. Is that -- is there something fundamentally going on in the BPO business on a secular basis or just recognition in the marketplace that this could be done or more focused by Infosys, any color you can give us to the -- I guess, to the acceleration of sequential growth over the last two quarters?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Sorry. No, I don\u2019t think there is, the BPO market has been, in terms of overall demand has been quite good. So, it is not that suddenly there is a big change in the BPO market, which has led to this continued growth. We have been growing quite rapidly since we were set up five years back. But what you are definitely seeing is that our number of clients, there must be increased number of clients, and as you see growth in each of those clients, you can track a much higher growth than before. So, we are continuing to sign more clients, and each of those clients as they continue to add to the growth rate, you\u2019ll see that the double digit kind of growth rate is coming back. I mean, our clients are seeing value in working with us. We are able to demonstrate to them how we\u2019re adding value on a year-to-year basis and that\u2019s why we have seen continued growth in each of our BPO clients we are working with. And as we sign more clients, and normally if we sign a client this year, you\u2019ll see the real impact of the growth from that client coming only after 12 months to 18 months.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Price of Stifel Nicolaus.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Can you hear me? Hello. Can you hear me, okay?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Your line is open.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. I apologize, a little phone issue there. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I still do have a couple more, just going back to the prior question on talking about the large deals. Has there been any change to your view of what you will and wont be willing to pursue, I know Infosys historically has seemed to be a little bit more hesitant in pursuing larger deals that may involve higher risk, particularly to the margin side, taking over a large amount of people, certainly taking over any meaningful assets. Can you just tell us where your view stands right now? What are the characteristics of the larger deals that you\u2019re looking at now?", "Nandan Nilekani", "So, not much change in our philosophy here. We want to take these deals at reasonable prices and reasonable margins. We want to make sure that we are able to execute well, which means that under the global delivery model typically [telling them] the expertise is delivered offshore. So, if you takeover a significant number of employees, then we will be challenged to figure out what to do with them. So, that\u2019s why we are reluctant to take over significant number of employees, 20%, 30% of employees we can take over or beyond that, and we need to figure out what to do. It would be better, if the client can do the restructuring, given that they want to get the benefit of the global delivery model, and then we can work with them to takeover the work, etcetera. So that's the philosophy of the company, and it continues to be the philosophy.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "To what extent are you willing to enter in the longer-term deals that are going to be margin dilutive, and kind of over what timeframe? I mean, if you get hit for a couple of quarters, and to the extent, you can elaborate on what magnitude might be tolerable versus -- I mean, how far will you go in that regard and what would you not take on?", "Nandan Nilekani", "So, what we do is when a large deal comes in, our finance department does a modeling exercise to figure out what will be the impact on our margins, short-term, long-term, etcetera. And if we are able to absorb that, and sometimes we are able to absorb that because there is some other business, which is coming at a higher margin, etcetera. Then we proceed. So that's something we do on a deal by deal basis and take decisions based on what is the current situation at that point.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Wage inflation, and just on the -- one more thing on the larger deals, you mentioned five to six deals that you are looking at right now that are fairly sizeable. Can you talk about a timeframe that they maybe [decisioned], I am assuming those would be likely fiscal '08 deals, but what if it's not, and maybe where within the year, earlier or later?", "Nandan Nilekani", "We have not included these in our guidance precisely because it's a one or a zero in a timeframe that long. And we don't want to give you a calendar of -- these are the deals, these are when it is going to be potentially signed etcetera, because we don't know. We have no control over this, and we have -- that\u2019s why we have not included it in our guidance also.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Going back also to some of the questions on wage inflation, noting that you leveraged the pyramid to dilute the wage inflation that you experienced on a blended basis, we did see -- or have started to see, I guess, some wage inflation at the entry level, I guess, actually those starting in fiscal '08. Do you think that you might need to do this again? Can you just talk about maybe the entry level environment from that perspective, are there other -- beyond even this industry, are there other industries or other players within the industry that might be influencing demand for people at the entry level, that might cause you to have to up the entry level wages materially?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Well, I think, the entry level wages in the country are being influenced by only two industries: the IT industry, and the financial services industry. The financial service industry this year will hire maybe about 75,000 to 100,000 people and the IT industry about 380,000 people. These two are driving up the demand for entry level people, and the IT industry is hiring the largest number of people. You get the best of the crop. But obviously, the competition is for the best of the best. And here the financial services could offer a slightly higher wage to grab them. And certainly the glamour quotient of financial service industry is getting higher, because of investment banking and [absurd] incomes that they earn. As far as entry wages go, we raised them from 240,000 rupees a year to 270,000 rupees a year for the next year, and it could go up by maybe 10% a year after that, and this 10% is factored into that 13% to 15% compensation that we talk about for the entire band. So, if you pay a 10% increase at entry level, the mid level you could possibly afford to pay slightly more at critical areas to make sure that it will become more attractive. But definitely going forward for the rest of industry in this country, it is going to become very-very challenging to get more and more people in. Right now the retail industry is hiring, they are not able to get people. The construction industry is not able to get people because all the engineers want to join IT and the manufacturing industries couldn\u2019t find it more difficult. What will happen in India in the next three or four years, is what we call right-skilling. Indian industry has traditionally been a place, where we have taken over-qualified people to do more mundane work. I think, in the next two or three years most companies will start identifying people for the right time and not getting over-qualified people to do work. And that I think will help to stem this balance in a particular way. For instance, we have about 1,700 graduates within Infosys, and the services business would do a part of the work in one or two verticals, and that number is becoming slightly larger over the years. So in this way right-skilling will be the solution for the whole industry, and as far as we are concerned we are sure we'll be at the top of the heap.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And so the 10% that you discussed remind me last year you made, what was -- was it a 20% bump for those entering in fiscal '08?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No. I am not saying that. What I am saying is --", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "No. I am sorry. You gave that the 240 or 270, I apologize. So, the 10% bump that you just referenced that could come after that, that would be for those coming in, in fiscal '09?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yeah.", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And last question on just going back to Finacle. I have seen some articles and some comments that you have made and you discussed it a little bit here that you are looking to expand your client base for the Finacle product outside of India with larger financial -- global financial institutions. Can you talk a little bit more about where that stands in terms of opportunity pipeline, and your plans in fiscal 08? I mean, just maybe some more around the goals of what you might like this segment, small as it is, obviously it does have a -- can have a meaningful impact. What are your goals for this segment might be looking into fiscal '08? I mean mid -- upper single digit as a percent of revenue or how many clients maybe would you think would be a reasonable assumption by the end of fiscal '08 and anything along those lines?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, we would like Finacle to grow faster than the rest of the business on a related basis. That would be a very nice goal. And as far as the price line is concerned, we have said earlier today that the pipeline is stronger in the last quarter, the December quarter than the previous quarter. We\u2019ve seen opening in Europe. We have seen openings in Eastern Europe and in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia has opened up large banks that are now seeing a need for change the core banking. We already got a very large bank headquartered in Singapore and we are seeing an increase in Russia and Eastern Europe and some fraction in Western Europe. So, we are seeing the first studyings of the need for the Western banks in Europe to open up and look at change. As far as the US is concerned, our viewers is concerned, the functionality that we have needs to be improved upon to meet the requirements of the US that were not right there at this point of time.", "Nandan Nilekani", "Okay. I think with this, we have come to the end of our call and I would like to thank each and everyone of you for coming on this call and asking us questions. We are always there to answer any questions and if you have any further questions, we would be happy to have email from you to Shekhar Narayanan, Sandeep Mahindroo, and V. Bala, our CFO. So we will be happy to answer any questions. And thank you everyone and see you same time next quarter. Thank you. Good night. Good morning. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Infosys Technologies' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2007 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). ", "Mr. Mahindroo, you may begin your conference. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning and welcome everyone to this conference call to discuss Infosys' financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2007. This is Sandeep here from the Investor Relations team in the US. ", "Before we start, I would like to apologize for starting the call a bit late. ", "Joining us today in this conference call are CEO and MD, Mr. Nandan Nilekani; President, COO and Joint MD, Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management. ", "We'll start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter and the year, followed by the outlook for Q1 and fiscal 2008. After that, we'll open up the discussion for the Q&A. ", "Before I pass it on to the Infosys management, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov. ", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. Nilekani. ", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thank you, Sandeep. First of all, I would like to apologize for the slight delay in starting, because we really have been having back to back meetings and engagements today. So, I am really sorry about that. ", "Let me start by briefly mentioning the senior management changes, which are going to come into effect from June 22. Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan will assume the role of CEO and Managing Director form June 22. Mr. Shibulal will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer of the company. And I will become Co-Chairman of the Board. All this will be after the AGM on June 22. ", "We think that this will lay the stage for the organizational structure to take this company forward in the coming years to come. ", "Now for the fiscal year 2007. We had revenues of $3.1 billion, which on a year-to-year basis is a growth of 44%. And as we look forward, we are looking at a growth of between 28% to 30% in dollar terms, and we believe that we will reach a revenue of $4 billion for fiscal '08, out of which the profit will be $1 billion. ", "While there has been a talk about slowdown and all those things, we believe that the global IT service industry continues to show a strong growth. We think that there continues to be exciting opportunities for firms like Infosys, and Infosys thanks to its long-term investment in building a key pole position in this industry is well positioned to take advantage of these changes. ", "Now, the important thing to note is that we are seeing very high-quality growth. All our growth has been organic. And we have seen growth not only in rest of the world, including Australia, Europe, and we have also seen very strong growth in our consulting, engineering services, BPO and package implementation. ", "And one of the areas where there has been remarkable growth is in telecom, where we have grown sequentially by 25%. And even the BFSI space, which is seen by many people as having slowed down, had grown sequentially this quarter by 0.7%. ", "Now, this quarter our operating margin dropped by 100 basis points. This is primarily on account of rupee appreciation. But as we look forward, we have given guidance where we expect the profitability to be maintained at the same percentage level next year. ", "However, we've had a dilution of our shareholding by virtue of 13 million shares being exercised by employees in the last quarter of this financial year, which has had an impact of about 3% on our total issued share capital. The EPS for next year will be around a little lower than the growth in revenues terms. ", "We also had a look at the entire opportunity. We have looked at the large opportunities across the customers, and we believe that our investments are bearing fruit as we go forward. ", "I think we've been saying for several years now that we have built a fundamentally receptive business model that we have invested in building a unique position. And I think all the things are paying off. And we have gone from a $1 billion in 2004 to $2 billion in 2006 to $3 billion this year, and we expect to cross $4 billion next year. ", "With this, I'll request to my colleague, Kris, to go into some of the other details of our performance this quarter. Kris? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks, Nandan and good evening to everyone of you. Let me give you some more highlights of the growth. The top 10 customers have been sequentially growing by double-digits over the four quarters. This quarter, the top 10 customers grew 15.5%. ", "It clearly shows that the growth is there. It shows that customers are clearly leveraging offshore much more than ever before. There is a fundamental transformation, which leverages the opportunities for sourcing around the world. And this is primarily driving some of the growth we are seeing today. ", "Nandan talked about growth in the telecom sector. If I look at the different sectors, we can clearly see that on an annual basis, there are multiple sectors which have been growing for us. Banking and financial services grew 49% for the year. Manufacturing grew 39%, retailing 42%, telecom 68%, et cetera. So, there are multiple sectors which are growing. ", "From a geography perspective, we have been investing in Europe and that is yielding results. Europe grew 54% for the year. ", "Coming back to the trend, we have $275 million relationships. We have three clients contributing more than $100 million, and one client contributing more than $200 million. 34 clients, who are new clients, were added this quarter. Repeat business continues to be high at 93% and the DSOs are well under control. ", "So, overall on the client side, we are making sure that there is opportunity to grow. ", "From an employee perspective, we have added 5,992 employees, and we are looking to add another 24,500 employees for the coming year. ", "Attrition is slightly up 13.5% to 13.7%, but if you exclude involuntary attrition it is actually flat. And we are targeting where the challenges are and making sure that we adjust some utilization, excluding trainees to 74%. So, this allows us to take advantage of any business opportunity, which comes in our way in the future where we can accelerate growth. ", "This is also factored into our guidance and this is one of the ways we are offsetting some of the compensation increases and things like that. ", "With this, I am going to handover to Bala to talk more about the financial numbers. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "This has been a very good quarter. Our revenues were $863 million, which sequentially went up by 5.1%. For the full year, the revenues went up by 44% to $3 billion. ", "We have seen the gross margin coming down slightly this quarter as compared to December quarter. It's mainly because of rupee. Rupee has appreciated by 1.8%. The average rupee dollar rate was 44.53 in December quarter compared to 43.75 this quarter. That had an impact on the gross margin and also operating margin. ", "SG&A was similar. There is no big change. On the operating margins, the margins came down by 1.1 percentage point, mainly because of rupee. And non-operating income went up slightly because we have additional investable surplus and also the yield went up. The average yield was 7% in December quarter on the investable surplus, which went up to 10% this quarter. That has resulted in additional non-operating income. ", "Provision for tax came down during this quarter, mainly because of tax reversal of $29 million, which pertains to tax provisions that we\u2019ve made in the earlier year for some of our tax obligation in both the jurisdictions. ", "And in some of those cases, the assessments are over. So we have to reverse the provisions we made in excess of the liability and in one of the jurisdiction the limitation period is over. So, it is a one-time event. Excluding that, the top-line growth and the bottom-line growth is almost same. ", "We gave a guidance of $0.40. Our actual EPS for March quarter was $0.46. If we exclude the one-time tax reversal of $0.05, our actual EPS is $0.41. ", "So net-net it has been a good quarter. We have seen the top 10 clients growing at 15.5% sequentially. We have seen good volume growth. Onsite volumes went up by 4%, offshore went up by 3.4% sequentially, and total went up by 3.6%. ", "We have seen good increase in per capita revenues. Our onsite per capita revenues went up sequentially by 1.7%, offshore went up by 1.4% and blended went up by 1.7%. ", "Overall, for the whole year, we have seen the blended per capita revenue growing by something around 4.9%. ", "If you look at the subsidiaries, most of the subsidiaries have done well as per plan. Our Infosys BPO had a revenue of $147 million with net income of 21%. Infosys Australia did $100 million in revenues, with a 16% net income. ", "Infosys Consulting had $47 million of revenue with a net loss of $25 million. They are still in the investment phase. But if you look at Infosys Consulting plus the slowdown work we did in the offshore global delivery model, they are still making profits with standalone losses. Infosys China had $13 million of revenue with a $6 million loss. ", "Coming to guidance, our guidance for next year is the growth in revenues of 28% to 30%. We are not factoring any increase in per capita revenue in our guidance. We are not factoring any big deals. We had guided for an EPS growth of 26% to 28%, excluding the one-time tax reversal that we made in the March quarter of fiscal 2007. The difference in the growth is mainly due to dilution. ", "We have seen 13 million shares getting exercised in the March quarter, because we are getting into a new FBT regime from April where most of the employees have exercised the stock ahead of the new regime. We had seen something around 20 million shares exercised in fiscal '07. ", "Our outstanding options, as of March 31, is something around 4 million options; 2.1 million under our 1998 ADR plan and another 1.9 million under our 1999 Rupee plan. ", "So, most of the dilution has happened this year and the growth accelerated because of the new tax regime. Going forward, we believe that our effective tax rate could be within the range of 11% to 12%. ", "In the current quarter that is March quarter, the effective tax rate went up to 12.9%, mainly because of the higher non-operating income. We believe that it will be within the range even for next year. ", "I think overall what we are saying is we are bullish about the market, given that our guidance factors in 28% to 30% growth in dollar terms. We are not seeing any dilution in margins for next year. We are increasing the offshore wages by somewhere between 13% to 15% and onsite wages for people outside India by 5% to 6%. ", "Overall, the impact on the margins because of the wage increases is something around 300 basis points, and we are assuming the rupee/dollar rate at 43.10. The average for fiscal '07 was 45. So, that could have an impact of something around 150 to 160 basis points on the margin. ", "We are planning to offset that by higher utilization. We are ending the fiscal '07 with utilization of 74%. We\u2019ve always said that we are comfortable with the high 70s kind of utilization. So, some improvement will come from utilization. We believe that we can get some scale benefits from SG&A, and the subsidiary losses will be less next year. ", "So, overall, we believe that we will be able to maintain the margins in spite of absorbing the wage increase and the rupee impact for next year. ", "With this, I\u2019ll conclude my presentation. And we can throw the floor open for questions now. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions.) Your first question comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein ", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Hi guys. I just wanted to inquire about the strategy of increasing the utilization rate over the next year in order to benefit margins. A year ago, we had the discussion about needing to lower utilization in order to create a bigger bench of talent in order to maximize revenue growth opportunities. And I am wondering if the plan to increase utilization reflects any change in that strategy at all? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "This is Shibulal. If you look back at the conversation, that's exactly what we have done. We are very comfortable with the utilization in high 70s. Our utilization this quarter is actually in the low 70s. So, there is definite room for improvement in the utilization and then we will be very comfortable, number one. ", "Number two, as the utilization goes up we have the ability to recruit people just in time, by which we can actually manage the utilization at whatever level we need. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Yeah. Is there is something that has happened in the market that would suggest that maintaining a bigger bench of talent is less important this year than it would have been a year ago in order to have people available when clients say they need people on a new deal? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, a higher utilization actually creates stress within the system because it's like having a manufacturing plant and you cannot have people come just in time all the time. So, it made sense for us to have some amount of strategic bench, especially when you are bidding for large deals. And when large deals come into picture, there is one-time investment of people acquired. And today, on an average, every quarter we close some large deals, some multimillion dollar multiyear deal gets closed in every quarter. ", "So, it was important for us to build a strategic bench. At the same time, at this point in time, we have the fleet transferring too in the bench without impacting the business -- including the utilization, without impacting the business. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Right. And help us a little bit with the debate that is out there in the market. There is some who argue that the slowing US economy could actually help demand. There are arguments that demand for your business is countercyclical. Do you subscribe to that view? Or is there any risk of the slowing US economy affecting the demand for your services? ", "Nandan Nilekani", "Well, I think they have been saying for some time now that there is a natural edge in our business. What happens in our businesses is that when the economy is booming and companies are increasing the spend on the technology then we become a natural choice to have that increased spend upon. ", "On the other hand, when economies are not growing and companies are under pressure to become more efficient, to become more competitive, and to reduce costs, then they are looking for the best partners in the world to do the reinventing on themselves. They need to do to be more effective and competitive. And that's where also we come into play. And therefore, in some sense, our business is able to do well both in times of stress as well as in times of economic growth. ", "I think, particularly, this is becoming all the more relevant because we think that most of our customers are facing enormous challenges in the way they reengineer themselves in a flat world. ", "We think that they will have to look at how they sell, where they sell, whom they sell, what they sell, at what price they sell, where they produce it and where they service it from. So, all these things are being redesigned. And I think our knowledge and intellectual capital in helping our customers' transform is becoming increasingly valuable and is one of the sources for moving on demand that we are seeing. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Okay. Now, that's well said. And can you just comment, in the last year you guided to 28% to 30% revenue growth initially and ended up reporting 44% for the year, which is pretty impressive. Would you say that your guidance this year is as conservative as it was in the year-ago period? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "No. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Is there any way to sort of help us to maintain the difference in conservatives in this year versus last year? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, I think the fact that the guidance this year is coincidentally the same as the guidance last year. I don\u2019t think from that you can automatically deduce that the growth this year will be the same as last year. I don't think the two are related. And I think last year we had the fortunate benefit of buoyancy right from day one and we are able to build the company. And I think Mohan wants to add some more. ", "Mohan Pai", "Our guidance is based upon a snapshot at a particular point of time. Even last year, when you gave the 30% guidance, it was a snapshot at that point of time. We don't know about future events. As of date, our guidance is based upon all the information and our reading of the marketplace at this point of time. So, guidance is only a snapshot. So, as you go along, we'll know how the market pans out. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "And what we do is that, as we said, we have a utilization of 74%. And if there are opportunities, then we are able to take advantages of those opportunities, and that's where the acceleration happens. So, we are prepared. We are ready. We keep a strategic bench. And then, if the opportunity presents itself, we will grow fast. But as we look towards the future, as we stand where we are today, we are saying that we will grow 28% to 30%. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Hey, thanks. Going back to your remark on the financial services vertical that grew -- I don't know, roughly 1% sequentially, it\u2019s still a slowdown sequentially. Is there anything you can say just to give us some sort of a color that we are not really seeing a slowdown that some people actually are worried about the financial services sector at this point? I think this is a second consecutive quarter where we are seeing that slowdown. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We are not seeing any slowdown. Quarter-by-quarter, there may be some slight slowdown in a particular industry vertical. It's really not a slowdown. If you look at the last 12 months, the financial services sector has grown by 49%, whereas the company grew by 44%. So, it is actually doing reasonably well for the company. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Okay. So, we shouldn't read anything into it. And then, growth from your non-top 10 clients, it is also sequentially or -- I don't know, flat. And typically, the growth is pretty well between your top 10 and non-top 10. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We have initiatives to broaden our exposure within a client by cross-selling the different services. Again, I want to say that quarter-by-quarter, there will be differences. But when you look at the trend, when you look at how things are happening, for example, if you look at the growth this year. If you look at the breadth of that growth in terms of different industry segments, in terms of the different customers, we have more million dollar relationships now than when we started the year. We have more $10 million relationships and more $100 million relationships. So, across the board, we have seen growth. ", "When you look at the service footprint, we have seen that all the services are growing, especially those services, which we started in the last three, four years, BPO, Infrastructure Management, Independent Validation Services, Consulting, they are showing good growth. ", "Then when we look at geography, we are proactively investing in Europe that is showing results. We are investing in Australia that is showing results. So, we are seeing broad-based growth, and that is what has given us the confidence to say that there is momentum. ", "Now, a particular sector, a particular customer may show differences in growth rates in a particular quarter. But you have to look at the overall direction and how broad-based this growth is and that's what has given us the confidence. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Okay. And the third and final question, just for Bala. I think you lost about $30 million from both China and North American Consulting. I think, I don't remember, if it was for the quarter or for the year, maybe you can clarify the exact losses? And then, what is your expectation for fiscal '08 in terms of China and North American Consulting? Thanks. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "In China, we had factored in a loss of $2 million in the March quarter, Consulting made a loss of $11 million in the March quarter. For the full year, Consulting loss was $25 million and China was $6.5 million. Going forward, next year, our guidance factors a lower loss for Infosys Consulting. We are factoring a loss of something around $4 million for Consulting and same amount of loss for China, because both the companies are still in the investment phase. ", "For Consulting, the losses could come down in the near future if we can break even on a standalone basis. But as I said earlier, we should not look at Infosys Consulting on a standalone business. We have to look at the slowdown work and the flow-through work that comes at a superior margin. So overall, they are still making money, but on a standalone basis they are making losses. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Great, thanks for your clarification. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Good evening guys. My question is, first of all, just to get the March quarter sort of behind us at this point. Why was the volume growth so low in the March quarter? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "We have had three quarters of good growth. Now, this is as per the guidance, which we gave. So this is what we had factored in, nothing extra kicked in, and so we have this growth at this point. So, this is as per guidance. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Your volume growth of 4% is consistent with what you expected for the quarter. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yeah, that's the guidance which we gave at the beginning of the quarter. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, yeah typically we see a little bit of upside. So I think when you look at the utilization trends coming down in the quarter and the net hiring being about in line with not a lot of upside. The pushback I think right now is going to be more around the lines of \u201cis this driven by you guys trying to manage your business or is this driven by clients who are pushing back, pushing out may be seasonality.\u201d So, can you just sort of provide may be a little bit of color around that? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "See, our third and fourth quarter have been slow quarters for us and those are the quarters where we start building up a bench for the future. So, yes there is some seasonality and we try to manage that. Sometimes, we get an extra kick through a particular client or through a particular deal and it accelerates. But this quarter was just as we thought it would be and nothing different. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then the top client this quarter, was it the same top client last quarter? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Same client, okay. And what drove the kind of acceleration in that client? Was there a major project, a major conversion? Can you just maybe, without talking about the client itself, just the specifics on the work that would drive such a material acceleration from quarter-to-quarter? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We are trying to cross sell our services and do everything as plan, and in this case we were successful in coming out with the right kind of services for this client, and that's why they grew. We have been investing and broadening our relationship, investing in our relationships team, in order to make sure that they are able to handle much larger relationships and recruiting the right kind of people who can handle relationships at high level. ", "We have been building CEO and Board level relationships with many of our clients. So, there are many things which we are doing, which gives the client the comfort. We have the right mix of services, so that they can buy and grow the business. And of course, we have the execution capability today to scale-up rapidly. ", "We have the bench which is required again to scale-up rapidly. There are many things which we have done, which allows us to grow relationships, our brand equity, and the perception of risk. All those factors actually play a role in growing an account. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then may be switch gears over to Bala. Bala, when you said that you expect the margins to be basically flat year-over-year, are you talking about an EBIT margin or EBITDA margin in U.S. GAAP? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "I am talking about the operating margins. We always said, we should be able to maintain the operating margins within a narrow band. The only joker in the pack is the currency rate. What you are saying now is even though we factored in some kind of a rupee appreciation in next year\u2019s guidance, we should be able to absorb that and still maintain the margins within a narrow band for next year also. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Narrow band, okay. So, you are talking about EBIT then, right? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, got it. And then in the comments that you made you suggested that you would get some benefit from utilization, get some benefit from SG&A. What about pricing? What's your pricing assumption for fiscal year '08? ", "Nandan Nilekani", "Yeah. On the pricing, we are assuming the price to remain flat for the whole of next year. It\u2019s a tradition we follow year-on-year. We don't assume any price increases in the guidance and that continues. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "If you look at the pricing over the last couple of quarters, it's been going up. Your comments on pricing suggest that your clients are coming on at higher rates. Why is there such a conservative posture on pricing? ", "Nandan Nilekani", "No, we always do it, even in last year when we started the year. And we gave a guidance of 28% to 30%. We are not factored in the guidance, as we are not factored in the price increase because it depends on a lot of things, the kind of business mix we have, kind of customers we have, and the kind of growth we see from the new customers. It's very difficult to predict in the beginning of the year. So, normally we don't factor in any price increase in our guidance. And if it comes, it will be on top of what we guided. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks. When you look at in terms of the guidance, can you provide some insight into relative growth by segment between the BPO segment, the product segment and the services segment? ", "Nandan Nilekani", "The guidance for BPO is $217 million compared to $147 million this year. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And products and services? ", "Nandan Nilekani", "We have assumed revenue from products about $145 million. And the rest of course, are in other services. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And looking at, I guess this is coming out from the other question, just not to the level of point. But it looks like the combination of sequential unit growth utilization and hiring, it just looks like there has been a little bit of change in the profile of the growth rate of the services business. I know you made some comments about that. But is there anything fundamentally that you are seeing in the market? Or is it in your scale? Or is it anything else that you can point to help us better us better understand that dynamic? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Not really. The only difference is we are seeing larger deals and our own relationship with our clients are growing. And I think that is part of the growth itself. We are a much larger company today. The perception of risk, the perception of the clients about the company is changing. That's the only thing I can think of. ", "The rest are in terms of new services growing faster, new markets growing faster and the investments. Those are the kind of things. But the only difference I would say is the scale is much larger. The comfort is much better and risk perception is reduced. That's all. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And just looking at the pricing trends. Obviously they have been a fairly robust for the last several quarters. Is any of the pricing increase that you are seeing coming from the change in the rupee or other factors that are driving prices, like wages etcetera? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "No. I think the pricing and currency is not directly related. It is indirectly related in the sense that we can use that as a factor when we negotiate with our clients saying that the costs are going up. But it is a negotiated price. Even though in the contracts, we have certain clauses, which can be triggered. ", "The cost of the long-term nature of our relationship with our clients is always a negotiated price. This allows us to go back to our client and negotiate, renegotiate. When the time comes for the negotiation, we don't do out of term negotiation, etcetera, because we want to build the long-term relationship with our client. That's the most important thing. ", "There is a lot of volatility and we don't want to keep going back and forth with our clients saying that you need to change the pricing because currency is fluctuating. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "If you look at the per capita revenues last quarter, it went up on a blended basis by 1.7%. And if you look at the segment information, Europe is almost same. Last quarter it was 26.8%, and in March quarter it was 26.6%. So, most of the price increases we have seen in the last quarter mainly came from multiple things like business mix, new customers growing faster, and some other customers valuating some kind of a price increase. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And Bala what was the hedging gain in the quarter? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "As of March end, we have a hedging position of $470 million. In last quarter, we had something around $360 million. In the March quarter, our translation impact has almost netted off the impact we have seen on the currency. So net-net on the non-operating income side, the impact due to currency is very minimal. We believe that we have sufficient hedges at this point of time. Our policy always was to cover our next two quarters\u2019 net inflow and we'll continue to do that. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "So the hedging gain and the non-operating income offset the impact on the gross margins from that side? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yeah on the non-operating side, we have two impacts. One is your currency impact and second is the translation because we have certain foreign currency assets sitting in the balance sheet, if need to be mark-to-market how the currency rate is as of the period-end. ", "So in March quarter, typically the translation benefits wouldn't offset the currency impact. So net-net, we are not seeing any big impact on the non-operating income because of currency. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Oh, I see. And that was for the March quarter? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yeah. And then just finally, I think I heard you say that you expect your tax rate to be roughly 12% next year, is that correct? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "See, in December quarter, the effective tax rate was something around 11.7%. It went up to 12.9% in March quarter. It's mainly because of the increase we saw in the non-operating income. ", "Non-operating income is mainly due to investment of the surplus we have. The yield has gone up in the March quarter, something around 7% in December quarter to 10% in March quarter. So going forward for next year, I think the effective tax rate could remain in the same range somewhere between 11% to 12%. It could slightly go up depending on the non-operating income. Otherwise, it should be within the range. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And can you just remind us, over the next couple of years how you expect the tax rate to trend based on the change in the tax gain as well as kind of the maturities with different facilities? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "The percentage on the tax will also reduce? ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I'm sorry. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "What is your question? Can you please repeat? ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Sure. If you could just give us a sense for where you see the tax rate going over the next couple of years? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think, in India, we have a ten-year tax holiday. It goes off by end of fiscal 2009. We also have a new scheme called Special Economic Zone scheme, which gives something around 15-year tax holiday. So, then maybe around 5% of our revenue comes from SEZ scheme, rest of it comes from the old STP scheme. So, till the end of 2009, the effective tax rate could remain within the range. ", "In 2010, it could spike up. There will be [state] function. But again, it depends on how much of our revenue comes from the new scheme at that point of time. It's very difficult to predict. At least till the end of 2009, the effective tax rate could be within this range. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. So when you get into 2010, is there any chance that once you see that spike that we come back to the 11% to 12% range? Or do you think it will normalize at a higher level? And if so, can you give us just a range of where it would normalize? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "What is the range for the tax rate? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think, as I told you, till the end of 2009, the effective tax rate could be somewhere between 11% to 12%. It could slightly go up depending on the quantum of non-operating income. Beyond that, it actually depends on how much of our revenue comes from the new SEZ scheme. How much comes from STP scheme is very difficult to predict now. So, we have to move forward and see what is the proportion of revenue is coming from the new scheme at that point of time to look at the rates. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Great, thank you. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Prudential. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Hi. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. In the Financial Services segment, it's growing at double-digit sequentially for each quarter, and I am not sure if I account this, but during the quarter, obviously it only grew 1%. So it grew below the company's sequential growth for the quarter. Why did it? I just don't know why it fell like that? Why did it grow below the company's average? In other words, was there a client loss or did clients for some reasons spent less than the others? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Typically, the budgets are placed in the first quarter. And if there is a delay in release of the budget, a particular client maybe growing slightly slower. Now when you look at the yearly number, as I said before 49% growth for the year. And we feel comfortable in saying that there is still growth. One of the projects which we were expecting just got signed off now. So, you should see continuous growth in the BFSI space. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "And then, so what should we model or what you guys expect for fiscal year '08 growth in that financial segment? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We cannot give you a segmented growth rate. We have given you our guidance for the company, which is 28% to 30%. We cannot give you segmented growth rates and things like that. It is the largest segment. We have details client-by-client, etcetera, but that's too much detail to give out at this point. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay. I was just hoping for, was it far below or above kind of where you would be tracking for 28% to 30% for the fiscal year '08? Just trying to get some color around that. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "No. I cannot give you anymore on that at this point. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay. And then on the maintenance side, that also sequentially had dropped a little bit. I just wanted to know if there was anything in there, in particular one-time items. The color around financial services was helpful. But how about maintenance, was there anything in there that sequentially grew a lot less than the company average? Just trying to make sure I understand that. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "I think you have to go more with client-wise growth, because we are trying to sell multiple services to a particular client. Development, Reengineering, Infrastructure, Management services, BPO services, Independent Validation Services, Consulting, Package, Implementation etcetera. And that's how we grow our clients. ", "Now, maintenance may be just steady state. There are no more applications being transferred to Infosys for the test study. In this quarter, Development grew, Package Implementation grew etcetera. ", "So again, quarter-upon-quarter, don't focus on a particular service. Look at annual trend. Maintenance has grown 39% annually, Development grew 49%, and Package Implementation grew 55%. Now those are numbers, which probably are easier to explain because there is a trend there. We can see where it's going. But quarter-upon-quarter it's slightly difficult to say, because it depends then on what happens within a particular client, etcetera. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay. And then just on the guidance, what percentage of your fiscal year '08 guidance is already signed or already committed from your clients? And then, is there a percentage that you have to go out and win during the year to hit that guidance, or is it already kind of contracted? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "When we look four quarters out, typically, we have visibility of 65% to 70% of the revenue. 93% of our business is repeat business. Next year also we expect 90% to 95% of our business to be repeat business. So, when we say visibility, either we have signed contracts or we have visibility into the budgets of the clients. They necessarily don't translate to signed contract. But we have good visibility and reasonable assurance of happening. Now, when we look at one quarter out, then we have almost 95% visibility typically, and that's how we manage our business, one quarter out 90% plus; three quarters out, 65% plus; four quarters out, 65% plus. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay. And then just finally, I know you don't have price increases in the fiscal year '08 guidance. If you do get the price increases, I guess you've seen here over the last couple of quarters, is there a way to quantify the impact how that will help the operating margins by any price increases you do get? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think to get a price increase, most of it flows down to the net income. But it depends on where you get, if it is onsite, the flow to the net income will be lower, but if it is offshore, it will be higher. So net-net, for every one percentage point increase in prices, the impact could be somewhere between 3 to 50 basis points on operating margins. ", "Bryan Keane - Prudential", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equity Research. ", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "Thank you. Two questions, first is on the Visa, what is the situation right now? And how many did we apply last year? And how was it this year? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, the situation is that the Visa close within two days, you know that. We've applied for adequate number of Visas to meet our growth for later part of this year and the next year. We received a message saying that they are getting ready now to look at all the people, who filed, and make a random selection and inform them. ", "So, waiting for people to inform, it's going to be a random selection like a lottery. So, we'll wait and see. And obviously, if we don't get what we need, we have to look at other alternatives, as it is we are hiring people locally, that scheme is going on. And we are also looking at other ways to make sure that we are not impacted in any manner. I am sure, that with people like you talking about the short of the Visas, there could be some action in [capital] too. ", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "Perfect. The second question is regarding the Vista rollout, are you seeing any more up-tick in the testing part of the business or maybe infrastructure services because of Vista, or you are thinking it's little early to take that as a positive momentum yet? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "XP rollout has been a very successful service from Infosys. We received various awards et cetera for our XP rollout service. We are ready with a service for Vista, which includes testing, which includes downloading the images in an automated manner, zero-touch download and things like that. So, we have the service ready. But it's too early at this point to see any significant revenue opportunity. But definitely we are going to market with this. We are one of the large partners with Microsoft on this, when Vista was launched. ", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "Perfect. And the last question again, I'll try to get little bit more insights into the Visa situation. Has our guidance factored for the best case scenario or the most probable scenario in terms of the costs associated with processing of Visas? ", "Nandan Nilekani", "Well, we normally are right in the middle of these issues near overtly optimistic, not overtly pessimistic, because we take a very realistic view. And I think that there will be enough in the system to make sure that we need our numbers. ", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "Perfect. Congratulations on good execution. ", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Price from Stifel Nicolaus. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thank you very much. First question is, some of my industry checks indicate that Infosys has now indicated a willingness under some circumstances to entertain taking over people and even assets that may come with some of these larger deals. My questions on that, one, is that correct? And if so, how do you view that from a margin impact perspective? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "This is Shibulal. On the first one, on people takeovers, we have done a little bit of that. And today we have the scale to acquire people while acquiring business because if you look at us today, we have 9,000 people plus outside India. So, if you go for a deal, which is, let's say whatever size, then you have to takeover 100 people, that's a very small number compared to the number of people whom we have on-site. ", "On the utilization front, it is actually good, because these people already have worked. And they are working at the customer site, which also means that we have to send less number of people from India. So, if you have a 300-people project then that means 20% of that, that is, 80 people are authorized, 60 people are on site and we take over 30 people, we only have to send 30 people from here. So, it will workout all around as long as the GDM model is applied. ", "But in another situation, if you takeover 300 people and that means you have to apply GDM to it, 200 people will have to be reassigned. Even that is not a large number, given the current business model and the number of people we have on-site. ", "As far as the infrastructure piece is concerned, we are etched to do it. We do not have any plans to do it in a large scale at this point. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Just I heard you correctly on the assets. So in small cases you will do it, but nothing that you expect have any material impact. Is that fair? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "On the asset side, I don't think we even do it in small scale. We may do it in the future, and even then it will not have any material impact, it will be quantitatively small. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And given your comment just now on in terms of utilization, I mean, is it fair to say that that's one factor driving your willingness may be to drive the utilization higher in fiscal '08? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. I think these are two different things, because mostly the people takeover issue comes on large deals, which are multimillion dollar deals. The utilization, we are very comfortable with high 70s, and currently it is below 75. So these are definitely deal-linked issues. We will do both, given the right business opportunity, we will take over people. But irrespective of that, we will drive the utilization up. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then just to go back to the margin headwinds, the 300 basis points from wage inflation, about a 150 bps from currency, I think on the last call you talked about, if you move the utilization into the upper 70s, you could get maybe a 150 basis points benefit from that. ", "And correct me if I am wrong. You said you are not building in any benefit from pricing. Infosys Consulting may be gives you 50 bps, I think, I missed some of the other subsidiary expectations, but that is probably somewhat comparable. May be you have a 100 bps in SG&A. I still kind of feel like I am falling a little short of the 450 basis point offset. Can you help me out? What am I missing? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "There are multiple levels to that. Bala is going to take that question. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "We are saying that there will be some 300 basis points impact on the margin because of wage increases. Rupee could impact something around 150-160 basis points. We are saying it could get offset by the benefit we see on the G&A of something around 150-160 basis points. But utilization, we always wanted to be at the low end of the range. Today, we are ending March at 74% utilization. We are comfortable somewhere between 76% to 80%. So, we could take up the utilization up, and it could give us some benefit because in every 1 percentage point in utilization, you could see an impact of 40 basis points on the margins. ", "On the subsidiary, especially the Consulting, in fiscal '07, they made a loss of $25 million. Next year, we are expecting them to make a loss of $4 million. That could give us some 50 basis points. ", "So, what we are saying is, these are indicative things, which we can use to offset the margin. There are several levers. We use some of them at some point of time, or all them at some point of time to offset the margin. What we are saying is, in spite of the wage increase, in spite of the rupee impact, we should be able to maintain the margins by using some of these levers. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then last question would be what happens to the margins, if the rupee happens to reverse, maybe some of the liquidity concerns going on over India from a currency standpoint reverse? Or if the rupee starts to reverse and depreciate against the dollar, do you reinvest that, do you let it flow through, how would you treat that? Thank you. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "The same thing what happened in the first quarter of last fiscal will happen. The margins could improve, the rupee could depreciate. But we could reinvest some of the margins back into the business, if required. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "You next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with Bear Stearns. ", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It has to do with seasonality of sequential revenue growth. And even the March '07 quarter recorded for 5% sequential revenue growth, compared to the full year revenue growth of 28% to 30%. In other words, the company anticipates higher sequential revenue growth in some of the latter quarters of fiscal year '08. But when I go back and look at the history of Infosys, the March quarter tends to be the second and sometimes the first best sequential revenue growth quarter seasonally. So, my question comes down to, why is that the March sequential revenue growth more than 5% and why the confidence that some of the later quarters will be higher than 5%? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Last year also we started giving a guidance of about 6.1% growth or something like that. So, the guidance was lower, and then we accelerated. ", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Right. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "And we are saying that this is going to happen. But we give the guidance based on the data we have at this point. We are prepared to accelerate growth. We are ready for acceleration, because we have the bend et cetera. And then as the year progresses, we can fine tune this. We are giving guidance four quarters out. So, we can fine tune it. ", "Now, what happens is, there is certain assumption of growth, which determines ultimately, what is a maximum growth we can get in any particular year. And that's what we need to really adjust given the environment. But this 28% to 30% growth is what we are seeing today that we are comfortable with and that's what we have given as guidance. ", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Right. But then if I just ask, don't you agree with me that the March quarter is usually one of your best sequential seasonal quarters, and is there anything that you are taking into account when you gave 5% that makes you seem like this will be something different than a typical seasonal quarter? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yeah, typically you are right. The third and fourth quarters are slow quarters for us, third quarter because of more holidays, fourth quarter because of new budgets being created etcetera. But those are factored at this point in our guidance. ", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Right. Okay. Thanks for your help. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna Financials. ", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financials", "Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just have one quick question for Bala though. What operating margin guidance is contemplated for Infosys BPO Progeon for your fiscal '08 assumptions? And at what point do you see Infosys BPO achieving corporate-wide operating margins? Thank you. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Essentially, for the BPO, let me ask Amitabh to answer this question. Amitabh is here. ", "Amitabh Chaudhry", "Our guidance for the next year is $215 million, and we are talking about keeping our margins at the same level. If you take out the -- we had in our margins this year a stock compensation charge. So, if you take that out, we had margin of 23% for this year. ", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financials", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sandy Notardonato from Robert W. Baird. ", "Sandy Notardonato - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Thank you. Just two questions. First, can you talk about what you are seeing for FY '08 rate in terms of the more discretionary spending as a part of your business, perhaps custom application development and IT consulting? And then I have a follow up. ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Clearly, this quarter we saw Development going up. We saw Consulting going up. We saw Package Implementation is going up. Discretionary spend is happening. We also believe that companies need to transform themselves to take advantage of globalization, to compete better. So that means that they will have to look at new technologies, new geographies, new sourcing strategies and things like that. So that's something, which we see right now in the environment. ", "Sandy Notardonato - Robert W. Baird", "And you expect that to continue in FY '08 in areas such as financial services as well? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We do see that some of these services, especially Package Implementation, Consulting, etcetera to continue to be strong. ", "Sandy Notardonato - Robert W. Baird", "And stint of financial services as well? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. We don't want to get into too much narrow in terms of details. But definitely, financial services being one of the largest industry verticals for us, we do see growth in financial services. ", "Sandy Notardonato - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, good. And follow up question is, can you talk about your plan for employee training, the investments that you are making in FY '08 in dollar terms versus FY '07 and also what your CapEx plans are for FY '08? ", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We're claiming in this year, in FY '07, we spent about $140 million. But then we trained a larger number of people. I think going forward for the next year at this point of time, we have to train about 25,000 people and I would estimate that the cost will remain around the same level, give or take $5 million, $6 million, because the $140 million was for about 30,000 people. Normally, we'll have more lateral training, but lateral training costs less than fresher training. So, this will be the number. ", "On the CapEx, I'll just give you the dollar figures. Bala will give you the figures. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "On the CapEx, we spent around $336 million in fiscal '07. Our guidance for fiscal '08 is somewhere between $420 million to $440 million. ", "Sandy Notardonato - Robert W. Baird", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "My friends, this brings us to the end of this conference call. I would like to pass on the proceedings back to Bangalore. ", "Nandan Nilekani", "I want to thank all of you for coming on this call. I think we have ended a very good year, and we look forward to the next year with confidence. We believe that we have a clear goal. And as every year goes by, I think, our strategy, our story, our position in the market is solidifying. And we hope to continue to perform on that basis under the new leadership that we have. ", "Thank you very much. See you next quarter. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. "]}

", "Mr. Mahindroo, you may begin your conference. ", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Randy. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to this conference call to discuss Infosys' financial results for the quarter ending June 30th, 2007. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in the U.S. Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and MD, Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan, COO, Mr. S. D. Shibulal and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management. ", "We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter ending September 30th, 2007 and year ending March 31, 2008. After that, we'll open up the discussions for Q&A. ", "Before I pass it on to Infosys management, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov. I would now like to pass it on to Infosys management. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thank you, Sandeep, and good evening, good morning to every one of you. Welcome to this analysts' call at the end of quarter one. This quarter we have had a very high-quality organic growth, very good growth. Sequentially our revenue grew by 7.5%. Our blended pricing went up by 1% this quarter. ", "And if you look at geographies, we have grown 7.5% in North America, 8.4% in Europe. Across our services, some of the services have shown strong growth this quarter. Across the different industry segments - banking and capital markets, insurance, telecom, retail, manufacturing, transportation, logistics - we have seen again growth across the sectors. ", "We added 35 new clients this quarter. Our top 10 clients grew 3.9% this quarter, whereas the rest of the clients, the non-top 10 clients, grew by 9.3%. Last quarter there was a concern whether -- because the growth in the top 10 clients was about 11%, what about the rest. So we are seeing broad growth across our client segments. ", "Our utilization has gone up to 75% and we have added 7,000 employees at the gross level and 3,730 employees at the net level this quarter. And we are revising our guidance for the rest of the year from 28% to 30% at the beginning of the quarter. We're revising our guidance now to 30% to 31%. And on the EPS also we are increasing our guidance. ", "So all in all this has been a very strong performance by the company. And when you look at what is the dampener, what is the down -- what is the challenge for the company, it is really only one, namely the rupee, appreciating rupee. And we have been able to a great extent manage that, both with operational efficiency as well as, of course, non-operating income. And when you include all that, at the EPS level against a guidance of $0.41 a share, we have been able to give $0.46 per share. So we have been able to manage this in a tough quarter where the rupee appreciated by 7%. ", " Now let me request my colleague, Shibulal, the Chief Operating Officer, to talk in detail about the segments and things like that. ", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you, Kris. This is Shibulal. As Kris mentioned, we have seen 7.5% sequential growth this quarter. We have seen strong growth all around. North America contributed 62.6% of our revenue this quarter. Europe contributed 26.8% of our revenue this quarter. Last quarter the European revenue was 26.6%. So Europe actually has grown ahead of the average. Europe grew 8.4% quarter-on-quarter. Rest of the world contributed 8.8%. ", "From a service portfolio point of view, development has marginally come down, maintenance has gone up. Together they have contributed close to 40%. Package implementation contributed 18.4% of our revenue, consulting 4.9% of our revenue. The consulting revenue this quarter is 4.9% compared with 4.3% the last quarter. ", "Consulting grew by 23.2% quarter-on-quarter. Testing contributed 7.5% of our revenue this quarter. Testing grew 11.1% quarter-on-quarter. Business process management contributed 5.4%. Again, business process management grew 11.2% quarter-on-quarter. Our revenue from services accounted for 96.8% this quarter. The products revenue was 3.2%. ", "From a vertical perspective, banking, insurance and financial services contributed 36.1% of our revenue, manufacturing 13.6%. Manufacturing grew 13% quarter-on-quarter. Retail 10.8%, telecom 22%. Telecom grew 8.2% quarter-on-quarter. We've also seen strong growth in energy and utilities and transportation and in services. ", "Fixed price is 29.1%. It has gone up from last quarter. Last quarter it was 27.4%. Onsite revenue is 54.1% compared with 54.3% last quarter. The revenue productivity, per capita revenue productivity has gone up by 1% blended, 1.4% onsite and 1% offshore. The blended revenue productivity has gone up by 1%. ", "We have added 35 new clients this quarter. The total clients stand at 509 as of the end of this quarter. Our $ 1 million clients have gone up from 275 to 285, $5 million clients 113. We have one client giving us more than $200 million. Our $8 million and above clients have actually doubled from last quarter to this quarter. Last quarter it was four, this quarter it is eight. ", "Our utilization has gone up. Our utilization this quarter, excluding trainees, is 75.1%, last quarter it was 73.7%. We have recruited 7,000 people this quarter gross and a net of 3,730 people. ", "So, with that, let me pass on to Bala for financial performance. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning, everybody. This quarter has been an excellent quarter for us. The revenues went up sequentially by 7.5% in U.S. dollar terms; it's $928 million. When we guided revenue in the beginning of the quarter, we said we may reach around $908 million. We were able to maintain the net margin in spite of the headwind effect we have seen in terms of currency, visa and salary costs during the quarter. ", "We have seen the currency appreciating by around 7% during this quarter. We guided, in the beginning of the quarter, at INR43.10. The average rate for the quarter is INR40.66, which means appreciation of 7%, which impacted the margin by 3.5%. We also had the salary increases coming into effect from April, which impacted the margin by 2.5%. The visa costs impacted the margin by another 1%. ", "So, overall, we had an impact of 7% on the margin due to rupee, wages and visa, which was to some extent offset by increase in utilization of 3%, which impacted the margin positively by 1.5%. Pricing increased by 1%, which impacted the margin positively by 1%. And losses in the subsidiaries and the scale benefits added another 1.5%. ", "So, overall, we had an impact of 7% which got offset by another 4% coming from utilization, pricing and the scale benefits. So net, net, our operating margin got impacted by 3 percentage points. ", "The non-operating income went up because we had increased our hedging positions. Today we have close to $925 million of hedging position. It was $470 million last quarter. We have seen a ForEx gain of $18 million coming in the non-operating income. So it enabled us to maintain our net margin similar to what you have seen last quarter. ", "We have seen the pricing going up by 1% during this quarter; it went up by 1.4% onsite, 1% offshore. On a blended basis it went up by 1%. Going forward, we have increased our guidance in dollar terms for the full year. Earlier we said the revenues could go up somewhere between 28% to 30% for the full year. ", "Now we increase it to a range of 29% to 31% for the full year. We also said the EPS could grow somewhere between 28% to 30%. In the guidance we assumed the billing rate to be constant from the level what we saw in the first quarter. We are not assuming any big deals in the guidance. ", "We are assuming the currency to remain at INR40.58 for the rest of the year. What it means is the model has been reset from INR43.10, from what we guided in April, to INR40.58. And after assuming that currency will appreciate to INR40.58, we are assuming that net margin will remain at the same level like last year. So it shows the resilience in the model, which has the capacity to absorb the sharp currency movement, the wage increases and the visa costs, and still we are able to maintain the net operating margin at the same level like what we saw in the last year. ", "And in terms of DSO, the DSO days were 67 days, 80% of the receivables are less than 30 days. We have close to $1.6 billion of cash at the end of June. And we believe that we have a model which is robust, which is flexible, which is able to absorb all the impact of currency and still enable us to maintain the net margin level at the same level as what we saw last year. ", "Our guidance for the full year assumes that operating margin could decline by something around 100 to 150 basis points, while the net margins could be maintained at a similar level what we saw in the last year, within a narrow band, because the non-operating income could offset some of the impact we saw on the operating side. ", "So overall, net-net it was a great quarter. We are increasing the manpower guidance for the full year by 1,500 employees. Earlier we said we will add 24,500 employees. Now we are saying we will hire 26,000 employees. Our utilization rate, excluding trainees, was around 75% at the end of first quarter. So what it means is we are readying our model to take care of any growth opportunities we see in the marketplace. We are seeing good volume growth; we are seeing a lot of opportunities in the marketplace. So we are trying to add more people and create the flexibility in the model to make sure that we don't miss any growth opportunities. ", "With this, I conclude my presentation. Now we can open the floor for questions and answers. Thank you. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. ", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Services", "Hi. Thank you. It's Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. I had two questions, the first for Bala and the second for Kris. Bala, the other income line has exceeded our estimates rather substantially. And some of the detail that you described related to foreign exchange and hedging policy was helpful, but I was wondering if you could add some additional color on that because it was fully double what we were estimating? ", "And then I'll just ask Kris, have you contemplated, in light of the rally in the rupee, have you contemplated what you think of as the ideal onsite/offshore mix in the context of increasing costs offshore, because I notice that your onsite component continues to rise? Thank you. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Bala here, when we guided in April, we assumed a currency rate of INR43.10. The currency has appreciated by 7% in the first quarter. It impacted the margin by 3.5%. For the rest of the year, we are assuming the currency to be at the same level as what we saw at the end of June, at INR40.58. So what it means is our guidance assumes that the operating margin could decline slightly, but it could be more than made up on the non-operating side and our net margin could be at the same level as last year. What it means is the model is so robust and flexible it is able to absorb the impact. The margin levels are already reset for a currency level at INR40.58, as compared to INR43.10 what we guided in the beginning. ", "So we are saying that we will be able to absorb the currency impact for the full year and still we'll be able to maintain the margin at the same level as what we saw in the last year. Now I will give it to Kris. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, regarding your question about what is the ideal onsite/offshore ratio. So around 50% is the ideal onsite/offshore ratio because you still need to remember that we have tax breaks in India and we have significant benefits because of that. I think when 2009 comes, 2010 comes, as some of the centers we have in India come off the tax holiday, then we need to look at what is the ideal onsite/offshore mix because today the significant driver will be based on the tax holiday we have. ", "Having said that, we are constantly looking at our business mix. Some of the services like enterprise solutions, even though they have a higher onsite content, today they're running at around 38%, 39% onsite, the margins are actually better than the company average. So we play around with that and that\u2019s one of the levers we have in order to offset the rupee appreciation and the impact on margins. So we are leveraging our services mix in order to maintain our margin. ", "Our services today, if you look at, 42% of our services are non-ADM already. And some of the faster growing services are services like consulting, package implementation, et cetera., which have a slightly higher consulting, of course, is almost all onsite and the package implementation, as I said, is about 39%, 40% onsite. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Thanks. Bala, you've indicated that you haven't really factored any changes in pricing throughout the remainder of the year. Since we've seen a 1% blended increase in pricing during the quarter, is there any reason we should assume that that should stay constant throughout the year and we shouldn't see any further movements higher? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, Moshe, this is Kris here. We believe that the pricing is favorable to us. We believe that in new contracts, et cetera, we would get 3% to 4% above company average. And even when contracts come up for renewal, we are able to get slightly better prices. But having said that, because the predictability of this is not that good, we have to go through these negotiations, et cetera, we have not factored in, that's all we are saying. ", "The environment is actually favorable, but in the model we have not factored in. It is set at end of quarter one. So we have assumed this 1% already; that we have assumed for the rest of the year. But we have not assumed any further increase in revenue per employee; it stays flat. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Okay. And then can you talk a bit more about, remind us some of the levers that you have in the model today, besides the currency hedge, talk about some of the levers that could actually help you defend your margins down the road? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, Moshe, this is Shibulal. We have a number of levers in the system to make sure that our margin aspirations are met. Of course, pricing is number one. We are seeing stable pricing with an upward bias. Our new contracts are coming somewhere between 3% to 4% above our average. And the negotiations are also, we are trying to do it about 2% to 3% above our average. Not that in all cases that is happening, but in the majority of the cases that is what is happening. That is number one. ", "Utilization is the second lever we have. Our utilization right now is at around 75%. We are quite comfortable at high 70s, low 80s, which means that we have some slack on the utilization front. ", "Next one is the service portfolio mix. Our services like package implementation, system integration, consulting do have high revenue productivity. Also services like independent validation, infrastructure management are predominantly offshore also. Product engineering we are predominantly offshore. And so they have high margin capability. So managing our portfolio mix allows us to manage margins. We can manage our customer mix, so we can try and grow customers who have high margins. So that is another portfolio, another important lever which we have. ", "Onsite/offshore ratio is next one. And that allows us, the more offshore work which we do, we'll get better margins. It is a slightly difficult lever to pull because it takes a little while to pull it back and forth. So that is one. ", "Then next one is scale. We do get scale benefits as we grow. And also the SG&A and other expenses, the subsidiaries are actually, in percentage terms, higher than of the parent. So as the subsidiaries come to age, the drag, which it creates on the parent, keeps coming down and that allows us to manage our margin. ", "Then the last one I want to mention is the variable compensation structure we have, which is also linked to revenue and margins. So the variable compensation accruals are based on certain revenue and certain margins, which are goals for us. So that allows us to also provides us with a lever. ", "So, in that sense, there are a number of levers we have. The point to remember is that all the levers are never optimized at the same point in time because this is a dynamic business, so things move back and forth. So at any point in time we can try and pull some of those levers. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "And then a final question, maybe Bala. Can you repeat some of the pluses and minuses that impacted EBIT margin during the quarter and then also quantify the losses that you had from the subsidiaries as well? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "See, the rupee appreciated by 7% during the quarter. The average rupee, dollar rate was INR43.75 in March quarter. It is INR40.66 in June quarter, an appreciation of 7%. It impacted the operating margin by 350 basis points. ", "Wages had increased effective April 1. That impacted the margin by 250 basis points. We had the visa costs coming in the first quarter because all the H1 visa we had to apply in the first quarter, that impacted the margin by 100 basis points. So, overall there was an impact of 700 basis points on the margin because of rupee, wages and visa. ", "We had the utilization rate going up by 3%. That means a positive impact on the operating margin of 150 basis points. Pricing went up by 1% on a blended basis. That had a favorable impact of 100 basis points. ", "The losses in the subsidiaries, especially consulting, has come down. Last quarter the consulting made a loss of $10 million. This quarter the losses have come down to $1 million or so. So it seems and plus some of the scale benefits we saw in the SG&A. ", "In total that favorably contributed to the margin of 150 basis points. So net, net the impact on operating margin was 300 basis points for this quarter. ", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, guys. Good evening. Just wanted to check two quick things real quickly on the model. First of all, Bala, can you talk about the sales and marketing at about 5.5% as a percentage of revenue? How sustainable is that level and what more can you do on that number? ", "In other words, can we expect a run rate at those levels or does this number have to come back up at some point for you to actually continue to drive growth in your new clients and existing clients? ", "And then, secondly, can you just confirm, based on what we're looking at right now, the interest income alone for the quarter is reported at $45 million and it looks like in the fourth quarter of last year it was about $19 million. ", "What drove that upside in the interest income? Is it purely just rates or is there something else going through that number, because the cash balances didn't appear to change all that much? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, the sales and marketing costs have come down this quarter because the losses in Infosys Consulting has come down. Part of this is due to efficiency we brought in on the sales and marketing side for the Infosys Consulting. ", "I think the sales and marketing costs could be somewhere between 6% to 6.5% of revenues for the rest of the year. We hope to get some scale benefits on the G&A side. So, overall, I think sales and marketing costs will be somewhere between 6% to 6.5% of revenue for the next three quarters. ", "On the non-operating income first quarter we had $18 million of ForEx income on the non-operating side. The yield on the investible surplus has gone up to 11% in the first quarter. So that's why the non-operating income was very high in the first quarter. ", "In the second quarter onwards the yield could come down to 9%. So you could see around $37 million, $38 million coming on the non-operating income, which is purely based on treasury income out of the investment of surplus in various instruments. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Got it. No, that makes perfect sense, then, in terms of where that came from. Then the second part for me is more of just a demand-related question. When I look at the different puts and takes, I guess my biggest question is why did development slow in the quarter on a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis, and how are you guys thinking about that as we kind of go forward? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, this is more of a quarter-on-quarter variation rather than anything else. We are not seeing any secular trend in that area. It is just a quarter-on-quarter variation. And the maintenance has gone up, actually, simultaneously, so ADM revenue has tend to remain stable. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. So the offset to it was higher maintenance offset by lower development in the quarter? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities. ", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Thank you and, again, congratulations on good execution on a very challenging environment. Two questions, first is regarding your Finacle product line. It seems there was a sequential decline in that business. I was wondering, are you seeing any competitive threats or challenges from i-flex in that space? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, it's just the seasonality of the business because you know some part of the revenues could be because of the fact that we have done some installation and the customization the part of it comes to an end. That's why this seasonality. In fact, we are seeing a greater demand than ever before in the lifetime of the Finacle product. We're looking at several exciting deals and I think it's very, very strongly positioned to be the dominant product in this area. ", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "The second question I have is regarding the fixed projects. I was wondering which specific kind of services do you put into a fixed product -- sorry, fixed project category? And what are the trends in that space? Thank you. ", "S. D. Shibulal", "So fixed price projects are where we give a fixed bid based on deliverables. It is not effort based, even though in some occasions we also share the effort mix because some fixed price projects we do share the effort mix. Here the payments are linked to delivery rather than time spent. And one thing to remember is that we have very long relationships with our customers, and we do time and material and fixed price with the same customer on a continuing basis. So, in that sense, there is a certain amount of transparency even in the fixed price bids. Our fixed price this quarter is about 29.1%. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Yes. Rod Bourgeois here with Bernstein. Guys, I would like to ask how would your strategy change if the rupee were to begin to depreciate in the upcoming quarters? In other words, you seem to be aggressively pulling levers to counteract the rupee appreciation impact on EPS. But if the rupee were to begin depreciating, would this alter your strategy going forward and would it enable you to at all pursue growth more aggressively? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, if the rupee depreciates, it could create some slackness in the system which we can use to reinvest to accelerate the growth or to make investment on sales and marketing, or to enhance some of the strategy initiatives like consulting in China. So if the rupee depreciates, it will be favorable to us. It could create some slack in the system which we can reinvest in the business. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. So, in that context, it sounds like there's investments you'd like to make that the rupee is preventing you from being able to make right now. Are you at all currently somewhat trading growth for margins? In other words, is the rupee appreciation causing you to miss some growth opportunities that might be out there at this point in time? When you look at the sales and marketing costs, the sequential change in those costs, it raises that question whether you're trading growth at all for margins at this point in time. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Not really. We are trying to grow as fast as possible. But Infosys always has been focused on the quality of the growth also, or the profit margins also. We have one of the highest margins in the industry. So we are not necessarily trading growth for margins. Having said that, we also try and maintain certain minimum margins and things like that. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Sure, got it. ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Bala here. The sales and marketing costs have come down because the losses in the subsidiary has come down, because some of the efficiency on the sales and marketing side. I don't think we are going to cut down sales and marketing because of currency. Even if you look at our model, our utilization rate was 75% and we're adding another 1,500 people more this year. So we are not cutting down growth just because the currency has appreciated. We are making all the investments for growth. But what I am saying is if there is a slack in the system, we'll try to reinvest more to accelerate the growth. ", "Rod Bourgeois", "Got it. All right. That makes sense. And so, as you look at the factors that drive your revenue growth outlook, I'm wondering if there are potential factors in your outlook that could enable your sequential revenue growth performance to improve later in fiscal 2008. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Well, definitely the market conditions are there. If you look at the number of large deals which are out there, the number of deals which we are participating, the number of transformational deals which we could participate because the profile of the Company has changed, we have a strong consulting practice now. So the opportunities are there to see if we can increase the growth. So it is there. ", "That's why we say the market conditions are actually good at this point of time. For companies like Infosys, which have broad capabilities, broad range of services, able to handle complex assignments, etcetera. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "And there's some of those deals, particularly the larger ones, that you're excluding from the guidance assumptions that you've given us. Is that correct? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. So whatever we have won to date is factored in. Whatever we are in the process of participating, negotiating, etc., we cannot include because we don't know when it's going to conclude, how it's going to conclude, whether we are going to win or not. See the pipeline is there but we don't have enough track record or enough experience to say or to include them in our guidance at this point. These are a few deals. The numbers are increasing but they are not like our regular business. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "One other thing, just to slip in here, that may be good to clarify for the U.S. investors. I know this came up on the call earlier this morning for the Indian investors. Can you talk about the issues in Mysore that have affected the hiring progress so far this year? ", "Mohandas Pai", "Well, I think it has not affected recruitment. Some of these batches which were supposed to come in the last fortnight of June, we have pushed it to the first fortnight of July. So in the whole sequence of the matter this doesn't have any material impact. So I think we have planned it out. It has not had any material impact. ", "And we have training facilities across India. For example, we have started training in Chandigarh in the north of India. We have started training in Hyderabad. We have started training in Bangalore. So we made it part of this. So, overall, I think about 1,000 people have been pushed forward by maybe about three weeks. And it's not a material impact on us. ", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Caso with Wachovia Securities. ", "Ed Caso - Wachovia Securities", "Thank you for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the H1B and L1 situation in the United States, where you stand as far as the forward outlook both on an intermediate term and a long-term basis? And also the impact year over year as opposed to sequentially from the visa cost? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So currently we have a sufficient number of visas for our business. We're also looking at accelerating local hiring to manage going forward, etc. So immediate in the short term this is not going to have any impact. Longer term we are watching to see where the discussions are going, how the legislative change is going to be effected and things like that. So we are watching the situation. ", "Proactively we are growing our non-U.S. business, as you know. Europe is now 26.8% of our revenues and we are growing Europe proactively. So there are a couple of things we are doing in terms of local hires, in terms of Europe business, etcetera. ", "Ed Caso - Wachovia Securities", "Another question is on your interest level appetite willingness for both going after acquisitions, as well as willingness to acquire captives, maybe to accelerate your BPO business. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Acquisition is part of our strategy, either to look at new geographies or do focused acquisitions to enhance our service capabilities like consulting or BPO and things like that. Generally, we will do smaller focused acquisitions. But if an opportunity comes our way which is large, definitely we have to look at it seriously because in acquisitions they have to agree to our terms and conditions. They have to agree to be acquired. And we have to do it in a manner in which it is positive for Infosys as well as the acquired entity, the employees of both the entities, etcetera. So that's been our general philosophy in acquisition - focused, targeted, smaller. ", "Having said that, exceptions are always possible. Now, specific cases I cannot comment; especially rumors, etcetera, we cannot comment. ", "Ed Caso - Wachovia Securities", "Can you talk a little bit about the captives? There seems to be a growing interest of those who've created captives on the BPO side, possibly to be selling them. Would you do that to help further accelerate your BPO business or is the cultural issues too great? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, generally, captives are not doing so well in India. Forrester have put out a report that said 60% of the captives are actually not meeting its goals, have not given the value benefit expected. Costs are higher. Attrition is very high, etcetera. So, generally, captives are not actually doing that well. ", "Captives are an opportunity for us to look at integrating with Infosys, taking over that and running it for our clients, etcetera. When a client looks at setting up a new captive in India, sometimes we do help them set it up. Generally we don't like to do build, operate, transfer, etcetera, because there's no guarantee that the employees will move. So we don't believe that BOT model is a realistic model. But generally we support our clients if they want to set up captive because that's positive overall because it's reinforcing the model. ", "Ed Caso - Wachovia Securities", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Price with Stifel Nicolaus. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Thanks very much for taking a couple of questions from me. First question, just to understand, Bala, it looks like the rupee-based guidance cut and how you performed in the quarter. If I'm looking at that right, that was more than due to the currency impact you referred to, correct? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yeah, you're right, because the currency moved by 7%. It means we have lost around INR1,000 crores, which is equivalent to something around $250 million. So that is why the rupee guidance was revised downward. But we increased our dollar guidance. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right. Okay. And the second quick question, the interest yield you said could come down quarter over quarter by 200 basis points. Why is that? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "We have invested the surplus money in deposits with financial institutions and banks. And also we have put the money in some liquid mutual funds the yield has been great last quarter. Because of the general inflationary environment all the banks raised their interest rates on deposits. I think now there is enough liquidity in the banking system so the yields could come down to close to 9%. It was 11% last quarter. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And, last question, you're now up at 26,000 gross hires for the year. I think, if memory serves, that was up from about 24,500 from last quarter. And I believe I heard that 10,000 of the gross hires are still going to the BPO business, which I believe is the same as last quarter. So the incremental hire is going into the IT business. But still adjusting for some level of attrition, low to mid teens, whatever the assumption is, there's still a pronounced slowdown in net global headcount growth based on the guidance that you've given in fiscal '08 versus the kind of net global headcount growth you had in fiscal '07. You can offset that with obviously what you're doing now in terms of utilization, ramping up the utilization. ", "But my question is, when you get to fiscal '09 you've had lower average headcount growth. You're running at higher utilization. What's the play in fiscal '09 in terms of growth if the currency hasn't turned around? Do you have to accelerate hiring, lateral hiring, which is expensive? Can you comment on that element of the gross margin, potential trade off? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "We always said we want to see the utilization somewhere between 76% to 80%. When we started the year, the utilization was something around 73%. So we said we want to keep utilization somewhere in the lower end of the band because we are seeing enough growth opportunities in the marketplace and we don't want to miss that. ", "Having said that, if required we will increase the utilization to make sure the margins are not impacted. Right now the utilization is 75%. The hiring is a function of growth. If we see a lot more opportunities in the marketplace, we may accelerate the hiring. We have an engine which can hire some 25,000, 30,000 people a year. We have a great training engine, which could train close to 60,000 employees in a year, come December 2007. So I think we have all the models in place. ", "If the growth opportunity is there, we can accelerate the hiring. But at the same time, we want to make sure that in an environment where demand is very strong, we want to be at the lower end of the band as far as utilization is concerned. ", "George Price - Stifel Nicolaus", "Let me ask you in a slightly different way. If looking out into the scenario I laid out just now, can you take -- if you do have to increase your hiring, which all else being equal, particularly if you have to do an increase in lateral hiring, is a more costly form of hiring. But if you have to hire more, do you think that going into the end of fiscal '08, that you'll still have the utilization buffer to push utilization further to still basically grow faster than the headcount growth? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, we think so. I think we are not going to cut down growth just because the currency has appreciated. Because the currency appreciates by another 10%, we are not going to let go of people. So I think we have to manage all that. Utilization is one of the levers. But at the same time, we don't want to cut down growth. We don't want to cut down investment, which will affect growth. So we will hire people if we see growth opportunities in the market, irrespective of where the currency is. ", "George Price, Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. ", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi, guys. Just one question on a clarity issue. It looks like a large percentage of your revenue came in from recurring places. One, I just wanted to know what causes that seasonality in the first quarter? It looks actually pretty high this quarter. ", "And, two, how do we reconcile that with the pipeline? That was up around 99%, I think, of recurring revenue. ", "S. D. Shibulal", "So this is Shibulal. It is a matter of how you compute. We consider the repeat business this fiscal year based on the customer base from last year. So when we say we have repeat business, what we mean is that this revenue came from customers, clients, who were with us last fiscal or before. ", "So in the first quarter the number will always be high because most of the revenue in Q1 will come from clients who were with us in the last fiscal year. By the time you come to Q2, so this quarter we have added new clients, 35. And next quarter we will add more clients, so the ratio will shift. So it is just a matter of how do you compute it. ", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "So at the end of the year, using that math, the percentage from recurring revenue should be much lower than in the beginning? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "If you look at the history, our repeat business is anywhere between 94% to 96% range. Even at the end of the year, 92% and about 92% to 96%, in that range, even at the end of the year, depending on how the revenue profile pans out. ", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "I guess just looking forward, my second and last question here is, on the labor front, what is your fresher/lateral hiring mix? And do you expect to sustain that through the back half of the year? ", "And how are you currently viewing the labor pool? Is it strong? Are wages still going to creep up? And thanks for taking my call. ", "Mohandas Pai", "Mohan here. I think we have succeeded in capturing the lateral pool substantially last year. Last year we hired about 8,000 people from the lateral pool. In the lateral pool, we've seen our conversion rate in the first quarter go up to something like 65% from around 55%. And I think we had about 1,800 people hired in the lateral pool this quarter. ", "And, going forward, we have the capability in terms of people who can go and hire. We have the capability in terms of people who need to do the interviews and do the processing. And we have a pipeline of people who applied. So we can easily scale it up from 1,800 to, say, 2,300 and have substantial spare capacity to take it up as and when required. We have built this capacity in the lateral pool. And I think our compensation structure is very competitive. And the very fact that companies like us are growing much faster than the rest of the industry is demonstrating that we are the winners in this field. ", "Second, we are diversifying the labor pool. For example, we are taking graduates to handle some of the business in our testing and infrastructure management services. Our BPO Company has developed substantial capacity to hire large numbers of people, train them and turn them around. And we are using them to hire graduates. But the pool of graduates in India is about 3 million people coming out every year, as against a pool of people who come to the IT industry who are engineers is only 400,000. ", "So even if, let's say, 10% to 15% of the incremental number that we hire for our work comes from the graduate pool, the substantially large number of people. We have experimented with that over the last two years and we find that some kind of work can be done by these people, and they do it possibly as diligently and as well as somebody else. In the whole structure they are one year behind. But I think this pool can turn out to be another large pool that we can tap. ", "In our structure they come in at a level which is one year below the level of the engineers who come in. And therefore to that extent there is some economic advantage too. And as they go up the ladder and they train, they're as good as anybody else. So we need to put in some extra training. The training will extend to something like six months, as against three to four months that we spend for the engineers. And I think we see our testing business, infrastructure business, growing at a very rapid pace as it become more of an end-to-end player. And we see huge demands in these areas. So getting into this pool also works out well for us to diversify the pool. ", "And I think what we're going to see in India now is companies trying to work at right skilling, getting the right person for the right job. And I must say that, amongst all companies, we have done a substantial amount of work in right skilling and identifying. So I think the pool of talent that we have is only getting wider as we go along. ", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "So would you expect attrition rates and wages to stabilize here? ", "Mohandas Pai", "For the last three quarters, attrition rates have stabilized. Second quarter of last year we had 2,040 people leave us in services, third quarter 2,040 and the fourth quarter it came down to 1,640 because of seasonalities. And this quarter it's 2,010. So the last four quarters I think it has stabilized. ", "Out of 13.7%, 1.5% is involuntary. It is the people who joined at the fresher level who do not complete the training because you've put in a tough gate to get four CGP out of five to qualify and get fully employed. And if you remove this one factor and compare that with the previous year, I think we're nearly there. So I think things have stabilized to a great extent. ", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Miller with Arete Research. ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research", "Yes. Hello, gents. It's Arete Research, of course. Some questions around growth, but firstly some clarification on Finacle, if I may. Isn't it the case, in fact, that Finacle revenues are actually down for the second quarter in succession? And I was looking at the headcount as well. In fact your headcount in the banking products unit has remained flat this quarter. And I can't reconcile this with your statement that demand is the best you've ever seen. If that's so, it sounds like you're really having trouble in turning the demand into sales. Can you comment on that? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, what you're seeing is the revenue actually billed to the client. And the revenue billed to the client depends upon the stages of completion of the project because Finacle revenue consists of three or four streams. The first stream is the license revenue. Second stream is the customization revenue. Third stream is annual maintenance charges. And fourth stream is any project work. So, depending upon how these pan out, you'll see variations in the project. ", "Now, you have seen an increase in the people in the Finacle group. That's primarily because we are seeing us being invited to several large transformational deals, which are substantially larger than any point of time in our history. We have been invited, we are bidding, and we've been shortlisted in a large number of them. And that's why I said the demand is the largest that we've seen for a fairly long period of time. And I think this will all come out in the future. So we are very positive about Finacle. What you're seeing now is possibly the portion of sales, maybe, let's say, four to five quarters ago because when you sell a product and recognize revenues there is a long tail. Remember, this is an enterprise product and there is a long tail in whatever we do. ", "So our statement has to be seen in the context of the current status, where we are called to bid for a large number of deals. We have signed some few large deals for which work has yet to start. And we also have been shortlisted. For example, if you look at LTM, June '06 to LTM '07, Finacle revenues last year went up by 52.2%. So in when the overall business grew by 43.7% last year on the LTM basis, last 12 months basis, Finacle business has grown up by 52.2%. You can see it in the statements that we have given. And this is what makes us optimistic. ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research ", "Okay. And moving then just onto the Infosys Consulting, you mentioned that the losses are now down to about $1 million. Can you just say again what was the top line revenues? And, in particular, what is the headcount number now in Infosys Consulting? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, we have Consulting as a subsidiary, which has certain revenues, and consulting as a service, which includes consulting at the solutions level, consulting in the architecture, in the system integration side, etcetera. So overall consulting revenue for this quarter is about $45.34 million. It's about 4.9% of revenues, up from\u2026 ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research", "Sorry. I'm referring specifically to Infosys Consulting, the subsidiary, please. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Infosys Consulting had a revenue of $13 million. The subsidiary had a revenue of $13 million this quarter. ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research", "And the loss after tax and the headcount? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "The headcount is about 220 and the loss is about $1 million. ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research", "That's great. And, just finally, as you always say, you never include mega deals in your guidance and your outlook. But can you tell us if you're seeing any change in the opportunity for mega deals? Is your pipeline for mega deals actually expanding or is it contracting? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "It is expanding clearly, both from a number perspective as well as size. Our credibility is going up as we win more, as we become larger and larger, as our capability increases, as we become more familiar with the whole negotiation and bidding process. So definitely our size, number, our ability to win, all these are increasing quarter upon quarter. ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research", "Sorry, you said your ability to win, in other words, your win rate is increasing as well? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. We are better at qualifying. Our win rate is increasing. ", "Anthony Miller - Arete Research", "Right. Thank you very much indeed. ", "Shekar Narayanan", "Hello. This is Shekar from Investor Relations team in Bangalore. We would like to take the last question now. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. First, Bala, can you break down the components of other income for us? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Can you repeat the question, David? ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Sure. Can you break down the components of other income between interest and FX gains, etc.? ", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes. The FX gain was $18 million. The treasury income is around $46 million. So totally it's around $62 million. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And I'm wondering if you could perhaps just give us some insight in terms of the pricing dynamic, as wages continue to go up and obviously we've got a fluctuating rupee. How is the customer and the conversations you have with the customer go when you get into an environment like this? And how receptive are they to these -- helping you mitigate some of these fairly dramatic changes in your cost base? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "This is Shibulal. The pricing environment continues to be stable with an upward bias. For the majority of the new contracts we are seeing about 3% to 4% above our average. On the renegotiations, on the majority of them, we have seen maybe 2% to 3% above our average. And it flows into our revenue productivity. That is how we have seen 5% revenue productivity increase last year and 1% this quarter. ", "Negotiating based purely on rupee appreciation may not be a viable option, because then that in turn will also lead to a negotiation when rupee depreciates. The negotiation has to be based on value, the value which we provide, the overall estimation of compensation and various other factors. And that is what we do on an ongoing basis. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I guess, the customer look at it on an absolute basis in terms of rates they're willing to pay, independent of changes in your relative cost base? ", "S. D. Shibulal", "Our challenge is to move that conversation towards the total cost of ownership and actually have a conversation based on the (inaudible) cost of ownership, the savings which we are delivering, rather than on absolute rates. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "David, just to add to that, it's really based on, as Shibulal said, it's really based on cost increase in India, and overall cost increase in India rather than rupee appreciating. Customers appreciate and see that the costs are going up. They also see that there is a shortage. ", "So, what started as a cost or labor arbitrage is slowly moving to actually availability of talent, availability of capability and things like that throughout the world, not just in India. And we are seeing that there are shortages in the market, in the U.S., etc., which need addressing. And that is why the environment is positive for a rate renegotiation. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see. And maybe, Kris, if you can think about it in the same context of your staffing decisions and the change in the environment, how would you contrast six to nine months ago to today? Is the only change in your staffing decisions and your decisions relative to utilization driven by the rupee and its impact on the margins? Or is there anything else that we should be thinking about that may be impacting those decisions? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, when we look at -- first, let me look at deals, actually. So we are going for growth by and large, but profitable growth. We keep an eye on the margin. And then, when it comes to which type of deals, we are tending to move more towards more value added, more consulting, more operations. So we need both stickiness as well as growth, brand, etcetera. So we're going to trying to have a delicate balance between that. ", "When it comes to staffing, we have now a lot more options because slowly we are growing presence in China. We will be starting a center in Mexico. We have now more presence across the globe in Australia, in U.S., in Toronto in Canada. So we have actually a little bit more flexibility when it comes to staffing. ", "Our business profile has changed from primarily ADM to now 60% ADM. So 42% is non-ADM work, services which we started over the last few years, consulting, package implementation, etcetera. We have more industry knowledge today, industry experts, etcetera, more architects, more design consultants, etcetera. So we are able to actually take on more complex assignments at this point, more transformation type of jobs, etcetera. ", "Recently we won some very interesting contracts in the U.S., where we are helping companies redo their customer interface or redo their audit work and things like that. So, very interesting types of assignments, more business-driven projects and things like that. And staffing will of course change based on that. There will be more consulting people assigned. Even when you look at a BPO deal, actually the first piece of the BPO deal is actually business process reengineering. ", "So the profile of the work is changing. The staffing decisions are changing. The location of staffing is changing, etcetera. So lots of changes have happened in our business. I hope that gives you an idea on your question. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Well, I guess what I was asking is, is that six or nine months ago you were willing to live with a much higher bench and to position yourself for growth. And I guess the question was, is the only change in your decision to lower the bench and increase utilization to offset the impact of the rupee or is there something else that we should be thinking about that underlies that decision? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, David, you know our model. We always shoot for high 70s, low 80s, as the ideal utilization. So we are actually below that right now. We were 73% last quarter. We've gone to 75% now. We're still below the optimum utilization we would like to have. So we still look for a strategic bench because we see growth opportunities in the market. And we want to be ready if we are able to grow faster and things like that. So this increase in utilization is still less than our ideal goal at this point. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see. Okay. Well, thank you very much. ", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So thank you, everyone. We really appreciate you taking time to participate in this call. We look forward to talking to you during the quarter or at the end of next quarter. So, good night and, for some of you, good day. Thank you. ", "Operator", "This concludes today's Infosys Q1 '08 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect. "]}

My name is Cynthia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Results Conference Call for Fiscal 2008 for Infosys Technologies. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn today's call over to Sandeep Mahindroo from Infosys. Please go ahead sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo - Senior Manager - Investor Relations", "Thanks Cynthia. Good morning and welcome everyone to this call to discuss Infosys' financial results for the quarter ending September 30, 2007. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and MD, Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S. D. Shibulal and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan along with other members of the senior management. We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently completed quarter followed by the outlook for the quarter ending September 30, 2007 and year ending March 31, 2008. After that we'll open up the discussion for Q&A.", "Before I pass on to Infosys management, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available at our filings with the SEC which can be found on www.SEC.gov.", "I will now pass on to Infosys management.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Thank you Sandeep and thank you all for participating in this call. Good afternoon, good evening, good morning to each one of you wherever you are. This is the first quarter we have achieved $1 billion dollars in revenue; in that sense, it's a significant milestone for Infosys.", "Growth has been 37%, if you look at the corresponding quarter [ph] last fiscal. We have seen growth across the various industries in which we are operating: banking and capital markets, insurance, retail, manufacturing, energy, utility. So the growth has been very broad. We have seen growth across all the top 25 customers. When you look at it from a 12 month perspective, quarter-upon-quarter, there are some variations. So this quarter, we saw the non-top 10 clients growing faster, much faster than the top 10. But if you look at the last 12 month period, we have seen good growth from all our top clients. We have added 48 new clients this quarter. So our ability to attract new clients to come to us is also very good.", "We have added about 8500 employees gross this quarter. Though we said that we'll add 11,500, what happened was we had to postpone the joining dates for about 2500 to October because our facility was not yet ready. We had some issues with the contractor for completion date. They could not procure cement for completion etcetera. But we will be adding those employees in October and in fact, we are looking at a gross addition of 30,000 employees for the full year. We have improved our margins to 27... operating margins to 27.5%, 2.8% increase from last quarter. So we have actually recovered from what happened in the first quarter because of the rupee appreciation within a very short period of less than a quarter. And that shows the resilience of the model, that shows that we are able to leverage what levers we have in our business in order to sustain a margin and we see margins in a narrow band of 50 to 100 basis points for the remainder of the fiscal and our philosophy of having one of the highest margins in this industry continues to be a goal for Infosys.", "We have revised our guidance for the rest of the year. When we started the year, we started with 29% to 30%, then we increased it to 30% to 31% and now we are seeing a growth of 34.5% to 35% for the full year. That's almost... for 5% increase in our guidance for the full fiscal year.", "So with this, let me hand it over to Shibulal to give you more information on how the revenues segmented and things like that.", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer and Member of the Board", "So this is Shibulal. Thank you for joining the call. As Kris said, we have crossed $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter. It's a major milestone for Infosys. Our sequential growth was 10.1%. Out of that, the volume growth contributed 7.7% and revenue productivity growth contributed 1.9%. Now we have seen overall growth in almost all segments. The BFSI segment, which is our largest segment, has grown 11.4%; manufacturing grew 13.2%, all this is quarter-on-quarter; retail grew 27.3% quarter-on-quarter; energy and utility segment grew 19.5% quarter-on-quarter. If you look at services, package implementation, consulting has grown. Consulting is now 5%; what we call two [ph] consulting is 5% and the package implementation, which includes... which is also consulting oriented is 18.7%. It has gone... last quarter it was 18.4%. So our total consulting revenue, if you look at it in the industry standard rate, today is 24%. $241 million of revenue we derived from consulting this quarter. Our Independent Validation Services has grown 13.6% quarter-on-quarter.", "Again, giving some color on the revenue, our fixed price has gone up by a couple of basis... couple of 100 basis points to reach 31.5%. Our on-site has remained stable, marginally decreased from last quarter and it is 31.7% in Q2.", "Our revenue productivity has gone up 1.9% blended. 2.9% on-site revenue productivity increased, 2.6% offshore revenue productivity increase, which has led to a 1.9% blended revenue productivity increase. It's very interesting; this is a sixth quarter in which we have revenue productivity increase. The last six quarters we have had continuous revenue productivity increase. Last year, we had gained 5%... 4.7% or so year-on-year revenue productivity increase.", "We have... the billing rate continued to be stable with an upward bias. New clients, new contracts are coming at around 3% to 4% higher than our average. Contract renegotiations are also coming at 2% to 3% above average.", "Our growth is all around. The top 10 customers grew by 2.7% quarter-on-quarter, but if you look at it on a year-to-year basis, you will see strong growth in the top 10 customers. Non-top 10 grew 13.7% sequentially.", "As Kris said, we added 48 new customers this quarter. The total number of clients is 520. Number of $1 million clients have also gone up. Last quarter it was 285; this quarter it is 295, 295 clients, giving us more than $1 million per year. 16 clients contribute more than $50 million of revenue on the LTM basis, 5 more than 90 and three more than 100. Fortune 500 clients, we have 113. This quarter, out of the 48 clients which we added, 3 of them were Fortune 500. Our DSO has remained stable; actually it has come down to 55 days compared with 67 days last quarter. Out of the DSO, 80.9% of our DSO is less than 30 days.", "Utilization has gone up from last quarter to this quarter. It will reach 79.5%. Last quarter it was 75.1%. But the other number to notice is utilization including trainees, which is at a very healthy rate of 71.2%. This means that we have enough capacity in training, which will take care of our growth requirements for the coming quarter.", "As Kris said, we will be recruiting 30,000 people this year, including the Phillips lift out of 1400 people. We have given salary increase of 12% to 15% offshore and 5% to 6% on-site effective April 1st. The salary increase has been neutralized using the number of labors we have and our margins have up by 280 basis points in dollar terms.", "Our visa utilization is at a healthy rate of 67%. Our subsidiaries are doing well. Our American [ph] subsidiary is doing well. China and Consulting continues to be in investment mode. China has 650 employees. Infosys Consulting has 236 and we have a new subsidiary in Mexico. We have opened a center in Mexico and that has 27 employees as of this quarter.", "We have 3400 plus employees including consulting and package implementation which is contributing 24% of the revenue.", "With that, let me hand over to Bala to give color to the financial statement.", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Hi. This quarter we have seen revenues growing by around 10.1% sequentially. We crossed $1 billion in revenues. Our gross margin went up to 42.2% from 38.7% last quarter. The operating income gone up to 27.5% from 24.7% last quarter. We have seen improvement in operating margin of 2.8%, which basically came in because the visa cost, which was around $16 million in the first quarter, has come down to $3.5 million because there was a window of opportunity to apply for H1 visas in the first quarter. That contributed positively to the margin by around 1.2%. The G&A cost came down by around 90 basis points. Because of the bill rate increase of 1.9% on blended basis, we got a positive impact on margin of 1.1%.", "Rupee impacted the margin by around 50 basis points. It was appreciated by 1.2% during the quarter. So net-net, the net operating margin went up to around 2.8%.", "The effective tax rate slightly went up this quarter. Last quarter, we had a tax reversal of $13 million. If you normalize that, the effective tax rate last quarter was 13.9%. This quarter it went to 15.1% basically because we had seen some improvement in the profits on-site. In all the countries we operate, we do pay taxes and the tax rate has gone up because of that.", "We had given a guidance of $0.46 as EPS. We had done $0.48. We have seen good growth all around, and in terms of guidance, we had increased our guidance for the full year. We are saying the revenues could grow somewhere between 34.5% to 35% for the whole year, but the earnings per share could grow somewhere between 29.4% to 30.1%. If you exclude the tax reversal, which you had done last year and what you had done in the first quarter of this year, the effective tax and [ph] EPS could grow somewhere between 32% to 33%.", "We had assumed the bill rate to be similar to what you have seen in the second quarter for rest of the year. We assume the currency to be at 39.5 for the next six months. We have not assumed any large deals in the guidance. We have not assumed any price increase in the guidance from what we have seen in the second quarter. We also assume that the utilization could be somewhere between 76% to 80%. We have seen the utilization slightly going up this quarter, but when you add more people in the next two quarters, it could come within the band of 76% to 80%, more closer to the lower end of the band.", "So, overall, we have seen strong growth in all areas. We had improved our margins in spite of the currency going against us. We had increased the guidance for the whole year. The momentum for revenue growth continues.", "I think with this, I will conclude my presentation. We'll open up the floor for Q&A. Thank you.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery", "Hi gentlemen and nice quarter, nice execution this quarter. I know you talked about a little bit about this in the Indian conference call, but I wonder if you could just talk about what you are seeing as far as budgeting and spending on IT services heading into next year.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Hi. This is Kris here. Currently, we are seeing that, for this year it will continue to... it is probably it is continued to spend on IT. In fact, some analysts are even saying that this year's expenses and this year's spend is higher than last year than our 8% or so. And the reason... some of the reasons we see are because company's wants to expand into newer markets, especially developing markets etcetera, they are spending in technology, they are spending in acquisition, mergers etcetera, and that is one of the reasons why this spend is going up. Now for next year, it will all depend on how the budgets are set in the first quarter. In the past, we have seen that offshore benefits disproportionately because company's transition was to offshore continuously and offshore has become mainstream today. So, overall, the environment seems to be positive with no signs of slow down, maybe slight uptick and definitely trend towards offshore.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery", "Have you seen anything on the discretionary spending side of things?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "In fact, if you look at our consulting package, implementation, consulting etcetera, these services are growing. So we are not really seeing any slowdown on the discretionary spend also. Most of the investments into newer geographies, newer areas and innovation. There is a lot of interest in things like RFID, grid computing, Software as a Service. So there is investment happening in innovation, discretion etcetera.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery", "Okay. And just one last final question here, have you guys taken a look at any implications from the expiration of the tax holiday and anything that we could... and what that would do to your tax rate heading into '09 and any indication that what would happen politically as far as that tax holiday going away? Thanks guys.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "As it stands today, we have the social economic zones in some of the centers already operational and, in other centers, we are in the process of getting all the approvals and setting it up. So we will have most of our incremental growth coming up in SEZs. As the STP scheme comes to an end in 2009, you will see an increase in our tax... effective tax rate right now around 14%, it may go up to 20%, 21% as is today... see today. But if you are able to accelerate the growth in the SEZs, it may be even lower than that, and then it will continue to dip. I will... and from a political side of course, the industry is looking at support from the government to continue the tax holiday. We will have to wait and see what the response from the government will be. I will let Bala add if he has anything to add.", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "See, as of now, the loss trend [ph], the tax holiday could go off in 2010, but we have to wait and see because there could be a new government in place in 2010, and we have to see what they are going to do. But as of now, the law is the tax holiday could go off. Our effective tax rate today is somewhere between 13.5% to 14.5%. If the tax holiday goes off, it could go off to may be around 20%, 22%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equity Research.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Thank you and again, congratulations on very, very good execution here. Two questions. First is we are getting some data points that avionics industries, the verticals, is having some increased traction with Indian IT services companies. I was wondering what kind of services can Infosys be providing to the avionic sector. And the second question I have is regarding setting up more businesses, or Infosys offices in rural India. I was wondering, do you have any specific locations where you are looking into setting up new offices? Thanks, and again, congratulations on very good execution.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So we have actually a broad range of services for the aircraft industry, traditional application development, maintenance, consulting. We do engineering services, we do embedded systems work, product development work. As you know, we are working with the two major aircraft manufacturing companies. There is also an opportunity for companies in India through the Offset Program. Infosys is one of the companies who is approved for the Offset... for participating in the Offset Program, and that could also be an opportunity for us. So we have good set of services, good opportunities in the aircraft industry.", "To the second question, Infosys is today in four tier-1, what we call tier-1 cities, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune and actually six tier-2 cities: Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhubaneshwar, Mysore, Mangalore, Trivandrum etcetera. So we are looking at tier-2 cities as we expand. We do like to look at tier-2 and tier-3 cities. We don't want to speculate on any other new locations because then that would create problems for us and it could actually create speculation. So we would just leave it. We would look at tier-2 cities as we grow.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks guys. As we kind of look forward and think about where utilization is currently trending right now, what do you think is the opportunity for utilization as you kind of think about the sequential trend in utilization, especially as we think about sort of two factors: one, utilization as it relates as a revenue driver and two, utilization as a potential offset to continued rupee appreciation?", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer and Member of the Board", "Well, utilization is at a very healthy rate right now, 79.5%. We are quite comfortable with 76% to 80%. We have seen more than 80% in the past occasionally, 81%, 82%. If you take it on a healthy level, that will impact our ability to grow, because we need the supply chain to grow as well as to take advantage of any opportunities which will come around. And so I believe, and as Bala said, now we have a large number of people in training. If you look at our utilization including trainees, it is only 71.2%. So once the trainees get released into the system, the utilization will remain within that band of 76% to 80% for the next couple of quarters. And Bala will add to that.", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "See, utilization, we always said we are comfortable with... within a band of 76% to 80%. It has gone up slightly this quarter, but when you begin the year, we always want to end up with a utilization which is somewhere to the closer to lower end of the band because we want to have enough flexibility in the model to make sure the growth is there when you see market opportunities. To some extent, our utilization is a function of the market demand we see and is a function of the demand environment.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then Bala, one thing I wanted to ask was the... and I noted the sequential uptick in fixed price work relative to time and materials work. When, just in terms of the way that they are working, is sort of accounted for. I know that the unit contribution for those two is about the same, but when should we expect to see margin benefits from increase in exposure to fixed price or are we already starting to see it?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Actually, the fixed price has gone up this quarter, which is our strategic direction to increase our fixed price. If we can increase our fixed price and execute them at a higher productivity level, the result of that will be value accrual towards Infosys. So we are focused on the fixed price. We have come up with... we have a separate tool and use group now for the last 12 months. They are very much active and focused on increasing productivity. So by increase in fixed price and if we increase productivity in the fixed price projects, we will have the value extraction towards Infosys. And our fixed price today is higher than our average margin by 3% to 4%.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company.", "Moshe Katri - SG Cowen", "Thanks. There seemed to be a disconnect between what Kris was saying about... what you were seeing Kris about demand trends versus your December quarterly guidance, especially in terms of sequential revenue growth. And I mean, I'm just curious, obviously, your stock has been down pretty aggressively in India. It's opening... it's probably going to open down again today. Seemed to be mostly on concerns over your guidance. Are you... in your guidance, do you want us to... do you feel that the takeaway from this call should be that Infosys is cautious about the spending outlook for December or Infosys is being conservative? What do you think we should kind of conclude from this, because the clearly the market is taking a stand here about in terms of what they are understanding from the numbers? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So we have clearly said that we are not seeing any slow down. Of course, January is when the budgets are reset. So next year, we will have to wait and see. But we are not seeing any slow down. We have seen broad growth across the various industries. See, we give guidance based on what we see. We have a method to how we do guidance etcetera, and we base it on that. We also make sure that we have slack in the system so that if we see opportunities in the market, we are able to take a full advantage of that and grow faster than that. And so basically, the guidance is based on what we see in the market today and what we see. We have revised our guidance for the entire year to 34.5% to 35%. And Q3 typically is slightly slower, so that's also reflect.", "Moshe Katri - SG Cowen", "But Kris --?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "No, no, I'll answer the question. The difference between the two markets is the Indian market looks at the Indian rupee guidance, and the rupee has appreciated, the volumes are higher than the growth in the EPS in rupees in India. Whereas I guess you folks look at the U.S. dollar guidance, even though you look at the markets in India. And if you look at comparables in the U.S., 35% growth in the top line and near that in EPS growth for a year among comparables in the United States is something that people compare with to see how well you are growing. Whereas in India, they look at 20% because the rupee has appreciated and they said that it's not the same like last year. So I think the currency is a live fact between the two markets and that's how people see it differently.", "Moshe Katri - SG Cowen", "I am talking more about the fact that, sequentially, your growth this quarter was about 10% or so. And your guiding for a deceleration in sequential growth of 5% to 6% in the December quarter, and this is without even factoring some sort of a wage... some sort of a... or bill rate increase, so if... in this quarter, it was about 1.9%, so assuming you will get another 1% for the December quarter, then we are really talking about 4% to 5% sequential growth and then we are really talking about a deceleration. So, I think we are looking at the pure sequential revenue growth numbers, and I don't think it really has to anything with the Indian rupee. And that's why... that's what my question was about.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "No, no it's not really so. If you look at the last few years, you had always seen the third and fourth quarter to be soft quarters because third quarter there are a lot of holidays, fourth quarter, the first quarter when the clients finalize their budget and start spending. You are talking about the larger base also, right? So if you look at even Q3 of '06 or even Q3 of '05, the growth has been slower in the third and fourth quarter as compared to first and second quarter. What the Indian markets focus on is the rupee growth, not the dollar growth. We are seeing great momentum in the business. 35% growth in revenues is a great achievement in this kind of environment with a base of $3 billion. This year we'll be ending at $4 billion. So I don't think... the markets are looking at two different numbers and coming to different conclusion, but if you look at the momentum in the business, if you look at the growth, I think 10% growth in a quarter and 35% growth in a year is a great growth.", "Moshe Katri - SG Cowen", "Okay, that's fair. So you are talking about seasonality. And then just briefly, the question is for Mohan. The hiring for the quarter was a bit light, maybe you can talk a bit in detail about what's going on in Mysore and talk about your hiring targets for fiscal '08. Thanks.", "T.V. Mohandas Pai - Member of the Board and Director-Human Resources", "In the guidance given at the end of the first quarter, we had said that we'll have 11,000-odd people joining us this quarter. 8500 have joined. We had challenges in Mysore because infrastructure for training did not come up to speed; they were delayed by three months because the contractors defaulted in completion and there is a cement shortage in India. It sounds funny for me to say this, but it is true. So the people who were supposed to join in the second and third quarter September are now going to join in the first and second quarter, the first and second week of October. So we got about... the offers are there. They are all from the colleges and they are joining now, some of them have already joined. So I think we are okay. Will it impact our business for this year? No. Because we have 5200 people in training, a large number of them are coming off training and joining delivery in this month, so the people who are supposed to join us in our last two weeks of September were the people who will come off training sometime in January. And we have enough people to work and to make sure that we have enough slack in the system by the time we end this financial year. We have increased the guidance for number of hires from 26,000 to 30,000; 26,000 at the end of the first quarter to 30,000 now. Out of the increase of 4000, 1500 are acquired through the Philips's deal and the balance 2500, organically, we would like to hire from the marketplace. We got a recruitment team in place. This year we'll be hiring 30,000 people as against 31,000-odd we did last year. So actually increase in the hiring.", "Moshe Katri - SG Cowen", "Great, thanks. Thanks for the clarification. Finally, just brief comment. Mohan, may be you can talk a bit about your outlook for wage hikes on an ongoing basis? We spoke about this very briefly in July and then since then we continue to see all kind of different media outlooks out of India talking about a potential moderation in wage hikes down the road. Is this something that Infosys sees and what's your view on that? Thanks.", "T.V. Mohandas Pai - Member of the Board and Director-Human Resources", "Well, we do believe at this point of time that the wage hikes for next year will be in the range of 12% to 15% same as this year or the year before that. We do not see any signs of moderation for many reasons. One, the offers for freshers for the next year is already out. We already made 18,000 offers. Other companies have made their offers, and there is already a hike in the freshers' compensation by about 8% to 10%. And right now when you look at hiring in their lateral level, in the middle level, you see the wages going up. So next year definitely will be 12% to 15% as we see it at this point of time, and we do not see any moderation. Remember it is not only the IT industry that's hiring in India; it is the whole Indian industry hiring in India. Unless growth rates in India comes down significantly, there will be no let up in hiring. Do we see it going up more than this at this point of time? No. We are comfortable with this range. And following the 12% to 15% hike in salaries in April or March would mean a 7% to 8% increase in per capita salary cost for the whole year compared to the previous year because of the pyramidical structure that we have built. So we are quite comfortable with what we are doing and I think we are okay.", "Moshe Katri - SG Cowen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Marostica with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Marostica - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you and nice job on the quarter. Obviously, your offshore mix has been increasing over a number of quarters; this quarter jumped up over 68%. I am curious as to number one, what you see as potentially a practical limit to your offshore mix? And secondly, if could comment on the relative margin differential on-site versus offshore effort. Thanks?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So we are comfortable with about 30% onshore and 70% offshore. But it is actually not the same across all the service lines we offer. So, for example, enterprise solutions, which started off as mostly onshore, almost all onshore, today has only 40% onshore and 60% offshore. So we tried to actually bring more efficiency. It's a win-win scenario for both Infosys and the client in the sense that the client sees lower cost and we see higher margins. So for the second part of your question on the margin improvement, typically, the margins are almost double when we deliver the work from offshore.", "Mark Marostica - Piper Jaffray", "Great. And then I wanted to ask a question on the retail segment. You had a real solid result this quarter. Is that being driven by retailers who are seeing some sluggishness pushing more work offshore? And maybe if you can comment prospectively, are you sensing any hesitancy among your retail clients as you kind of look at their budgets coming up for this year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So retail for us is a global business and we saw good growth of retail in Europe. We have acquired new clients in retail in Europe, so that's partly the reason. So some of the new clients who have come in are in retail segment. And so client to client... no, sorry, for the same client, the growth as you said may not be as much, but across the world and across the total business, we are seeing good growth in retail. What is happening is retail companies are now looking at offshore more aggressively and trying to leverage this model as they see the environment becoming more global and environment requiring more efficiency from them.", "Mark Marostica - Piper Jaffray", "And then last question, I'll turn it over, attrition ticked up this quarter. Can you give us a sense for some of the drivers that impacted this quarter?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "This quarter on an LTM basis, we had 14.2% as against 13.7%. We made an analysis of this 0.5% increase. Out of 0.5%, 0.37% is due to the increase in the people who left us for higher education. We had 1300 people LTM leaving us for higher education as against 970 same time previous year. And if you look at this quarter versus the last quarter, there is an uptick in the number of people who left us for higher education because this is the season for MBA courses and M.Tech courses. And the number of people who left us in the month of August and September is down from the number of people who left us in July. July, we had a spike, and the spike because of people leaving us. So I think we are quite comfortable. If you remove the numbers about from involuntary attrition, we are at 12.8% out of 14.2%. And if you remove the number of people who leave for higher education, I think we are very comfortable at about 10.5% or so currently that's okay because only about 43% of the total people who leave us in a year leave us to join other companies, and that ratio has been almost the same for the last three years.", "Mark Marostica - Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Hey it's again Rod Bourgeois here. Mohan, I just wanted to follow up. We spoke of on the earlier conference call some about the attrition. I wanted to follow up on that point a little bit. The quarterly attrition, as annualize the quarterly rate, it looks like it jumped up to a little over 17% to the meaningful uptick. And it would also suggest mathematically that your LTM or your last twelve months attrition rate over the next couple of quarters did continue to rise. Is that the right way to look at it or is something going to happen to stem the tide on that in the next couple of quarters?", "T.V. Mohandas Pai - Member of the Board and Director-Human Resources", "Well, we had 2700 people leave us in the services this quarter as against 2100-odd people who left us in the previous year, out of which we had about, I think if I remember rightly, about 700 people leave us in August and about 750 or 800 leave us in September. So it's been constant for the last two months, and the spike was in July and we had a spike in June. So June, July are the times when people leave us for higher education. If you net that out and look at it LTM and look at an annualized basis and look at it in a quarterly basis, it has come down. So I think net of this spike, I think we are quite comfortable. We have not seen a spike in people leaving us for compensation or for joining other companies. And I think... but what is interesting is the number of people who leave us for high education is increasing. I guess people have an aspiration that after working two or three years, they want to do an MBA degree. And people are always fascinated by MBA, and that's the spike. So apart for that, we don't see any other spike. So to the extent, I think we are... we are quite comfortable. I think it is under control.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "But isn't that a trend that could continue and if so, the math would suggest that your LTM attrition could go up in the next couple of quarters?", "T.V. Mohandas Pai - Member of the Board and Director-Human Resources", "Well, it all depends on how we stabilize in October, November and December.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Yes.", "T.V. Mohandas Pai - Member of the Board and Director-Human Resources", "Because the trend has been down in the sense there is a spike LTM and if you take LTM up to July, it is up, then it came down in August and September if you take LTM. So if it remains the same pace in August and September for this month to the next two months, I think it will come... it's also coming down, so we'll see some stability.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "But you don't view this as a new sort of challenge to deal with from a wage inflation perspective or just a ongoing ability to manage the supply part of the equation? Are you viewing this as a new challenge that's meaningful or kind of a relatively minor issue as you manage the supply side?", "T.V. Mohandas Pai - Member of the Board and Director-Human Resources", "Well, people leaving us is always a challenge. You'd prefer they stayed back with us and build our careers, because it is always good to have great people working for you. And as always, you spend more money and effort trying to recruit from outside to fill the bridge because there are people leaving you. We prefer not... for people not to leave us. But we have to accept the reality, how it is that there are... there is opportunity here for in the local industries, India is growing at a very fast pace. So to an extent people would leave us. The challenge is to keep it within reasonable limits, which you can afford and manage. Is it hurting us in getting fresh talent from the marketplace? No, because our hiring of laterals has gone up and the lateral conversion rate has gone up compared to the previous year. So that is exciting. And even from the colleges, the supply is up. The challenge at the fresher level today in India is not the supply, it's an ability to hire and train people. They are all trainable people, you need to train, you need to invest in training, and that is a challenge. And we have built up the capacity, we could train 40,000 people a year in Mysore. Across the company, we have a system, we have a capacity to train 50,000 people a year and we could house all of them for up to four months in our campuses all over. So the cost of training is significantly less at any other corporation in the world. So I think we have built competitive advantages and we have taken steps to neutralize this.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Great, thanks for that. And I then the margin performance under those circumstances has been clearly impressive. On the earlier conference call, you guys indicated that discretionary spending could see some slowdown at certain clients that have a credit card business. And I was wondering if you could quantify what percentage of your client base might fall into that category of potentially having a slowdown because of credit-related issues.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "If you are looking for the exposure that we have for companies that are in the mortgage business, it's about 0.5%, actually less than 0.5%. While also on a credit card basis, we are actually not seeing any slow down in our credit card clients. But we do... we are seeing some amount of provisioning that they are doing. So we think that they may be anticipating some kind of a slowdown as a result of the perceived adoption in the welfare side [ph] because housing prices start falling down. But all our conversations with our clients, we have not seen any reduction in any spend/budget or any cancellation of projects.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Right. But it sounds like beyond the 0.5% that's exposed to mortgages, there is slightly larger clients base that might be provisioning for some slowing discretionary spending. Can you quantify how big that additional client base is beyond the mortgage client?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well all our clients... I mean you've seen the results that they have come out with are providing for something either because they are taking a charge off. Everybody has come clean, which is good, come clean in terms of what they are MBS or AVS portfolios are. In terms of being able to pinpoint the discretionary spend with these clients, it's all... I mean it varies from client to client. But clearly, in our conversations with our clients, we have actually not seen them talk about any cancellation, delays or deferrals of any kind of a project, whether discretionary, semi-discretionary or pure license [ph] as of today.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "All right. So would you be surprised if there was a meaningful slowdown in discretionary spending that affected your growth outlook over the next couple of quarters?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hard to say in terms of whether there really will be one. We are attracting and modeling all the macroeconomic indicators. We do not believe that there is any systemic risk out there. We do not believe there are any hidden surprises. But there will definitely be some amount of delaying for projects which could be done later on. So from that perspective, yes, we could see some discretionary spend getting deferred. But we again, to reiterate, we have not seen any of that, and neither in our conversations with our clients have we heard them mentioning it. But in this particular space, we are watching it very, very closely and we are in constant dialogue with our clients and we are modeling what we see and hear in order to see the impact it will have on their business as well as consequently on their IT spend in our business.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Thanks for the help for the extra color guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Julie Santoriello with Morgan Stanley.", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Could you talk about the outlook for pricing bill rates for next year? It's been a nice positive, nice challenge for you this year. Do you think that kind of increase in bill rates can continue for next year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So it is probably too early to talk about next year. We have two more quarters. We have seen six quarters of increased per capita income for the company; this quarter 1.9%. The trend is positive. We are seeing that 3% to 4% increase in new contracts and about 2% to 3% when contracts come up for renewal; not all of them, at least some of them. So the trend is positive. Clients realize that costs are going up in India. Of course, they would benchmark it with inflation rates and things like that in the country in which they are operating rather than India. But we are seeing consistently that 2%, 3%, 4% is possible. And then the way we have constructed the model, Mohan talked about 12% to 15% increase in compensation in India. That is about 16%, 17% of our revenue, overall revenue. And effectively, and over the year Mohan also told that it comes down to about 7%. So if you look at the effective impact of compensation increase, it comes down to about approximately... it comes down to approximately 1% or 1.5%. And that is something which we can absorb because we are seeing that revenue per employee, the per capita income per employee is going up, and that's why the model is resilient and model is able to sustain the margins we have.", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, that's really helpful. If I could also ask you if we do see a general slowdown in the global economy and we could begin to become more concerned about budgets, customer budgets for next year, which parts of your business would you be most concerned about? I mean do you think you would see it first in the ITO business or the BPO business?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "See, the BPO business is much smaller. So we are not seeing any slowdown, but if there is... the rest of the company can easily absorb. The BPO business dynamics is also very different. They are in several conversations already, several deals already. And I don't know whether those will get pulled back at this point, because most of the reasons for looking at offshore is actually improvement in efficiency, reduction in cost etcetera. And if there is a slowdown, there will only be an acceleration of move to offshore. And when it comes to IT outsourcing, the primary driver has moved to offshore rather than IT spending. The primary driver for our growth is the move to offshore, and that I think continues to be strong. This has become the mainstream model for even global system integrators, the number of employees in India is growing. So everybody sees that the opportunity for the future is really leveraging the GDM model and offshore should continue to increase. We see this same from other analysts, that is technology analysts, we see this in the NASSCOM-McKinsey Report where they are predicting that the industry should continue to grow at 25% to 30%. And in that growth, the larger companies are seeing disproportionate share of that growth.", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "Makes sense. And just lastly, can you comment on your appetite for acquisitions right now, and particularly if acquisitions will be necessary to expand geographically? Thank you.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Acquisitions can accelerate our entry into a market, acquisition can fill a gap in the services footprint we have, acquisitions can help us become a larger player in the consulting business etcetera. So acquisitions definitely is important for us. Now having said that, you know the history of acquisitions is that 85% of acquisitions do not deliver the value they are supposed to deliver. So we are careful in selecting the companies. We have certain parameters which we look for in terms of strategic fit, overlap of business, overlap of clients' ability to retain employees and the profitability of the business, valuation, the values, culture, ethics, how we can integrate both the organizations. So we look at many of these parameters, and if we find some company which fits these and of course they need... they would... they should want to be acquired. We are not looking at a hostile takeover or something like that. So they should want to be acquired. And then you will see Infosys doing an acquisition. There is another kind of acquisition, which is participating in outsourcing deals like the Philips deal, and you will see Infosys becoming active, more active in that space also. So you will see two kinds of acquisitions from Infosys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with Bear Stearns.", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. If you had met your hiring plans for the September quarter, do you think revenue growth would have been higher? In other words, the couple of weeks shift out of people coming on board, do you think that constrained revenue growth in this September quarter in any way?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "No. We had enough people in the system to possibly grow 3% to 4% more.", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Okay. So when you look back at the September quarter, the 7.7% volume growth, is it fair to say the constraint to growth would be demand, not supply?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Absolutely. Especially for us.", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks. Actually, just to expand on Andrew's question. I mean it looks like on a year-over-year basis, you weren't [ph] capacity constrained, but unit growth decelerated to about 28% year-over-year and had been in the low to mid 30s. And I was wondering if you could just help us understand, at least from your perspective, how we should view that. And then secondly, if you could perhaps relate that, I think, you said also that your gross headcount adds would be up maybe 1000 people year-over-year, but essentially flat. So, perhaps you could kind of relate what you are seeing on the unit growth side also to what you are doing on the headcount side. Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "David, see, we model the business for a particular growth rate based on how we see the business. And to a certain extent, that is also a limit to our growth. We provide for slack. As you know, 77% to 81%, a 4 % improvement in utilization for a quarter or so is possible, is sustainable. And you saw a perfect example of that in this quarter where we had budgeted certain growth rate, but we grew much faster. And of course we will help with an increase in per capita income also. So the way we look at our business is that we want steady, consistent, performance and growth and sometimes some clients grow faster. We do get surprised because of that. But the duty is that we are able to take advantage of that and grow the business. That's what typically happens. Other than that, there is no slow down or anything like that, and the business is a planned growth business.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "So you wouldn't view the 28% year-over-year growth as a deceleration or just lumpiness in your model?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Yes.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see. And I guess looking at the margins, in terms of the dynamic between pricing, mix and utilization, could you give us some relative weights on how important those three items, each of those three items, were in terms of driving the realization rates up in the quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "No, no, we had to use some of the levers, or all the levers at some point of time. Pricing is good because any 1% increase in pricing, it will have a impact on margins by around 60 basis points. Utilization could give a benefit of 40 basis points. Scale benefits, we have to see. It could be somewhere between 50 to 60 basis points. So I think all those levers are very important, but we may chose to use some of them or all of them at some point of time.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "But I think you said that utilization will be coming down sequentially as you hire and bring in these incremental hires. So to hold the margins within your 50 basis point band, what are the levers that are going to allow you to do that with utilization coming down in the second half of the year?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "What we said was we always want the utilization to be within the band of 76 to 80, closer to the year. Probably, we will try to bring it down to the lower end of the band. If the utilization probably goes down, say, by around 2%, probably it will have an impact of around 80 basis points. So you can get some lever out of the G&A cost and also the on-site/offshore mix coupled with some increase in pricing.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see. And one last question about the other income. It looked like it was down more than I would have anticipated even with the more stable rupee. Was there any other dynamic probably [ph] going on there in terms of rates or anything else that would have impacted that number sequentially?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "No, I think it was basically because of the yield, and last quarter the average yield was something around 11.5%, 12% on the money we deployed. This quarter, it has come down to around 7.5%, 8% because there is enough liquidity in the banking system. So generally, interest rates have come down. And last quarter we also had a ForEx benefit of around $17 million. This quarter, it's not there because the rupee again appreciated from the base. Otherwise, I don't think there is any other plan.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And just one last thing on the tax rate. So if we look out in the second half of the year to kind of hit the 13.5% to 14.5%, does that mean the tax rate comes down in the second half of the year from the 15% level?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it has gone up to 15% in the second quarter because the on-site profitability has gone up, because last quarter we had a visa cost coming in; this quarter, we don't have that. It could be normalized in the next two quarters. Probably, it will be somewhere between the 13.5% to 14.5% range.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Is that for the second half of the year or for the year in its entirety?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Both for the second half of the year and the full year.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see. Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ashish Thadani with Gilford Securities.", "Ashish Thadani - Gilford Securities", "Yes, good evening, nice quarter. Your operating margin was relatively unchanged from a year ago at about 28% despite the 13% rupee appreciation, which would be about 600 basis points impact. Question is where has this 600 basis points been made up and how much more cushion do you see?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "No, it has been basically made up from the higher billing rates we had seen. Last quarter, we have seen the billing rates... I mean the first quarter we had seen the billing rates going up by around 1.1%. This quarter again, it went up by 1.9%. The utilization in the beginning was around 73, 74; it has gone up to 78. And we got some benefit on the G&A side because of the scale. So it's a combination of all the three, which helped us to offset the impact of the rupee.", "Ashish Thadani - Gilford Securities", "So it's basically these three items, right? These are the three major items that would offset the entire rupee appreciation year-on-year?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "You're right. These are the three major items which helped us offset the impact, yes.", "Ashish Thadani - Gilford Securities", "And would you have a finer breakdown of how these three, what they were in terms of relative impact?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, we can take it offline because last year also we had said what are the levers we use. Probably we can take it offline.", "Ashish Thadani - Gilford Securities", "Sure. Okay. Thank you.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Thank you all very much. Really appreciate all of you taking time off to interact with us. We look forward to talking to you all during the quarter or at the end of next quarter and have a good day. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's second quarter results conference call for fiscal 2008 for Infosys Technologies. You may now disconnect."]}

We also saw that ournet income over the last four quarters has crossed a $1 billion and also last12 months basis, net income is over a $1billion, and Europealso has crossed a $1 billion on a last 12-month basis.", "We saw significant customeradditions. We saw significant wins, about nine large multi-year, multi-serviceprojects. And then if you look at the various industry verticals, we saw growthin BCM, Banking and Capital Markets, telecom, manufacturing.", "All our parameters regardingcustomers saw growth in terms of million dollar customers, $10 million, $50million, $100 million. And overall, we've not seen any cancellations ofprojects, slowdown. We have seen rate increases, seven quarters of consistentimprovement in revenue per employee of about on an average 1 percentage point. Thisquarter it was 0.8%.", "So, all in all, the environmentseems to be positive. We have also told ourclients. They have been telling us that offshore would continue to increase.They will invest in moving projects to offshore and things like that. The trendseems to continue.", "The only concern or maybe areawhere we are watching is how do the budgets for next year look like. Most ofthe budgets should have been typically completed by now, but we are seeing somecustomers at least delaying it to the end of the month or early part ofFebruary when they will share it with us. So, that's the only data, which we'llhave to wait for -- which we are waiting for. Even where the budgets have beenclosed or completed, on an average we are seeing 6% increase in our IT budgetsfor calendar year 2008 and also continuing to get a higher proportion of thisgrowth. So, that trend continues.", "So, all-in-all, a good quarterimprovement in operating margin, growth in customers, growth in the variousindustry verticals, growth in various geographies, and a quarter which was asexpected, Q3 and Q4 are slow quarters, and so we had expected this and we'vedone slightly better than what we expected.", "Now, I am going to pass it on tomy colleague, Shibulal, to talk about more about the industry verticals andthings like that.", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer", "Good morning, this is Shibulal.As Kris said, we have seen strong growth all around. Our top five customershave grown by 19%, top 10 by 16% and top 25 by 9.3% sequentially. Moreimportantly, the BFSI segment has grown ahead of the company average. Also, theTelecom segment has grown ahead of the company average. As far as the demandand revenue is concerned, we are not seeing any change at this point in the ITspending environment as of right now.", "Most of the clients whom we talkto, continue to be bullish about increasing their offshore IT spend withintheir overall IT budget. This quarter we have signed a multiple, multi-milliondollar, multi-year contract. If I am right, I believe we have signed nine suchcontracts this quarter. Most of them between $50 million to $100 million range.", "The pricing environment continuesto be stable with an upward bias. Our new clients are coming at around 3% to 4%above company average. Pricing and existing client contracts when renegotiatedfor most part are coming around 2% to 3% above company average. This hasresulted in constant increase in the revenue productivity. As Kris said, therevenue productivity has gone up quarter-on-quarter for the last sevenquarters, almost an average of 1%. This quarter it has moved up by another0.8%.", "Europe isgrowing ahead of the company average. This quarter it is 28.6% of our revenue.Even in the BFSI segment, we have seen pricing increase with couple of ourclients, when we renegotiated. We have a good pipeline for large deals. At anypoint in time, we track about 12 to 18 deals, and these deals are long-term,long incubation deals. They take anywhere between three to four quarters toclose, and we have a good pipeline.", "As Kris said, we are seeingdelays in closing of the client budgets in some of our clients, and we expectthem to close in Feb. We would get a clearer picture once all the budgets areclosed.", "From an expansion perspective --from a geographical expansion perspective, we are investing in Australiaand Japan.Interestingly in Japan,this quarter we signed a deal, infrastructure management deal, a multi-million,multi-year deal. Australiais also a good market for us. And from a vertical perspective, we are investingmore into verticals like Life Sciences, Pharma, Services, which are yieldingresults.", "From a client perspective, wehave added 47 new clients this quarter, 4 of them are Fortune 500. The numberof million dollar clients have gone up from 295 to 305. Our repeat business is96%. So there is enough potential in our client base to mine the existingrelationships.", "From a service perspective, wehave added couple of services in the last few months. First one is software andservice. We have a platform from social computing which we are taking tomarket. There is a pipeline and we have closed one deal. Second one is learningservice, which is just out in the market. We have a pipeline but no deals havebeen closed.", "Overall, we have seen stronggrowth in our existing clients. The demand continues to be robust and thepricing at this point is stable with an upward bias.", "Thank you very much. And let menow hand it over to Bala.", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning. It's great talkingto you again. We had a great quarter. Our revenues were $1.084 billion. It'sincreased by 6.1% sequentially. Gross margin was at 42%. Operating marginsslightly increased. It was 27.5% last quarter. This quarter it went up to 28.7%.", "We had three one-off eventsduring this quarter. The first one was the settlement we made in California.We did a one-time voluntary settlement with the statutory authorities there foraround $26 million. That impacted the margin by around 2.4%. This is relatingto the past few years and the wages could be paid to the employees in duecourse.", "The second one was a reversal ofinsurance costs. We have been providing the books on a gross liability basisand we have reconciled for the last three years. We found some excessprovisions of around $18 million, which we reversed during the quarter. Thatpositively impacted the margin by around 1.7%.", "Then we had tax reversals, whichrelates to the earlier years where the assessments got over or the statutory limitationperiod got over. That was around $13 million. On the operating margin side,there is a California settlementwhich impacted 2.4% and there was a reversal of insurance of around $18million, which positively impacted 1.7%.", "There was an impact due to rupeeof around 0.8%, because the rupee appreciated by 1.9% during this quarter, andwe had the benefit of increase in per capita revenue, which offsetted theimpact due to rupee.", "We had scale benefit coming onthe SG&A side. Last quarter we had the earn-out payment for the partners inInfosys Consulting of around $11 million to $12 million that was not there thisquarter. So the SG&A cost came down. It positively impacted the margin byaround 1.4%. It flow to the operating margin of around 1.2%.", "We gave a guidance of $0.51. Weended up at $0.54. The $0.02 came because of tax reversal and we have seenupside of $0.01 because of growth in revenues. Our effective tax rate is almostat 15.4%. It was 15.1% last quarter. If we exclude the tax reversal during thequarter, it is at 15.6%.", "Net-net, we have increased ourguidance slightly for the whole year. For the full year, our revenues areexpected to grow somewhere between 35% and 35.2%, and our EPS is expected togrow by 34%. For the full year, we expect the margins to remain, say, at thesame level. At three months, we are assuming the currency to be at the 39.4%,which is a closing date for December.", "And we assume that we'll add31,000 employees on a gross basis for the full year. Last quarter, we said 30,000,we increased the guidance by 1,000 more people and we assume the pricing toremain flat at the same level as it was in December for the next three months.So, assuming all this, we believe that the margins could be stable for the fullyear as compared to last year.", "With this, I conclude mypresentation. We can take the Q&A now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Our first question comes fromJoseph Foresi. Please announce your company name and location and go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Hi, Joseph Foresi from Boston.I know you guys talked about the budget process taking a little longer. Iwonder if you could give us some color on why any specific reasons that you'rehearing from clients for the delay of committing to the budget.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "This is Kris here. Obviously, youknow, there are concerns about the economy. The macroeconomic conditions arethe reasons for the delay. There is another reason also, we are also seeingthat this time around there is lot more involvement from the leadership of thecompany in deciding on the budgets and the plans for the year and things like.Maybe that's another reason why there is some delay.", "Where the budgets have beenclosed, where we have visibility, et cetera? We are seeing that the proportionof allocation - the budget allocation to offshore continues to be robust andthat's the strategy companies are - even in this period when they look atoptimizing their expenditure.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Thanks. And I was wonderingif you could give us some rough idea maybe what percentage of those budgetprocesses are still open and you're willing to close? I mean, how muchvisibility do you think you have heading into next year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "No, I don't have a percentage,because we only look at some of our customers. We don't look at all of ourcustomers, than we look at being part of the budget, especially the largercustomer. So, it's difficult for me to give you a percentage and things likethat at this point.", "We also look at other data pointslike industry analysts et cetera. Most of the analysts are at least - whateverreports I have seen project that IT spending will be about 4% to 6% or maybeeven 7%. Last year was estimated to be 8%. So, which still not too much lowerthan last year and that is also a positive data point.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And just lastly here, inthe budgets that have closed have you seen a push to increase outsourcing as acost saving method or is there any impetus for other portion? Thanks guys.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Yes. As I said, offshore isgetting a higher allocation in the budgets that are closed. The budgets thatwere closed approximately 6% is increasing IT spending and offshore gets ahigher proportion.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from MosheKatri. Please announce the company name and location and go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Thanks. Cowen in New  York. Again, not to beat a dead horse here, since weare talking about delays in budgeting and the budget cycle, can you talk to usa bit more about why are you so comfortable with your expectations for theMarch quarter? I think that will be helpful. And then also, can you provide anupdate on what some of your investment banking clients are actually doing inthis environment?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So, we look at data points whichwe have. We have seen increase in banking and capital markets business. Thatbusiness has grown by 8.6%. Overall BFSI space has grown by 7%. The companygrowth was 6.1%. So, it's growing faster than company average.", "We had new customer additions andnew projects wins in the BCM space. We had rate increases in the BCM space. Wedid not see any cancellations in the BCM space. So these are the data pointswhich gave us comfort in saying that we will be able to meet the Q4 numbers.", "Now, of course, Q4 is only justone more quarter, and overall for the year when you look at fiscal 2008, thisis the last quarter. And in the beginning itself, we had projected certainrevenue for Q4 and it's gone up slightly, but by and large, it's almost flat.And the reason why we were cautious is because of the budget cycle and thingslike that. So, we have factored all the data points we have, when giving theguidance at this point.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Okay. That's fair enough. Andthen, Bala, can you comment on volume growth, the growth there in the quarter,which seemed a bit weak. And then EBIT margin during the quarter wasexceptionally strong. That was pretty impressive. Can you again go through thelist of the pluses and minuses impacting the margin?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Well the volume growth was 4.5%.There was price increase of 0.8%, resulting in 6.1% growth in revenues. Thevolume growth has been exceptionally good. When we gave that that guidance inOctober, we factored in the holidays during the quarter. Normally, the thirdand fourth quarters for us are soft quarters, because the number of holidaysand expected plans, budget period in December to conclude the earlier budget. Imean, in January to March, they had to come up with a new budget. So normally,it's a soft quarter. Considering that background, the volume growth has beenextremely good during the current quarter.", "The operating margin improvementmainly came about because of the scale benefits we got on SG&A. As I saidearlier, last quarter, we had earn-out payment for Infosys Consulting that hasincreased sales and marketing cost. That has come down this quarter, becausethat was a one-off event last quarter.", "So the scale benefit has slowedthe operating margin. Though we got scale benefit of 1.4%, the improvement inoperating margin was 1.2%. We had a currency impact of 0.8%, which was offsetby the productivity increase of 0.8% we saw during the quarter.", "We had an impact of 2.4% becauseof the California settlement,which got offset by the reversal we made on insurance of 1.7% of revenues. Sonet-net, the improvement in operating margin is mainly a result of the benefitwe saw on the SG&A due to the scale.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then finally, can yougive us an update on where we are in the profitability of some of thesubsidiaries that we spoke about in the past, whether it's China,Australia andNorth America Consulting? Are we close, and maybe you can talk about who isclose to breakeven and who is still kind of losing money?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Well, all the subsidiaries aredoing well. Some of it like Consulting and Chinaare still in the investment phase. Consulting, the losses has been -- is moreor less negligible during the quarter. They are still in the investment phase.They could be making a couple of million dollars of losses in the next two,three quarters. After that they could breakeven.", "Chinais still in the investment phase, it will take some more time. Because we havesome 690 employees in China,our revenue there is around $5 million a quarter, it will take some more timefor us to breakeven. But the other subsidiaries are doing well. Australiahas done well. They were up 14% net. IBPO has done well. They are growing fast.", "So Consulting and Chinawill take some more time. They are still in the investment phase.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from TripChowdhry. Please announce the company name and location and go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "Definitely. Trip Chowdhry, GlobalEquity Research. A question for Shibu. You did mention that the customers youspoke to had budget increase of 6%. Could you provide some color on it, likewhat specific areas are you seeing the budget increase, and the budget increaseit's more on the ADM side or new projects, and what is driving that?", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer", "See, what is driving is offshore.And depending on the client, the services are different. We're still seeinguptick on infrastructure management. We are seeing uptick on the traditionalapplication, development and maintenance, especially on the maintenance side.And we are seeing uptick on Package Implementation, maintenance of the package.", "So, it is actually broad. Even weare seeing discretionary spends and development projects. There are somedatacenter consolidations which are going on in a virtualization and thingslike that. So it's a very broad set of offering and services, and it's reallydependent on specific clients. So, it's very broad.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "And looking at your segments, itseems like banking and financial and telecom did well while the services waslittle weak. Can you provide some color among these various segments?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Yeah. Banking and capital market,Telco, manufacturing all the top industry verticals grew faster than thecompany average. And we got some big deals also in these industries. So that ishelping us. If you look at actually, Shibu talked about it, top 25 clients grew9.3% this quarter. So that's helping us in some of these sectors.", "And other sectors, for example,retail, in fact retail probably is one sector where before Thanksgiving maybethere was some concern and slowdown was seen, but now it's disappeared. But, ifyou look at the performance this quarter is muted. But overall and I am glad tosay that the top three sectors for us are strong and are showing growth.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equity Research", "Thank you ", "Operator", "Next question comes from KarlKeirstead. Please announce the company name and location and go ahead please.", "Karl Keirstead - Kaufman Brothers", "Hi, good morning. Karl Keirsteadwith Kaufman Brothers in New York.A question about the revenues you generated from your largest client in theDecember quarter. It went up significantly and was a big contributor to yourrevenue growth. Perhaps you can't name the client, but can you give us a littlebit of color in terms of the industry or the type of project and let us knowwhether there where any one-time revenue boosts from that client that we maynot see in the next few quarters? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "See, I cannot give you too muchdetail, because this will be specific to a particular customer. We are doingmany, many projects for that customer all the way from consulting toinfrastructure management, BPO. Probably that's one customer which is using allthe services that Infosys provides. And we are also doing some very largeprojects for this customer, transformation projects and things like that. Now,when some of those transformation projects come to an end, you may see adecrease in revenue, but it picks up, because this customer is really focusedon increasing offshore. They do work with multiple Indian service providers notjust Infosys, and they have a fairly large program focused on India.This customer has been growing for many quarters, not just in the last quarter.And that's all I can at this point give you in terms of details of this customer.", "Karl Keirstead - Kaufman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks. And secondly, thisrelease you didn't give any color on the wage increase environment in India.Could add a few comments there? Thank you.", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "We believe that the wage increasewill remain at 12% to 15% for next year at this point of time, but we areseeing some very interesting phenomena in India.We are seeing a mega trend of right scaling. That is, companies working out theskill requirements for a particular job and matching skills with a capabilityneeded for the job.", "For instance, over the last threeyears we've hired 3,000 people who are undergrads and not Engineers using themfor testing, using them for infrastructure management services and part ofproduction support and we are going to isolate the timing. They will have aseparate career path. So, the pool of talent will expand and that will have amoderating influence on wage growth as you go along. And because of right scaling,companies I believe in the next two years will hire people depending upon thekind of talent they need and therefore that will help them to moderate wagesand also go deeper into the talent pool.", "People like us want to hire topquality talent and the top 20% always, so we'll pay a higher price and we dobelieve that we get a premium pricing from the client and the right strategyfor us. But overall the supply situation is very much better now compared toearlier. Right scaling will moderate wages as they go along and each company decidesits wage policy based upon the segment in which they will hire. So, we thinkthat this is what is going to drive the wage increases in the next couple ofyears.", "Karl Keirstead - Kaufman Brothers", "Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes fromJulie Santoriello. Please announce your company and location, go ahead.", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you, Morgan Stanley in New  York. Just wanted to make sure I understand thepotential ramifications of customers pushing out their budgets into February.How do you see customer behavior in that regard? If you have a certain portionof customers who are not pushing through their budgets just yet? Do you haveprojects that are on hold right now?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "No, we did not see anycancellations or projects put on hold, that's why we have grown as expected,right. So, we are not seeing anything at this point.", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And the employeeutilization, I think there is a down tick there by about a 150 bps. Can youaddress that, was it just seasonality or was there more going on either plannedor unplanned?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Can you just repeat that please,which line item?", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "The employee utilization.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So, the employee utilization camedown from 79.5% to 77.4%. See, the Q2 is the quarter in which we bring in thelargest number of employees. Now, there is a seasonality to the employeesjoining the company, and typically, Q3 and sometimes maybe Q4, the utilizationcomes down slightly.", "We are very comfortable with theutilization somewhere between 77 and 80, 81, and that's fine. See, in anyquarter, we don't want to optimize all the levers we have in terms of margin.This quarter, for example, the offshore increased, whereas the utilization camedown. And this is the question we have, when it comes to a new quarter and weneed to pull some levers to increase margins and things like that. That givesus the flexibility to manage our business better.", "We have multiple levers, which wecan use to optimize the business in any quarter and things like. All levers arenot optimized in a quarter and this is an example of a lever, which is notoptimized this quarter.", "Julie Santoriello - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ed Caso.Please announce your company name and location. Go ahead.", "Ed Caso - Wachovia", "Hi, Ed Caso, Wachovia, UnitedStates. My question is around the BPO business, can you give us a sense or a sizegrowth? What the clients are asking for? Is there a change in mix and so forth?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Ed, good to hear from you. I amgoing to ask my colleague, Amitabh, CEO of BPO to answer that question.", "Amitabh Chaudhry - Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Managing Director,Infosys BPO", "Hi, everyone. BPO saw a growth of23% quarter-on-quarter, partly held by the Philips acquisition, the acquisitionof Philips captive centers in Lodz,Chennai and Bangkok. Philipsacquisition gave us a revenue of $8.7 billion this quarter. If we exclude that,the BPO business grew by close to 10% quarter-on-quarter. So this quarter, wehave done $68.6 million of revenue. ", "Our standalone business continuesto maintain the margins at 22%. BPO, the Philips, the part of revenues wereobviously at a loss, because in this quarter we have charged off expensesrelated to the acquisitions, some retention money, which was part of theplanned expense. We have also had some accelerated depreciation, and there hasalso been a charge-off on a write-off of customer contact value. But theoverall loss in Philips about $2.5 million is less than what we have [priced]it for. So from that perspective, it is going well.", "Integration of the 1,400 peopleis complete. All the entire senior management has joined us, the attritionlevels have remained low, and the execution on the Philips contract is goingwell. If you look at the mix of the business, mix has remained the same, ourvoice business continues to account for about 20% of overall revenues, thelargest verticals are Telecom, High-Tech and Discrete Manufacturing and BCM andin that order.", "Our pipeline remains quitestrong. We are quite excited about some of the positives we are looking at.After the Philips acquisition, we have more than 5,000 employees in the financeand accounting space, which makes us one of the top five players globally, andwe are already seeing the impact of that in the kind of the deals, we aregetting invited to, the kind of conversations we are having, and obviously itis giving us confidence about the future.", "With this kind of revenue profile,we are pretty much caught up with all the BPO players in Indiawho were four to five years ahead of us. And obviously, our margins remainmuch, much better than them. So overall, attraction is good, pipeline islooking strong, and the Philips acquisition till date has gone very, very well.Thanks.", "Ed Caso - Wachovia", "Thanks. Here's the last question.Any concern from clients and this is sort of an industry-wide question about quality,particularly as you move towards right scaling, and maybe there is a littleless sort of overstaffing from a quality perspective. I mean are you gettingany concerns from all your clients about quality?", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer", "This question is for BPO or thisquestion is for --?", "Ed Caso - Wachovia", "I'm sorry, just generally.", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer", "Ed, there is no concern from theclients because we've done a very good mapping. For example, in the testingarea the work is very repetitive and the quality is of extremely high order. Ininfrastructure management services, the work is repetitive and quality is veryhigh. We met all SLAs.", "In part of the productionsupport, we find that the same situation is coming. We are not seeing anychallenges, but remember the numbers are small. Out of 31,000 people that we'regoing to hire this year, about 9,000 are for the BPO and 22,000 is for theservices. Out of 22,000, we probably will hire about 2,000 people from thisprofile. So the numbers are small and the numbers are very specific. So thereare no quality issues.", "Ed Caso - Wachovia", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from JulioQuinteros. Please announce the company name and location and go ahead.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Goldman Sachs, Services of California.Real quickly, Bala, can you just walk us through kind of a slowdown scenario, Iguess? If you were to sort of look back at the dotcom day sort of meltdown andlook at the potential for a recession in the United  States going forward, what levers would youhave left if revenue growth materially decelerated from here? And maybe, inorder of priority, what would be the top two or three things that you would beable to do to preserve margins in a slowing scenario?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, if you look at whathappened in 2001, 2001 when there was a sharp slowdown, it impacted both ourbilling rates and our volume growth. That time the billing rates were at anunrealistic level because we had a dotcom boom between 2001 and 2002. Theprices went up by something around 25%. Those unrealistic prices got correctedand the economy went to a downturn.", "I think we are today at a muchreasonable pricing level. Only in the last six quarters, we were seeing thatbillings rates going up. So the pricing levels are at a much more reasonablelevel today. So the sharp deceleration we saw after 2001 is slightlyunrealistic now.", "Number two, the volume growthcould come down. But in 2001 offshore was not a mega trend. Most of thecustomers were not looking at offshore as a top priority. But today, offshoreis a mega trend. That is the only trend in the whole industry. If you talk toany CFO, they are very clear about the benefit that offshore brings in.", "So I think to that extent theability of customers to improve the offshore spending within the overall ITspending is very high, and it could happen very quickly than what happened in2001. That's why we keep saying that even if there is a downturn in the U.S.,the offshore IT spending could go up within the overall IT spending.", "On the cost side, we have built amuch more flexible cost structure today. We are getting the scale benefits. Weare leveraging offshore for all our support work. We are sitting tight on thecosts. We have several levers on the cost side like the utilization rate, theon-site offshore mix, and we are moving up the value chain.", "Today, more than 50% of ourrevenue comes from new services, which we started in the recent past. And wealso have the utilization rate, and our wages also, we made it more variable.[13%] of offshore wages is variable, linked to company's performance in termsof top line and bottom line.", "So, over the years we had madeour cost structure much more variable, and that will help us to reduce theimpact on margin, even if there is a downturn. Of course, there are issues likecurrency, which is excellent to us, which we can't do much. As long as -- mostgradually we can manage some of it, but if there is a sharp movement it willhit us. Excluding currency, we had created a flexible cost structure, whichwill allow us to reduce the impact on margins even if there is a downturn.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, that's very helpful. Andjust on the one point, I know that there was a one-time hit to the SG&Alast quarter with payout for the ICI for the consulting part, but even if youlook at the number sort of in aggregate the level on a percentage of revenuebasis for SG&A is at really, really low levels. Is that just a variabilitycomponent sort of kicking in, because the revenue growth or the magnitude ofthe upside for revenue growth just didn't materialize this quarter? Is that theway to think about why that dropped by so much other than the one-time paymentnot being there?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "No, if you look at our cost, ourG&A is normally around the 8%, and F&M is somewhere between 6% and 7%and that trend is there for sometime. And this quarter, one, because theearn-out was not there, which was there last quarter and number two, we got acredit for the insurance, which I spoke earlier, that is allocation betweendirect cost and the G&A cost, that also played a role. But, on a steadystate basis G&A could be somewhere around the 8%, we could get some scalebenefit there, and F&M could be somewhere between 6% to 7%.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, got it. And then justfinally, when we look at the pace of growth in North America from the beginningof the year to the end of the year, obviously a deceleration from about 38%growth to 30% growth on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk a little bit aboutwhat factors are driving that? Is that just sort of a shift in emphasis from North America to Europe or are you seeingsomething else that is sort weighed the performance of the North American growth?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "So, Europehas grown, if you look at year-to-date. Europe has grown43%, whereas North America has grown 33.8%. So,obviously, we are shifting the growth away from North Americato other geographies. Rest of the world grew 37.5%, Europe43%. This is a proactive strategy. For sometime we have been trying to grownon-U.S revenues. So, we are investing in newer geographies as part of this[reorg] also India, China, we will be setting up sales and marketing for Southand Latin America, Middle East. We want to grow Australia.So, definitely, you will see as a percentage, in absolute terms all thesegeographies are growing, as a percentage North Americais coming down.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from AndrewSteinerman. Please announce the company and location and go ahead.", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Hi it's Andrew Steinerman, BearStearns. In the press release you used the line in the midst of your comments.You have concluded several multi-million dollar deals, meaning programs, workfor clients during the quarter. Was this expected kind of program ends, wouldsay that it was a natural number of program ends of kind of multi-milliondollar projects and do you expect and how do you expect sort of the balance forthe fourth quarter between multi-million dollar projects starts versusmulti-million dollar project ends?", "S. Gopalakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "I don't have the data on numberof projects, large programs which ended in Q3, so, I can't immediately answerthat. But if you look at our pipeline today for large deals, we have about 15,16 deals we're still pursuing and that's the number we look at, these areprograms which are in our case $50 million to $100 million and above.", "So that's the kind of programs weare going after. And that pipeline has been growing slowly and we track that.The nine deals which we talk about are in the range of about $30 million plusmulti-year, multi-services deals, and these are the ones which are fromexisting clients as well as new clients and are not just new clients. Itsexisting and new clients and these are some of the things, which we have beenpursuing for maybe some times three months, six months etcetera. And this trendwe just highlighted so that people can see that we have had wins in Q3 also inspite of the concern of slow down and things like that.", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Right, and I think that sort ofaddresses half the question well. The fact that you highlighted, concludedseveral multi-million dollar programs in the quarter, did you know three monthsago that those would conclude in December quarter, and is there an unusualnumber of program ends in the March quarter to be expected?", "S. Gopalakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "No, we do not know exactly when aprogram will close, because that depends on the customer. It's very difficultfor us to say precisely on which month it will close and things like. We havesome indication, the client would give an indication saying that we want toclose on particular month and start, but sometimes they slip and things likethat.", "From the March quarter, thereisn't any unusual change or anything like that from previous quarter in termsof number of project closures and things like that. See 96% of our business isrepeat business, and even though our contracts are long term projects, the workorders are for the project duration. These are ongoing things, we occasionallysee a client coming down and then pick up later, there are some seasonality andthings like that, but by and large, its 96% repeat business.", "We have a comfortable trackrecord in terms of growing accounts and handling long term relationships andthings like that. There is nothing special about project closures in Q4, we cansee at this point.", "Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns", "Thank you for spending so muchtime with my question.", "Operator", "Next question comes from DavidGrossman, please announce company name and location go ahead. ", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi, Thomas Weisel Partners in San  Francisco. Kris on one hand, I hear you saying you arepretty comfortable with the current kind of environment and you are prettycomfortable with your kind of business, kind of prospects. When I look at thevolume growth over the fiscal year, it's being decelerating each quarter on ayear-over-year basis. So can you help reconcile your point of view with what lookslike, at least, decelerating volume growths on a year-over-year basisthroughout the year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "David, good to hear from you.Normally Q3 and Q4 are slower quarters for us. Q3 is slower because of reducednumber of working days. Q4, typically, we are cautious because if the budgetgets delayed, et cetera, we may see some slow growth and things like that. Sonormally, we are cautious about Q3 and Q4.", "And it is not unexpected. We hadexpected this, and we had guided for 30% growth at the beginning of the year.We are ending with 35% growth. Our guidance is 35% to 35.2% for the year. So,in that sense, this is something which we had projected and things like that,nothing different from what we have projected.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Right. So I guess I'm looking atthe volume growth on a year-over-year and not on a sequential basis. And arethere fewer workdays in the second, third and fourth quarter this year thanthere were last year? I guess, again, I'm just looking at the volume growthyear-over-year and it just appears that it's been decelerating throughout theyear?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "I am just looking at Q3 in '06,Q3 in '07 and Q3 in '08, 6.7% sequential growth in '06, 10.1% last year and6.1% this year. So, it's kind of mirroring '06 actually this time.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. We can perhaps pursue thatoffline. I guess moving on to just the subsidiaries in terms of the profitably,it looks like consulting went positive or breakeven, and I assume that had todo with this one-time payment last quarter. Was there anything else, some ofthe other subs kind of bounced around a little bit? Is there anything otherthan typical kind of lots of small numbers or just seasonality that impactedthe profitability of the subs during the quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan - Chief Financial Officer", "David, Bala here. I think othersubsidiaries are doing well. IBPO, the margin has been flat. Margin has comedown this quarter mainly because we had a Phillips acquisition that would takethe costs. Infosys Australiais still doing well. Their net margin is close to 14%, 15%.", "Consulting and Chinahas done well this quarter. Consulting, the impact on the overall profit isvery less. They never made a profit nor a loss. Chinamade a small loss of $400,000. So, overall Consulting and Chinahas pulled up and they had done well. Both were in the investment phase.Consulting could be making losses for a couple of quarters before they becomebreakeven. Chinawill take some more time. They are still in the investment phase.", "Mexicosubsidiary is making a loss. They made a loss of $1 million this quarter. Sothis is the second quarter of the operation. They will take some more time tobreakeven. Otherwise, rest of the subsidiaries are doing well.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then, just looking atthe verticals, it looks like the insurance vertical weakened a bit during thequarter again. Is that just time and place, client specific or is theresomething else specific to the insurance industry?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "", "Yes, it's just one-off, David. Infact, one of the big deals we won is in the insurance sector, and that shouldpick up the growth going forward.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And just one last thing, ifyou think about where you are today versus prior years, is your visibility intonext year at this point in time from your perspective any different now than ithas been in prior years?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "", "Yeah. There is no change exceptfor - typically, we would have got the visibility of the budget early Jan. Now,we see that it will come completely by end of Jan, first week of February.Other than that there is no change. And having said that, from the discussionswe are having with our clients et cetera there is no change. And in fact, theyare saying offshore should continue to see disproportionate growth and thingslike that. So, in that sense there is no change.", "David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see. Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from MarkMarostica. Please announce company name and location and go ahead.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "Hi, it's actually Mark [Skitovich],Piper Jaffray, Minneapolis, Minnesota.I was just curious, maybe one last budget question. Curious what concentrationof your client base has indicated flat to down '08 budgets and how will thatcompare to those indicating the up 6% that you mentioned?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "It's a broad comment rather thanany particular sector. We only look at some of the larger customers closely andtrack their budgets and things like that. And we have about $305 millionrelationships. All those budgets we don't track. When it comes to $10 millionand above or closer to $50 million, we start tracking their budgets and gettingvisibility of their budgets and things like that. And so, this commentary isbased on that, and that is across multiple industry verticals, not restrictedto any particular industry vertical.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And just curious, can yougive me a rough mix of your headcount within the testing and infrastructuremanagement and then what was your lateral hire mix overall in the quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "The lateral hires this quarterwere about --.", "S. D. Shibulal - Chief Operating Officer", "2,200.", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "It was 2,200. Now, the number ofpeople in testing, I don't have the data of number of people in testing. We cansend you figures. You please send us an email. We can send you the data ofpeople in testing and things like that. BPO is about 16,000 people. That isseparate, because it's a separate business line for us and things like that.But testing, I don't have the number with me at this point.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great and just one finalquestion. I think your Chinaheadcount is still around 700. Is that correct?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Yes, it is correct.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And where do you see that ayear from now? And if also, you could comment on your current headcount inCentral and South America, sort of what that's growingyear-over-year and then what your expectations are there for next year as well?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Chinais growing. We plan to recruit. We are looking at about 200 more people to beadded now, and then as the business picks up, we will keep adding. But rightnow the plans are to add another 200 people to China.In Mexico itjust started, it's in fact the fourth month of operation and we have about 50people in Mexico.Again, we will wait for the business to pick up rather than recruit significantlyahead of business.", "Since the numbers are small, weare confident that we can recruit from the market, so we are not making largeplans from campuses and things like that. It's not along the same lines as in India.For example in India,18,000 offers have been made at the campuses already and these people will bejoining from July through October next year. But, we don't have to make thatkind of plan, those kinds of advanced plans for Mexicoor China yet atthis point.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And in South America,just reminding me of your headcount there and where you see that next year? ", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "It's about 50 people, and as Isaid as business picks up we will start hiring there. Right now it's about 50people.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "There as well. Okay. Great, thankyou.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from AbhiGami. Please go ahead with your questions, announcing your company name andlocation.", "Abhi Gami - Banc of America", "Great. Thank you. Banc of America,New York. In this environmentit's reasonable to think that clients are going to come back looking forpricing concessions. Are you seeing an increased level of interest indiscounting or more accretive pricing, and in these situations, how are youhandling those requests?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "There are not many cases of anydiscount across the board or anything like that. Based on volumes there aresome discounts which are there in the contract or sometimes when the contractcomes for renewal. Because they are promising higher volume etcetera, someclients have asked for further discounts. So the discount is separate fromrates, rates typically we are able to get about 2% to 3% higher on contractsrenewals. Sometimes additional clauses for discounts get added on account ofhigher volumes and things like that.", "Abhi Gami - Banc of America", "So just to be clear, you are notseeing clients comeback looking for just straight rate cut or straight ratediscounting?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Not across the broad and thingslike that. There may be one or two instances, but it's not across all thecustomers, and its impact is limited.", "Abhi Gami - Banc of America", "Okay. Also going back little bitto the commentary regarding the budgets. What was the average IT budgetincrease this time last year based on your survey of your clients, and also howmany clients have you already heard back from?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Last year it was about 8%, thisyear right now we are seeing 6% increase in IT budget from our survey andthings like that. And we also do a survey to look at their attitude towardsoffshore or where the offshore should go, and we have seen increased proportionof revenues coming to offshore. Now I don't have a breakup of the percentage ofcustomers with whom we have budget visibility and things like that, because weonly look at the top few customers when it comes to budgets. You know $50million and above, sometimes it maybe $30 million and above and things likethat.", "Below that, the numbers are sohigh that we don't go after them to give us a share of the budget. And fromthat number, I don't have the percentage -- who have given us budgets andthings, in fact almost all customers share at some point budgets and thingslike that, but I don't have the breakup right now.", "Abhi Gami - Banc of America", "Okay. I just wanted to get asense of whether the data you have received back so far from those largeclients is good enough for you to be able to get visibility into your next 12months, or do you still require the remaining large customers to come back andgive you the information before you can get comfortable internally with theforward trend?", "S. Gopalakrishnan - Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Fortunately for me, the fullfiscal year guidance we will only be giving it in April. So we can get thisdata and then be better prepared in April to give you full year guidance. So,we can wait for that data at this point.", "Let me thank you all. We have runout of time. I know that many of your questions have not been answered or someof you did not get a chance to ask a question. If you can contact our InvestorRelationship Manager, Sandeep Mahindroo or Shekar Narayanan, or send us anemail, we will definitely respond to you or, if needed, we can set up a call todiscuss these with you.", "We thank you for taking time toparticipate in this call and looking forward to talking to you or meeting youduring the quarter or at the beginning of next fiscal. Thank you, again."]}

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo. Please go ahead, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "", "Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys financial results for the quarter ending December 31, 2008.", "I am Sandeep, I am in the investor relations team in New York. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Mr. Gopalakrishnan, COO, Mr. Shibulal, and CFO Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of senior management.", "We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter followed by the outlook for the quarter end and year ended March 31, 2009. Subsequently we will open up the discussion for Q&A. Before I pass it on to the management, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the rest of the company's papers. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'll now pass it on to Mr. Gopalakrishnan.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Thanks, Sandeep, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone wherever you are. Thank you very much for participating in this call.", "Despite a challenging environment, including drastic movement in cross currencies, we have delivered a reasonable performance. It is an all-round performance. Revenues in constant currency grew 1% sequentially in dollar terms. The reported revenues of course dropped sequentially by 3.7%, but in constant currency terms, the revenue grew 1%. Volume growth was 2%. We had a blended pricing decline of 1.8% in constant currency terms, but operating margin increased by 2.3% sequentially during the quarter.", "We added almost 6,000 gross employees. We met our guidance, and revenue was in the range in which we had talked about. Our repeat business continues to be high at 97%. We added 30 new clients during this quarter. We closed four large deals of $15 million plus. Our attrition has come down to 11.8%. Utilization has gone up from 74.1% to 74.8%, so all around good performance. We are looking to add another 3,700 gross employees. Most of these are at entry level honoring the commitments we have made in the campuses.", "And given the challenging environment, we feel we\u2019ve delivered a good performance. We have kept our guidance the same except for two things were taking into consideration. One is the currency movement; second is the vendor pricing decline. Other than that, we have kept the guidance for Q4 the same. The environment continues to be challenging. We feel that our model has again proved to be resilient. We have proved that we are been able to sustain margins in these difficult times. And as things improve, when the cycle ends and recovery starts, we should be in a strong position to take advantage of this. We have $1.98 billion of cash on hand and overall a good performance.", "Now I'll pass it on to my colleague, Shibulal, to give you more details on the business performance.", "S. D. Shibulal", "", "This is Shibu. As Krish said, this has been a very good quarter for us. In spite of multiple issues, we have delivered on the guidance. Billing rates have come under pressure, our prices have come down by 1.8% on constant currency. We believe it is manageable at this point. There are multiple price negotiations. Our strategy is to convert the price negotiations into more of value conversations. We can convert deals to fixed price, to transaction based pricing, link volume to price, et cetera.", "We also believe that if the situation gets worse, the pricing could come under pressure again. We have not seen any material cancellation of projects as of right now. They seem to have run their course. At the same time, the velocity of the business has come down. Decision-making is slow, scrutinies are higher and that is impacting our \u2013 and that has impacted our growth.", "Budgets are not finalized. We are looking to February, March to finalizing budgets. We have won four large deals, $50 million to $100 million this quarter and there are multiple deals in the pipeline. Utilization has gone up 74.8% compared with 72.1%. We are comfortable with 76% to 80%. Three subsidiaries, Infosys China, Infosys Consulting and Infosys Mexico are still in the investments stage. But we need to look at these more from our MSI reporting rather than from the statutory reporting.", "We have added 30 new clients this quarter. Our top ten clients grew 2.3% in constant currency, and non-top ten group 0.1% sequentially in constant currency. The contribution from the largest, the top client came down in percentage terms. But in actual numbers, in constant currency, it has only moved down by a couple of million dollars, not anything material. We will add 27,000 people this year. We applied for 9,000 visas, and out of that, the government has taken up 4,800. Our visa utilization is 49%, which is very healthy.", "With that, let me now hand over to Bala to discuss the financials.", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Good morning, everybody. This quarter was good. Our revenues were $1.171 billion. It is a decline of 3.7% on a reported number basis, but if we look at the constant currency, it grew by 1% and it grew by around 14.6% on a year on year basis. I think if you look at the guidance we gave in the beginning of the quarter, we said that revenues will be somewhere between $1.175 billion to $1.220 billion. If you restate it for the currency, the range could be $1.137 billion to $1.181 billion. The actuals is $1.171 billion. So we met the guidance.", "Even if you look at the EPS, we gave a guidance of $0.57. The actual is around $0.58. If you remove that $0.02 because of the tax reversal pertaining to earlier years, it is $0.56. It is mainly because of the cross currency impact even though we had a benefit of $0.07 in the EPS. Because of the rupee depreciation against the dollar, we had an impact of $0.08 because of the cross currency movements.", "If you look at the operating margin for the quarter, it is around 43.6%, almost the same as last quarter. Operating margins have gone up. It is 31.8 as compared to 29.5 basically because the rupee impact, we got a benefit of 4.7% in the margins because of rupee, because it depreciated by close to 11%. And we had a negative impact because of cross currency on the operating margin of 1% and the utilization coming down from 70.7% last quarter to 68.5% this quarter impacted the margin by around 1.3%. There were offsetting factors like reduction in SG&A and the reduction in overall per capita revenue. So net net, at the net margin level, out net margins are at 28.3%. Last quarter was 26.2%. If you remove the tax reversal, it is 27.3% compared to 26.2% last quarter.", "As you all know, at the beginning of the year, we gave a guidance of 19% to 21% for growth in revenues. We reduced it to 13% to 15% in the beginning of the quarter, mainly to factor in a currency impact and also the general economic environment. Now we are revising it to 12% to 13%. If you look at the difference between 19% to 21% in the beginning, and the 12% to 13% what we give today, the differences are mainly because of the currency. Currency is around 4% to 5%. So on a constant currency basis, the way to look at 12% to 13% is to look at constant currencies. It'll be around 16% to 18%.", "Our guidance for next quarter factors in the reduced per capita revenue, because we have seen the per capita revenue reducing by 1.8% on constant currency terms. In the third quarter, we are taking the same per capita revenue for the fourth quarter, and we are maintaining the guidance just adjusting it for currency. If you look at the non-operating income, not-operating income, we have a loss because of translation and hedging. Last quarter, we had a loss of $28 million because of the currency. This quarter we have a loss of $44 million. We had a benefit in operating income because the rupee depreciated. Operating income went up by $41 million because of the rupee depreciation, but we had a impact on non-operating of around $44 million. I think net net at the net income level, the impact is minimized.", "Subsidiaries have done well. If you look at IBPO, it added $67 million of revenue. The net margin is 16%. Australia did $26 million in revenue. The revenue has come down there mainly because of currency. At net income, they have 6.2% as net margin. Consulting made a loss of $2.6 million, China $2 million, Mexico $0.5 million. All these subsidiaries are still in the investments stage and that is the reason why they are making losses.", "This quarter, the currency market has been quite volatile; the economic environment has been challenging. Even in this environment, with all the volatility, we are able to maintain the growth, we are able to maintain the margins, we're able to have better DSOs, DSO days of 56 days for the quarter in a quarter where there are a lot of holidays, where the environment is challenging, we were able to collect most of our receivables and make sure that DSO days are reduced.", "We are ending the quarter with $1.98 billion of cash. We believe that\u2019s very important in an environment like this. It gives a lot of comfort to not only us, but also to the customers and other stakeholders who wants to deal with us.", "With this I conclude. Now we can open up the floor for Q&A. Thank you.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "", "Jennifer, we can start the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions) We will go ahead and take our first question from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair", "", "Hey, guys. Good quarter. A couple of quick questions regarding the pricing issues. The first, could you elaborate a little more on kind of the discussions you have with customers around pricing and then where are you experiencing these conversations? Are there any specific vertical or any specific geo or is it across-the-board?", "S. D. Shibulal", "", "So we are having pricing discussions with a few customers across verticals and across geos. You know if you look at the past ten quarters or so, you can clearly see that our prices have gone up, our revenue productivity has gone up quarter on quarter. We have been able to convince our customers of the value, which we provide and they have been willing to pay us higher value, higher rates throughout that period. Today the customers are undergoing trouble and they are under pressure, so that is where some of the discussions are happening.", "Also we are seeing at least in some occasions competitors cutting price globally and offshore. So our direction is usually to try and convert that discussion into a valid discussion on the value which we deliver and on the total cost of ownership. So we can look at linking those discussions through additional volume, we can look at converting the deal into fixed price, we can look at converting the deal into other pricing models, we can look at productivity improvements. So we explore all these possibilities, and usually we end up in a combination of some of these possibilities.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair", "", "Thanks, Shibu. Just\u2026", "S. D. Shibulal", "", "And \u2013 yes, go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair", "", "And then I guess could you give me some idea of sort of you said a handful of customers, a few customers, the magnitude of that? And is there a risk that other customers kind of see you doing this and then bring their rate card and say we want lower rates? Could you quantify sort of the magnitude of that and also the risk for the rest of the base to do that?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "See that is why we don't work at the rate card level. We try to work with the clients to fixed price the project so that we can get something out of it by improving productivity et cetera. We can meet the customer expectations on their budgets et cetera. We can also leverage our bench offshore so we can offer some free resources again to meet their requirements and things like that temporarily. So we're doing many things such that we meet their requirements and we keep our pricing intact as much as possible. Of course, overall there will be some small impact and that\u2019s what we are seeing. But by and large, we are trying to keep it as minimum as possible. In some cases, we are tying up the increases with volume increases so that it\u2019d be seen as volume discounts.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay. If I could squeeze one last question in here, Bala, if you look at the lowered guidance for the full year, what is the impact of that lower pricing rate on that say 2% decline in guidance? Is there a portion of that that is due to the pricing versus the currency?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Well, if you look at the numbers, at the beginning of the year, we said 19% to 21%. In the beginning of this quarter we said 13% to 15%. Now we are saying 12% to 13%. The reduction is mainly because of currency, the impact of pricing is hardly some 0.5%, but the balance is mainly currency. So from 19%, if you look at 12%, there is the decline of 7%, 7% to 8%. Of that 4% to 5% is currency, balance was due to economic environment. The pricing adjustment of fourth quarter is only 0.5%.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Okay. We will move forward to our next question which will come from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Hey, thanks. Can you give us the revenue growth of the various verticals by constant currency? Hello?", "S. D. Shibulal", "", "Yes. I will give it to you now. The revenue growth in constant currency, BFSI, 4.1% in constant currency; manufacturing declined 3.7% in constant currency; retail grew by 2.9% in constant currency; telecom declined 3.4% in constant currency. The remaining segments, others grew 4.3% in constant currency.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Okay. And then Bala, can you just talk about the different moving parts that drove margins? You had a pretty strong growth in operating margin performance during the quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Well, the operating margin has increased by around 2%. It was 31.9% this quarter, last quarter was 29.9, mainly because of the rupee dollar, because the rupee depreciated by around 11% against the dollar. That gave a favorable impact of 4.7% on the margin. But it was offset by the cross currency move of around 1% and also a decline in utilization of 1.3%. There were some offsetting factors like reduction in SG&A which was more than compensated by the decrease in per capita revenue. So net net, operating margin went up by around 2%.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Okay. And then Krish, you spoke very briefly about clients\u2019 budgets. What are your preliminary thoughts based on what clients are telling you looking at 2009, looking at overall budgets, looking at the allocation for offshore?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "We believe that budgets would get finalized mid February. That is the indication we are getting. We also believe that budgets would be flat or maybe down, down maybe by maybe up to 4%, maybe 5%. In our discussions with clients, they have given us indications that offshore allocation would increase. We don't have a percentage at this point. They are just saying that please don't reduce your recruitment plans et cetera because we believe that offshore would increase and you need to be prepared for that. So that's the stage at which we are at this point. We will get a better picture of this probably mid February. They're also telling us that on the caution side, if things continue to be bad or worsen, even if the budget are there, they may hesitate to spend or they may not be allowed to spend. So that caution is also definitely there.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Okay. And then finally, BFSI held up really well during the quarter. Can you talk about what you're saying there in general and then maybe talk about some of the recent wins. I think you have added about 30 customers, maybe you could talk about which part came from BFSI? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "So, let me ask Ashok. He is here with me to talk about BFSI.", "Ashok Vemuri", "", "Thanks, Krish.", "So the BFSI segment actually from a client addition perspective, of the 30, nine clients are from BFSI, and this is across both the US as well as Europe. We are also beginning to see increased interest from our clients and prospects in other parts of the world, whether it is in Asia as well as in Latin America et cetera.", "We have seen both volumes growth and of course pricing, that\u2019s continued to be a challenge. But at this point of time we are getting a premium for value-added services and we are seeing pricing either being maintained where it was and this is negotiation time for us, contracts and negotiation time for us, so we have seen pricing essentially being tied at a very flat level.", "We are also seeing that the kind of services that we have built out and the capabilities that we have built out and investments that we have made are finding traction and increasing traction in the marketplace, especially in the areas of corporate governance, regulatory corporate governance, risk management, compliance, et cetera.", "Also from our product perspective, that continues to gain traction both in Asia as well as increasingly in Western Europe and with clients in the US. From a budget perspective, we do expect an extension [ph], capital budgets will come in around the mid February time. And the good news is there is even though we may not be seeing increased allocations or increased dollars, the percentage to offshore companies is actually increasing, and we are very confident from the commentary that we are hearing in the market and unlike last year there will not be too much of variation in budget closure and too much variability, but the fact that the budgets will get definitely closed albeit the numbers may be lesser.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Thanks. Good execution.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Of the client additions, nine are in the BFSI space as Ashok said, six are in manufacturing, four in retail, rest are all over. Out of this, 11 customers are in North America, eight are in Europe, and balance in rest of the world, 11 rest of the world.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Thanks, Krish.", "Operator", "", "Okay. We will move to our next question which will come from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "", "Hello, gentlemen. My first question here is just the decision to take up the hiring guidance. Obviously we know that it is a tough environment out there, and it sounds like you are doing this because a lot of your potential customers have said that you might need excess capacity, not stop hiring. I wondered if you could just give us some insight as to why you wouldn't at this point try to do more with less?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Now let me explain this. At the beginning of the year, we said we will hire 25,000 people as the target for the year. We had two components. The first component was the people who are freshers for whom we had made 18,000 offers last year. The second component was the laterals and the third corporate was the BPO. Now as of this quarter, we have already hired about nearly 24,000 people. Part of the increase compared to the pro rata figures that we had are due to the fact that the higher percentage of people than estimated from the fresher batch joined the company. We made a certain estimate, a higher percentage joined.", "Now we sat down and made a full evaluation to see what is going to be the gross numbers for the entire year and we found it is going to be closer to 27 based upon offers made the previous year and percentage joins, based upon the lateral hires that we are going to be doing currently, a very, very small number for specialized skills, and the joins in the BPO. So we're not having additional hiring targets, we're not hiring more people than required for this year, we are just coming out with the statement as to what the estimated final count of hiring will be at a gross level just for this year.", "For the next year, our hiring is based upon the offers we\u2019ve made sometime the previous year in the calendar year 2008. Because the fresher batch is hired, nearly one to 1.25 years ahead of our need, because we always hire in advance. So we have made 20,000 offers already before the first quarter closed, the first quarter itself. So we had already made those offers because the college hiring starts from January, February of the calendar year and possibly ends by about June, July.", "Out of 20,000, we estimate maybe 75% of the people may join, but 15,000 people may join next year. The date of joining is going to be decided and intimated to them in a closed band or otherwise and we are going to tell them. Most of them will join at a particular point and they will not be available for billing in the next financial year because the period of training is 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, they have to take a test and past with a four out of five CGPA. If they don't get that, they go outside the company.", "And right now to avoid people going into the bench and not having work, we have given them additional training of eight more weeks. So for the next year, if things do not improve or things do not change in a big manner, we could have an extended training session. So most of the people who join will join at different quarters, and they may still be training, they may not add to the billable resources next year. But this is what we want to explain about the hiring.", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "You will also realize that this quarter including trainers, utilization is 69%. We were able to sustain or improve the margins. So our model includes the cost of training there, the cost is not that very high. So we believe that we are looking at this from a long-term perspective. By honoring our commitments, we are creating goodwill in the campuses. By creating this trained pool of resources, we are preparing ourselves for the future, and will be able to respond faster if we see opportunities in the market. So we see this as a strength of the model and a competitive advantage in some sense.", "", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "", "Okay. Just I mean traditionally you have linked or at least I believe the analyst community has believed that you have linked headcount to revenue growth. So as hiring numbers have gone up here, can we expect that same link, or is there not a link between the two?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "See traditionally we would have planned for a utilization of 78% to 80%. The utilization is lower because growth has slowed down, so you will have to use that factor. The utilization will continue to be lower than our optimum level for the next few quarters unless of course growth picks up and we are able to use these people. Attrition also is coming down, so that will also reduce the utilization. We're looking at how we can leverage this, how we can maybe take advantage of this, but right now it looks like utilization will be lower. But that cost are not too high and we hope to sustain the margins in spite of all this.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "", "Just one last question on the labor front, as far as, let\u2019s assume the outlook for next year is potentially worse than maybe some of the data points that you're getting right now, and there is not as much work for your projected hiring schedule, what is management\u2019s view as far as how to handle that? Would you be pushing out offers or assuming things get very bad, would you look at potential layoffs?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No let me explain that again. Out of the 15,000 people who may join, next year will have an opening balance of maybe 105,000 people, 104,000 people. Assuming an attrition rate of 10%, because a 10% attrition would be a normal attrition even in the worst period. In the worst period, in the most difficult period that we had in 2001, we had an attrition of something like 6.7% to 6.9%. So if you have a 10% attrition rate, you will normally have about 10,000 people leaving over a period of time for higher studies or whatever. Let us not forget that 20% of people who leave, leave for higher studies. And about 10% of people who leave, leave because they drop out of the workforce on account of marriage or what family reasons or something else.", "So a 10% attrition rate means we will have 10,000 people, that means that we have a net increase of 5000 people, and those 5000 people will not be billable at the end of the next financial year as per our current training schedule. So they will not be sitting idle there, they will be in training. So I think we have found a nice balance in the target that we have set for the next year.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "", "Okay. And just one last quick question, just maybe on the Satyam front, if management could give any of its sort of views on customers relationships? I know you have some overlapping customers and its view on taking business or additional business from its potential fallout and also employees, if you guys could just present your views? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "So we are seeing some requests from our clients. We are treating these as new requests and we would put together a proposal, give it to the customer, the customer accepts the proposal, then we will take this forward as we would do any other business that comes away. We are not proactively canvassing for Satyam business for obvious reasons. It is not the right thing to do. And if a request comes, we will take it up.", "Over and above this, of course, there is some increased due diligence from our customers. Infosys is very well prepared. Whatever questions that clients have, we are able to answer. In fact whatever the questions investors have, also we are able to answer. We have increased our level of disclosure, we want to make sure that we give comfort to customers, prospects, investors, et cetera about the corporate governance practices. At Infosys, we have increased the disclosures as I said.", "I don't think this will increase the time taken to close deals et cetera. Already the velocity of business had been impacted because of the economic slowdown. We don't see this having an impact especially in the medium to long term.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "We will go ahead and move forward to our next question from George Price with Stifel Nicolaus.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of topics. First wanted to understand why telecom, even on a constant currency basis was down 3.4%, if it is beyond \u2013 in fact even beyond British Telecom, didn\u2019t sound like BT really moved a whole lot. And if you could, related to that comment on \u2013 there are kind of press indications about over thousand employees working at BT possibly being benched in March and the fact that you are still hiring even if that occurs? Thank you.", "Subhash Dhar", "", "Hi, this is Subhash Dhar representing the communications business. On a constant currency basis, you have the telecom vertical declines. I think there is a couple of reasons for that. One is of course that the telecom industry has very few clients which have large accounts for us, and therefore any deficient freezing that happens takes with it a bunch of revenues. There is some lumpiness in that industry, both in terms of business coming and getting frozen at times, that\u2019s one. Second, we did have some vacation enforced in December, in actually some of our biggest clients, which was first it was something we have encountered in the past but has never been enforced in the past years but it was enforced in the year just went by \u2013 just went by. So that gave us a couple of weeks in fact on some of our biggest clients.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay, and if you could just comment on the press articles talking about the potentially benching, I think it was like 1200 employees at BT possibly by March and maybe how that factors into how you are thinking about, you know, quarter-over-quarter growth into the June quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Well, we don\u2019t know where that article came from. As it is we don\u2019t have a policy on commenting on specific customers but we clearly don\u2019t understand where that article came from.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay. So that is something that you don\u2019t \u2013 I guess, just as the June quarter question, do you think you could see another quarter-over-quarter decline in June?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No, we expect it to be flat on a constant currency basis.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay. And that is an overall question for the business not just telecom?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Yes, for the business.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "All right.", "Operator", "", "We will move to a question from Rod Burgess from Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "", "Yes, Rob Rod Bourgeois here. Hey we talked about pricing on the earlier call, but I wanted to clarify what you are assuming precisely in your guidance for the March quarter and if you have got any assumptions on that in terms of how it might play out over the next year? Are you assuming flat pricing in dollar terms or are you assuming a similar decline in pricing as what occurred in the December quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "So, right now we are assuming flat pricing in dollar terms for Q4, same pricing as end of Q3.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "", "Okay, great. And is there something happening in the market that would cause you to believe that the pricing decline will attenuate now. Is there a mix factor or some other dynamic happening where the pricing concession requests are subsiding at this point?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No, by and large we have been able to manage the pricing by giving various options and choices to our clients so that their requirements are met, their budgets are met and our requirement to hold on to the pricing is met, fixed pricing by moving work offshore, by looking at, we have a bench anyway, so by giving for the short period maybe some additional resources to clients et cetera. So, we are able to meet their expectations and manage our requirements also. So, that is what we are doing. In some cases we are linking pricing decreases with volume growth. So volume discount is again something we do always, and so it\u2019s part of that. So, we are trying to manage this as best as we can. Now if the situation just continues like this, we believe that we will be able to handle it better, but if the environment worsens, then it could become challenging. So we have to wait and see; we don\u2019t know what is going to happen there.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "", "So what you are seeing right now with your value approach is the deal structuring, you think pricing can definitely be flat in the March quarter but it\u2019s definitely a factor that you are monitoring closely, is it the way to look at it?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Yes, we feel that we can handle the margin. We are saying the margin will be flat, we\u2019ve assumed that pricing will be the same level as Q3, and then we are monitoring the situation very, very carefully. We \u2013 every pricing discussion gets escalated up to the Chief Operating Officer and the CFO. So we are fully aware of its impact. We have a portfolio approach, so based on our ability to absorb that we take the decision. So we have a portfolio approach, we look at it company wide, we look at the impact, so it is centralized at this point, and we tightly control this.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "", "Okay. And I think you\u2019ve indicated on this topic, but I just wanted to follow up. I mean we\u2019ve seen in the last several months kind of an elongation of decision making cycles because of all the macro issues that are out there. And in the two to three months we have had the Satyam fiasco as well as the Mumbai terrorist attacks, are you expecting any further elongation in decision making cycles or do you feel like the worst is behind us on that front?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No. Whatever has happened in Mumbai and with Satyam, we are not seeing at this point any increase in decision making time et cetera. Already velocity of business had slowed down past September. That is when the collapse of the various banks happened et cetera. That is when the pendulum swung to the other side in terms of, you know, what everybody expected the economy to do. Till then there was hope that it may not happen, but after that you know everybody decided the worst is going to happen. So the pendulum swung to the other extreme. So, velocity came down after September. We have not seen anything different now. It continues to be challenging and slow.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "", "Thank you guys very much.", "Operator", "", "We will go ahead and move forward to a question from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities", "", "Thank you and very good execution. I was just wondering regarding the H1 visas will start to be opened again in the month of April, how do you see your needs would be regarding H1 visas and do you see it will be same as last year, up, down? And how about the pricing on visas, and has your guidance incorporated the fee structure and the expenses related to visa? Thank you?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "You know it considers that there is seasonality to visa and typically in Q1 we will have higher visa expenses et cetera that we normally factor in. Now what the visa policy would be, what the regime is et cetera we don\u2019t know at this point. All data what we have is what you also have and our assumptions are all based on that it continues to be what it is today. There is no new information we have about that.", "", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities", "", "Thanks.", "", "Operator", "", "Okay. Our next question comes from Ed Caso with Wachovia.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia", "", "Good morning. Congratulations on managing in a tough environment. Couple of quick questions here. Was there a breakup fee for the Axon deal and then how much was it in dollars?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Well we got around 4 million pounds, which is after break inducement fee for the Axon deal, there was a expense of around 1.8 million pounds and the net 2.2 million pounds is shown in the non-operating income.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia", "", "And any license fees out of the ordinary this quarter. I thought I heard that the product business is doing well?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "There is nothing extraordinary except in the tax line item. We had a reversal of $13 million pertaining to earlier years. Other than that I don\u2019t think there are any exceptional items.", "", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia", "", "Anything different on your accrual for variable comps or and could you give us some thoughts on where wages stand sort of going forward?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Well, the variable component for this quarter is similar or slightly higher than the last two quarters. There is no change there. Going forward the variable payout depends on the revenue growth and operating margins. So that is a function of those two. At least for third quarter there is no reduction in the variable pay. This is almost similar to first two quarters or slightly higher than that.", "", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia", "", "I was curious about sort of coming up on the annual wage cycle here in April. So any thoughts at this point. I assume wages have been \u2013 increases have been dropping, I mean, is it looking like they are going to be flat year-over-year coming up in FY10?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "We believe that salary increases would be muted if any this year. You know, the environment is considerably softened at this point. So it maybe very much muted this year.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia", "", "A final question. On the BPO business, I think it is down if I saw the numbers right. How much of that is sort of the timing of contract and how much of that is just sort of volume, lower volumes that you might be doing?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "I have Amitabh with me. So he will talk about BPO. Amitabh.", "Amitabh Chaudhry", "", "I am not going to cater to the revenue question, but if it was, then yes the basic decline in revenue is because of currency. 58% of our revenues come in pounds and euros and if you take a look on a constant currency basis we actually grew 4% plus quarter-on-quarter from a BPO perspective. So it is mainly because of the currency that we have got hit in a big way this quarter because of pound and euro depreciation against the dollar.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "All right. We will move to a question from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "Hi guys. A quick question. I mean I realize that the constant currency growth rate relative to the beginning of the year hasn\u2019t moved all that much but when you look at the rate of deceleration from the beginning of the year to what is projected into the fourth quarter it looks like we are finishing the fourth quarter out above the 5% to 9% year-over-year growth in constant currency and if you sort of project that growth rate out into fiscal 2010, what drivers or what are you seeing right now in the business that would actually lead to any acceleration into fiscal year 2010?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "We have seen constant currency terms the growth rate would probably be around 16% \u2013 15% to 18%.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "That is for the full year, but for the fourth quarter it is finishing at 5% to 9% right?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Okay, fourth quarter, okay. Now going forward yes it is going to be a challenging environment. We are looking at all drivers for growth looking at what else we can do. The feeling is that if there is some stability. Recovery it doesn\u2019t have to really happen, but if there is some stability then customers will feel confident in kicking off some projects and that should give us some increase in growth. So that is what we feel now. We are waiting for the budgets to be finalized. We will know by probably mid-February. That will also give us some indication about allocation to offshore. In our discussions with clients they are telling us that, you know please don\u2019t significantly reduce your recruitment and things like that. So, we will have to wait and see.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, got it. And then just a couple of quick questions on looking at the balance sheet, Bala can you just talk to the other comprehensive losses that were seen. I think the other \u2013 accumulated other comprehensive income that is now negative $413 million and detailed in the balance sheet of a build up of a stockholder of the book \u2013 shareholders equity. Can you talk about what is driving that down because it started \u2013 the balance started with a positive 39 and it is now down to a negative $413. What are the other drivers on that?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Can you repeat that? We are not able to completely follow that question? Can you just about the balance sheet\u2026", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "On the balance sheet in the build up for stockholders equity, the accumulation other comprehensive income entry is negative $413 million.", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Yes that is a translation loss or gain because when the rupee depreciates or appreciates in a big way in any quarter that number comes up bigger because the rupee depreciated by 11% this quarter. So that is a translation of the balance sheet items on a particular date.", "", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it. And then on the decline in the DSOs for the quarter, can you just walk back through why your DSOs went down so much. Are you actively going after your accounts to try and collect some cash and by the same token it doesn\u2019t appear like you are taking up any reserves for doubtful accounts. Can you just sort of give us a balance in terms of the faster collections but no real improvement in the doubtful accounts reserves?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "See in an environment like this we are focused on collecting the money as quickly as diligently as possible. So there has been tremendous focus from everyone on collection and our people have done a good job. It is just that \u2013 they have done a good job. That is all.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "And then what about on the doubtful account side? Why wouldn\u2019t you also taking out the doubtful account reserves?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Again can you just repeat that Julio?", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "Why would the doubtful account balance not be going up at the same time? It doesn\u2019t look like it actually went up for the quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Now are you saying that we are writing off more receivables?", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "No, no, no. The doubtful accounts \u2013 I can follow up offline that is no problem.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No, no. Look Julio, we provide for all receivables more than 180 days. Even for receivables less than 180 days for their concerns we do provide for it. We don\u2019t have any large uncollectable receivables at any point of time. This quarter the DSO days basically went down because in an environment like this we said we have to go behind all customers and make sure we collect money on time because this is an environment where people have lot of challenges on the liquidity front. So the DSOs actually came down because we are aggressive in collecting the money. In spite of more holidays in this quarter our sales force went out and collected most of the dues from the clients. That is why the DSO days came down.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "And Bala real quickly on the last quarter, the implied operating margin, it looks like it is down from the third quarter just based on the comments for flat margins for the year. The level that it would come down to just back of the envelope calculation is something like 23% down from 31%. What are you guys factoring into that fourth quarter operating margin for it to decline so much?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "See Julio for the fourth quarter we are assuming the rupee-dollar rate to be at 48.71. If you remember 49.42 is the average rate for the third quarter that is one. Number two, in the third quarter we had the substantial benefit of the rupee depreciation. There was an impact of close to 3.7% on our operating margin because of the currency and we had the equal amount of the impact on the non operating line item because of translation hedging loss. So on the net level if you look at the fourth quarter guidance, the net margins are similar to what we have seen in the third quarter. There was an operating gain in the third quarter. There was a non operating loss. Both were not assumed in the fourth quarter.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Okay. Our next question will come from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. And I know it has been a bit of a delicate one but with regard to Satyam, would you see the development at Satyam as being a net benefit or net positive to Infosys and why?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "You know, we \u2013 if you take an industry view it is \u2013 it is sad, it is disappointing, it is dismaying. If you take a company view, you know, there are positives and negatives again. You know, we have to \u2013 we have to provide additional information to our clients. They are increasing their due diligence and things like that. If you are able to convince probably still give you more business and more opportunity. So there are some positives also.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Okay Mohan, with regard to your expectations on wages, is there any chance to potentially reduce wages in 2010, fiscal 2010?", "T.V. Mohandas Pai", "", "I don\u2019t think there is potential to reduce wages which people get because it doesn\u2019t work that way. We must remember that 30% of what we pay as salaries offshore is variable. The offshore cost is about 15% to 16% of revenues. So 30% of that is variable. That means we have about maybe 4% to 5% of revenues available in the compensation and it is not possible to reduce anybody\u2019s salary. The second thing is that industry-wide like Kris said the salary increase for next year will be very, very muted. I am not sure how many companies are even going to give salary increases. Some companies are talking about not giving any increases. So anyway, in any case it will be very muted because our projects are very much less.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "You know, Mohan, many of the people on this call can confirm that in fact it is possible to reduce salaries, but that is aside, Balakrishnan, this is my last question \u2013", "T.V. Mohandas Pai", "", "No I think \u2013 well there are three things. It depends on what you define as salary. For example, if you have a salary of $100, $50 is variable and $50 is fixed. You get $50 and that is $50 is variable, then they not get it. So there is a large part. But if you say the entire $100 can be reduced, we are told that it requires the contract to be changed because there is an employment contract that has to be changed, people have to be called. And I don\u2019t think we are at a stage when we need to anything like that.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Okay, and then with regard to the use of funds, you know you have quite cash hoard to peers, Balakrishnan, I know you have spoken in the past about relative merits of a dividend versus a repurchase, but could you refresh your thinking about that?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Well, the thinking is same. We don\u2019t need to refresh.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Sorry. Refresh our thinking about your thinking.", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "What we said was we can buy back some dividends. Dividend is better for our shareholders because factoring the hands of shareholders in India. Having said that we want to have sufficient cash in the balance sheet to make sure our growth is not impacted and gives us comfort in the business and we also clearly define what our return expectation in the business. As now the returns are not impacted. We are willing to have cash to give us comfort in the business and make sure the growth is not impacted. And if at some part of time the returns are going to get hurt and if you don\u2019t find alternate use of cash we are willing to return it to our shareholders. We have done it already three times.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "You are referring to special dividends or ordinary?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Well, we have given special dividends in the last 3 instances. So if there is extra cash available in the system where we don\u2019t find any strategic use we will look at that.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Last question please.", "Operator", "", "We will move to a question from Mark Marostica with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "Thank you. It is actually Mark Skitovich for Mark Marostica. Just a couple of clarifications on the hiring front, where do you anticipate net hires to finish this year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "This year the net hires is at about \u2013 we are at about 103,000 and we have said that this quarter we are going to hire about 3,500 and I will just give the figure, just one minute. I think we will hire 3,500.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "3,500 net hires this quarter.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Yes, 3,500 \u2013 yes we said we will hire about \u2013 just hang on for a minute \u2013 quarter four \u2013 yes, we will hire about 3,700 gross that is 3,700 gross. Last quarter we hired a gross addition of 5,997 and the net addition about 2,700. So, we had an attrition of 3,200 people. Out of 3,200 people we had an attrition of about 1,750 or odd in the services business and the balance 1,500 \u2013 I mean 1,400 odd in the BPO business. So the BPO business is still running at an attrition of about 30%-31%. So the BPO may not see any net addition and we have got 1,000 people in the BPO or there could be a slight decline. Even if you assume that 1,500 attrition in the services business and maybe 1,000 in the BPO business that is 2,500 there could be a net increase of maybe 1,000 to 1,200.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. So the net of that you had roughly 19,000 net additions in \u201908. Is that number going to be flat or down or up I guess?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Yes, I think, yes, I think we will hire something like about maybe 18,500 to 19,000 net hires this year and that will be about 103,000 people to end with.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay good .That is helpful. And then just a further clarification on negotiated salaries, for your fresher hires next year, just trying to get clearer here, your \u2013 the salaries that will be negotiated will be flat year-over-year or down to some number and what would that be?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Okay let me \u2013 let me clarify. I got the data here. We ended last year with 91,187 people. Quarter three we are at 103,078. Even if you add maybe 1,000 to 1,200 people we could end up this year with 104,500 that will be about a net addition this year overall for the group or something like about 13,000 people. It is not 19,000, it is 13,000. I am sorry, I got the data right.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "13,000. So that 13,000 is down from the 19,000 net hires last year. Is that the right comparison?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Yes, yes, yes, yes. That is fiscal \u201909, fiscal \u201909; \u201908 to \u201909 will go up from 91,000 to 100 \u2013 and let us say 104,500 [ph] and previous year we had a net hires about 19000. And as far the fresher salary go, the freshers\u2019 salary for the next year is what we offered when we made the offer last year.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. It is already assumed that some of these fresher salaries may be not at Infosys but have been negotiated, renegotiated at lower levels, some 10% to 20%. Is that not the case at Infosys?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No, we have made an offer in the letter to all freshers in colleges last year, because that is what we need to do and we will stick to that offer. When they come and join us we will stick to that offer and the offer is not very different from what was the compensation for freshers in this fiscal year.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. Okay and then just a bit of clarification on visibility. I think I heard you say that you expect telecom, the telecom business to be roughly flat. I am just trying to get a sense of what gives you confidence that it will be flat year-over-year in the current quarter and if that has something to do with your $50 million plus deal pipeline, maybe you can talk a little bit about what sectors contributed to Q3 and what you expect to see contributing to Q4.", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Well, I think overall at the constant currency level, we expect it to be flat. It is what we are seeing. Was there a specific question on that?", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "I am just trying to get a sense of your confidence level in it being flat constant currency. Is the pipeline, the $50 million plus pipeline more concentrated on the telecom side or what gives us confidence that that telecom business should be flat year-over-year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "See, telecom has few large customers. In fact, if we look at the pipeline you know we have 10 large deals in the pipeline. They are two out of that which are in the telecom area. We have not actually factored in that we will win any other large deals at this point because they could take anywhere from 3 months to sometimes 9, 12 months to close. So, we have not factored that in. It is just that we have some large relationships and few customers only in telecom and we have some visibility into this pattern et cetera and that is what gives us the confidence.", "Mark Skitovich - Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Unfortunately we are completely out of time. I want to thank all of you for participating in the call. If you have further questions you can contact Sandeep or Shekar, the investor relationship managers in US and India and we will reply to all your questions. Thank you and see you next quarter or in between in one of the investor meetings or something. Thank you all very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you sir. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and thank you all for your participation. Have a great day."]}

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo. Please go ahead, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys financial results for the quarter and year ending March 31, 2009.", "I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S. D. Shibulal; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of senior management.", "We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter and the year, followed by the outlook for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and year ending March 31, 2010. Subsequently, we will open up the discussion for Q&A. Before I pass it on to the management, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'd now pass it on to Mr. Gopalakrishnan.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks, Sandeep, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone wherever you are. Thanks for participating in this call.", "In spite of a challenging environment, we have met the lower end of our guidance in constant currency terms. Our revenue for the quarter was about $1.121 billion. In constant currency terms, the guidance would have been $1.118 billion to $1.159 billion. So we're just slightly above the lower end of the guidance.", "You know, we faced multiple challenges, you know, growth was a challenge, pricing was a challenge, and the currency volatility was a challenge. In spite of that we have been able to sustain the operating margins for the year. For the quarter, the operating margin declined by 2.3%. We have been able to continue to invest in the business and in this quarter we added about 5000 employees.", "Our attrition has come down. Utilization slightly come down. It is 74.3%, but compared to last quarter it is about a 0.5% drop. We have given a guidance of 3.7% to 5.4% decline next year. In constant currency terms, it will be a decline of about 0% to minus 3% or about flat to minus 3% decline.", "In the operating margins, we are looking at a decline of about 3% for next year, but when you look at the three challenges I talked about, growth, pricing and currency, we have sustained the margins in spite of the challenging environment. Going forward also it is still within a narrow band.", "Given the challenging environment, the guidance factors in a wider range because of the challenging environment, and we believe that the company has managed the challenging environment reasonably well, and is poised to take advantage of the growth that we anticipate when recovery happens. And for the fiscal year 2010, we will continue to add employees. At the gross level it is about 18,000, at the net level probably about 8000, because attrition is expected to be about 10%.", "So at the net level it'll be about 8000 people and this again is something, which we believe we can manage. All these are factored into our guidance and our margins and things like that. We believe that our investment into the future, our investment into solutions IP, our investment to increase sales, you know, we're adding another 1000 \u2013 another 100 people, 100 people in sales next year.", "So all these will help us get growth back when recovery happens. Of course, we are sustaining the margins, and we are managing this currency fluctuation very well. At the beginning of the year, the rupee was at 39 rupees. At the end of the year, the rupee is around 50 rupees per dollar, and still we have been able to sustain the margins. Most other currencies also have depreciated against the dollar, and in spite of that we have been able to sustain the margins.", "So the model is pretty robust. It is resilient and yes, we have been impacted on the growth side and that is because, you know, the impact is growing from the impact on our clients. Most of our clients are telling us that of course their budgets are lower, and the spending on their supplies is over. And that is what is causing the volume decline. Sequentially volume declined by 1.4%, and our guidance now factors in a decline because of that for the fiscal year 2010.", "Now, I will hand it over to Shibulal to give you more detail by the various segments, and give you more details about what is happening in each of those segments.", "S.D. Shibulal", "This is Shibulal. Let me start by giving you some color on the demand situation. We recently conducted a survey of our 135 top clients. They account for 83% of our revenue in LTM basis. We are seeing a high level of uncertainty in the IT budgets for these clients.", "But we conducted a survey about 3 to 4 weeks back. At that time, only 61% had finalized their budgets. Now, majority of the people, the majority of the 135 we surveyed, 89% indicated decreased spending in FY10. So that means the budgets are down for 89%, 69% said that their budgets are down in low-double digits in FY10.", "Offshore continues to be of interest. 22% said that they will increase their offshore spending in FY10, 5% said that they will increase their offshore by more than 10% in FY10. On the same token, we have 69% saying that there will be decreased offshore spending in FY10.", "Recovery is expected to be protracted. 57% of the people who we surveyed, the accounts where we collected the information, said that the recovery will be beyond March 2010, which means the recovery is about 12 to 18 months away.", "Overall, the growth outlook for the clients we surveyed was down by 2%. Where they are spending money, we are seeing that they are spending money on application maintenance, which is (inaudible) work. They are outsourcing and offshoring application maintenance to generate better value. They are spending money on enterprise solutions. I tend to believe that these programs which are multi-year, which have kicked in already or these are programs, which they are kicking in today so that they can emerge stronger when the downturn is over.", "The verticals where we are seeing trouble, we are seeing pressures in banking and capital markets. We are seeing pressure in manufacturing as well as in retail. The energy and utility segment seems to be doing better. We are also expecting that there will be better spend in health care because of all the money going into health care.", "Our utilization levels have come down. Our utilization this quarter is 74.3%, excluding training, down from 74.8% last quarter, and this is a reflection of the demand situation. The utilization in a way is linked to demand. And this shows that the demand is down.", "That is it to my side, I will hand it over to Bala to give you the financial highlights.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning everybody. We had a great quarter. Our revenues were closer to the lower end of the guidance we gave in constant currency. We ended the quarter with $1.12 billion of revenue; the gross margin was 41.9%. It was 43.6% last quarter.", "In this fiscal year, we got the benefit of the currency in the third quarter that is quarter ending December. We allowed the benefit to flow into the margins because we had little time to invest, this quarter we invest. If you look at the operating income, operating margin came to 29.4% from 31.8%. At the net income level, the margins went to 28.5% from 28.3% because on the non-operating side, we had lesser impact because of the currency.", "We had only $3 million of impact coming because of currency, which was higher in the last quarter. Overall, we met the EPS guidance. We gave a guidance of $0.55. We have done $0.56. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash, with accounts receivable days of 57 days. It was 56 days in the third quarter. Slightly gone up, no concerns.", "More than 60% of the receivable is less than 30 days. So we had a great quarter. Last year was an extremely challenging year, because almost all the currencies moved by something between 25% to 30% against the dollar, and the rupee moved something around 26% against the dollar. So, we had an extreme volatile currency environment last year. In spite of that, we are able to maintain the margins or improve on the margins.", "If you look at year-on-year between fiscal \u201808 and fiscal \u201909, our margins went up by around 200 basis points, because we were able to manage the environment much better.", "We have given guidance for next year. Our guidance assumes the revenues could decline by something between 3% to 7% in dollar terms for the full-year, and in Q1 it could decline somewhere between 4% to 5%. We assume the pricing level to remain at the same level like what we saw in the fourth quarter for rest of the \u2013 full-year next year. That means the pricing could decline by something around 6% on a year-on-year basis for next year.", "We're adding 18,000 people, because we have given certain commitments in the campus last year. We want to honor all the commitments, plus we lack some laterals. And we are also investing more money in the sales and marketing. So we want to hire at least 100 people on the sales and marketing side to strengthen our sales team, to make sure that future growth is not impacted.", "So we assume that operating margin could come down by around 300 basis points for full year of next year, because one, the pricing impact will be there. Even if you take the average of fourth quarter to remain the same as \u2013 for the full-year, the pricing could come down by around 5.7%. That could impact the margins. Of course, we will have the benefit of the rupee. At the same time, the utilization could come down because we are assuming a decline in the revenue growth, and we're adding people that could have an impact on the margins.", "So net-net, the operating margins could come down by around 300 basis points for full year of next year, and the net margins could come down by around 200 basis points.", "On a tax rate, I think the effective tax rate for full year of fiscal \u201809 was around 14.7% to 16.5% in the fourth quarter. We are assuming that the effective tax rate will be closer to 16.5% for next year full-year because one, we had higher yield on our cash and cash equivalents in fiscal \u201809, it was 9.6%. Next year it could come down to maybe around 7% to an extent that tax payout could be less.", "And also in our guidance, we assume the currency rate as of March end to be constant for the full-year. So the rupee impact could be there, but it could be more or less neutralized by the pricing decline, and also the utilization decline. So overall we have done well. We had maintained our margins or improved the margins in an extremely volatile economic situation, and also a currency situation and we had done well.", "We are ending the year with $2.2 billion of cash, and we continue to generate higher degree of cash even in this environment.", "I think with this I will conclude my opening remarks. Now we can open up the floor for Q&A.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Lisa, we can take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you sir. (Operator instructions) And we have a question from Bhavan Suri with William Blair and Co.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Co.", "Good morning guys, or good evening your time. I guess a couple of quick questions. The first is what are you seeing on customers coming back and renegotiating existing deals. Sort of what has been the ramp down of existing work?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We're not seeing existing work being rammed down, what we are seeing is that when projects end, we're not unable to replenish the work because of delays in decision-making and lack of demand.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Co.", "And if you look at some of, I think you signed 37 new customers this quarter, were average deal sizes less than what you have seen, how is that looking, and then if you could talk a little bit about the pipe, and what you are seeing on kind of the deal size and the duration of those deals?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Deal sizes are smaller now. Actually what happens is the pipeline continues to be pretty good, the deals start off as large deals $250 million, $300 million et cetera, then during the discussion and negotiation et cetera what happens is either the scope gets reduced, because the client does not want to commit everything at this point. Second, it is possible that then suddenly they decide to make this a multi-vendor deal. And they also quote this high number up front so that they can get better terms and conditions and things like that, but the deal size when it completes, when it closes typically is much, much lower than the starting point.", "The second thing is the time taken for these deals to close. Typically the deal would take six months, now it would probably take 9 to 10 months. So 30%, 40% increase in closure time. The third thing is, you know, the velocity of closure which I talked about. So that does have an impact on growth at this point.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Co.", "And so I guess if you kind of look at kind of your guidance for fiscal 2010, you know, what provides sort of the confidence \u2013 you know, is your visibility, you have typically guided where you have had sort of 70% visibility into your guidance, is that still the case and what do you think about visibility going into this year now?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, you know our model is still the same. We do a bottom-up of building up the forecast. Then we, as you said, we need visibility of 65% for four quarters out, and about 80%, 85% for the next quarter and that is the model we still use. That has not changed. The reason why we are confident of any other guidance we give et cetera are because the model has not changed and you know, yes, growth has come down. So that reflects the market conditions, but the model is still the same.", "Second, we are confident about margins et cetera because the company has shown time and again that we are able to manage margins in a challenging pricing environment, in a challenging currency environment, and so we are confident about margins. We still have many levers, which we can use in order to manage our portfolio such that the margins are sustained. The company is run very efficiently. It has strong customer relationships, you know, as Shibulal said, we're not seeing cancellations. We're not losing clients etc. It is the fact they have ramped down their projects, they have cut their budgets, and hence the volume has come down and that is reflected in our guidance.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Co.", "Great thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Marostica with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Good evening. I was hoping you could provide just maybe a little bit of clarity on the operating margin guidance that you put out, the 300 BIPS, can you sort of talk about what gets you there, does it relate to utilization, volume et cetera. I'm just trying to maybe get a little better clarity, maybe if you can break that out a little bit better.", "V. Balakrishnan", "See, we had assumed that the pricing for the fourth quarter could remain constant for the next full year, because that is what we do every year. We factor in only the knowns, not the unknowns. So if you do that, pricing on a year-on-year basis could come down by around 6%. That could have an impact on operating margin of around 3%. The rupee could be beneficial because last year, that is fiscal 2009 the average rupee dollar rate was around 46.50 or so. Next year it was running 50.70. That would give a benefit of around 4.5%. Then the utilization could come down, because we are assuming a decline in revenues by around 3% to 7% for the full year. At the same time, we're adding around 18,000 people, because we want to ensure all the commitments are fulfilled.", "So net-net, the utilization impact could be there. So overall, the operating margin could come down by around 300 basis points because of all these factors.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "So, just so I understand that right, so you are assuming in that 300 BIPS there is roughly a 4.5% rupee benefit?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and then just shifting to geographies, just \u2013 you\u2019re obviously seeing Europe come down at a greater pace than US, I'm just curious can you \u2013 when you talk about your visibility, you know 65% out, how does that look in Europe relative to North America?", "Unidentified Participant", "(inaudible) Overall, for the year in Europe, again if you look at Europe, UK, as well as the Continent Europe, in the continent we saw a significant growth year-on-year, 26% growth in reported currency terms. However, the decline in UK, specific to 2, 3 sectors has offset the growth in the continent. For the full year, last fiscal year, we added $100 million in the continent incremental revenue. So that has been the overall number. In terms of the global, and the percentage of global revenues in constant currency terms, it is 25% of revenues from Europe. Specific to sectors, as we look forward for the coming fiscals, we still see (inaudible) opportunities in pharmaceuticals, in specific sectors within manufacturing including resources and aerospace, in CPG clients in the continent Europe.", "Telecom is a mixed bag. Some of our clients are doing well and they continue to invest into the future, and we will still see that translating into dollar revenue for Infosys. Apart from that, we are also seeing substance and also growth coming from energy and utilities. This cuts across both UK and the continent.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. Thank you. And just one quick final question, of your top 10 clients, are there any clients that are indicating budget cuts in excess of the 9% average that you're seeing among your client base?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Not in the top 10, if you look at our client survey of 135 clients, about 89% of that have said decrease and about 69% have said that maybe 10% or more but the top 10, it is not \u2013 in the top 10 now, we believe the top 10 will be actually around 3% to 5% that is all.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "Hi, guys. My first question here is just statically [ph] and historically there has been a link between headcount and revenues, I was just curious, you are obviously going to add people but the guidance is for low volumes, (inaudible) reconcile that?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The reason for continuing to add people are two-fold, one, last April before anybody saw this downturn coming; we had gone to campuses and made 20,000 offers. Remember that our Q2 fiscal 2009 was one of the best quarters we had. We saw a sequential growth of almost 6%, and so we had made those offers, and right now we feel that it is important that we give a commitment \u2013 we gave a commitment so we need to honor those commitments, and we are asking those people to join. They will join starting July, August and we have extended the training, so the training is now almost 6 months long.", "So they will come out actually starting Jan, Feb 2010. So let us say the recovery starts, and we are in a better position. So that is what we had thought. The second thing is net of attrition the 18,000 gross number actually comes down to 8000, and so the impact on utilization is not that much.", "And lastly the impact on margin, yes, it is there. But still it is not significant. So when we look at our brand, our commitment, the goodwill we build with these campuses et cetera. And be prepared for the future, we believe that this is the right thing that we should be doing and that is so we have gone ahead and done this.", "So yes we understand, yes, the revenue is slightly down. That is what we have predicted. But still we're adding people.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "And on the tax rate side, what was your expectation for tax rate for next year?", "V. Balakrishnan", "If you look at the effective tax rate, it was around 16.5% in the Q4, if you remove the tax reversal. And for the full year it was 14.7%. So for next full year, it could be close to 16% to 16.5%, because one, the yield on the cash and cash equivalents could come down. We had an effective yield of 9.6% in fiscal 09. It could come down to maybe around 7%. So to that extent the impact could be lessened. At the same time, some of the units which are operating under the STP scheme could come out of the scheme. So net-net overall the effective tax rate could go up somewhere from 14.7% in fiscal \u201809 to somewhere between 16% and 16.5% in fiscal 2010.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "Okay and then just lastly typically going into the year, and obviously the economy has gotten much worse. You guys have tended to be \u2013 and going through your (inaudible) models, maybe a little bit on the conservative side, is that the case this year, in other words have you changed your guidance method at all for looking at revenue numbers in your opinion?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No. Our methodology for giving guidance still remains the same. It is a bottom-up exercise. We collect data from the field of what our clients are telling us, what they will be spending with this et cetera. Add it all up, and we need as we said about 65%, 70% visibility for the next year, and based on that we come up with guidance. We then also verify this with analyst reports and things like that. We have other sources of looking at this data, and then that is how we come up with our guidance. It is neither conservative nor aggressive. It is a reflection of the data we have and the model we have. It factors in that growth has come down, so that is what we have come up.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery", "Thank you.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Lisa, can we take the next question?", "Operator", "Thank you sir. The next question comes from George Price of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thanks very much. Just kind of piggybacking on Joe\u2019s \u2013 one of his questions, any thoughts on the tax rate going into fiscal \u201911. I know that is way out, but going into fiscal \u201811 on the other side of the STPI exemption falling off, based on your current fiscal \u201810 growth outlook, and the STPI footprint that you see?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, on the incremental growth (inaudible), but still the growth for fiscal 2010 is guided to be declining by 3% to 7%. It may not change materially for fiscal 2010. And fiscal 2010 and is the last year for STPI tax holiday. We don't know whether the government will extend it. If they don't do it, in fiscal 2011 quite possible the effective tax rate could go to somewhere between 20% and 22%.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Is \u2013 I think that is a range that you have talked \u2013 that you have thrown out at least loosely previously. You know, given what I think is probably a, at least a modestly disappointing growth outlook now versus say a 6 or 12 months ago, doesn\u2019t that suggest that you are going to have less incremental growth going into SEZs and the tax rate could actually go higher?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, it could but if you look at the associated [ph] revenues, because 5% of our overall revenues. Now it has gone up to 9%, 10% of our overall revenues. Third, the extent of the impact could be lesser, that is why I'm stating a range of 20% to 22%.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, just wanted to clarify something, there was some mention about investing more money in sales and marketing, and I think I heard 1000 people, and then a 100 people more. Is it 100?", "V. Balakrishnan", "It is 100 people more for sales, 100. The thousand is, in this 18,000 gross additions, about 16,000 are at entry-level, and about 2000 are experienced hires. Out of those 2000, we plan to hire half of that about 1000 outside the country, primarily in North America, in the US.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, got you. Could you talk about how demand, your demand outlook, you know, tracked may be on a monthly basis as you went through the quarter, January versus February, February versus March, just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, try and get a sense of how the client mindset on the year forward evolved as we move forward?", "V. Balakrishnan", "So, you know, in the beginning of the year, I'm not comparing January to April. January most companies had not finalized their budgets. There was confusion about the budgets et cetera. Now about four weeks back, it was about 61%, now we believe at least about 70% of the companies have finalized their budgets. Even where they have finalized their budgets, they are telling us that they will allocate money on a monthly basis in most cases and they may not spend all that money. So that is one data point.", "The second is about 22% of the companies we talk to tell us that will increase, but remaining 78% are saying that everything is affected including offshore. So that is the second data point we have. So, come from January to now there is a significant improvement in the situation with respect to demand.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess the way I was thinking about is has there been a significant deterioration in the outlook as you from the \u2013 when you entered the quarter as to when you left it?", "V. Balakrishnan", "If you look at the pipeline, the pipeline still continues to be pretty robust and strong. It is just that the closure is taking much longer. As I said, previously basically it took six months, it is taking nine months, and the pipeline is actually pretty robust. We added 37 clients in Q4, a similar number from Q3. So the customer additions still continue to be very strong. We have not lost any customer, no projects got cancelled. So there are positives and negatives. The negative is cuts in budget, maybe cut in offshore also, delays in decision-making, budget closures taking much longer, pricing pressure. These are the differences let us say six-months back to now.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, last question pricing assumptions you are saying remains flat with levels in fiscal 4Q09, and I guess given the environment and given your comments about how clients are \u2013 most clients are cutting back on rolling on a monthly basis, and may not spend all of their budgets, and things this could last into 2010. Is that a conservative enough assumption at this point? I mean, why won\u2019t pricing deteriorate further from fiscal fourth-quarter levels?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Again, you know anything could happen in this environment. Now we have based this on our discussions and what we know today. So it is based on what we know today. Many of the negotiations we believe are behind us. So that \u2013 we have seen the impact, clients have reacted pretty fast to the deteriorating environment. This started somewhere in September middle. So they have reacted pretty fast, and we believe that a significant number of these are behind us. There is always a possibility that they will come back and renegotiate. It is possible. And we have to wait and see.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi guys. One of the things I was wondering about the timing of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2010. Obviously, we're expecting to be down into the June quarter, when do you guys expect to see a constant currency sequential improvement in the revenue growth through the course of fiscal \u201910?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "From second quarter onwards a slight increase, we are predicting a slight increase, not a great increase may be about 1% to 2% that is what we have assumed at this point.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay got it, and when you look at the existing client base that you have, in the survey data that you guys compiled, did you guys get any sense on potential client share shifts away from you, in other words are you seeing more competition in some of your larger clients, especially where it appears that wasn't as much growth. Could you possibly have lost some momentum to wild share shifts to some competitors?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You see, no, we've not lost any major client or any major project. We have worked very hard at it. Of course, there is some luck because at least till now none of our clients have completely gone bankrupt. They have been acquired of course, and we've been benefiting from some of those acquisitions. So I think it is a combination of our relationship, hard work, and some luck.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then maybe for Bala, what was the level of doubtful accounts that you guys are reserving for at this point and where they are [ph]?", "V. Balakrishnan", "It is very small. I mean, we provide for all account receivables, which are more than 180 days. We also provide for receivables, which are doubtful. In the fourth quarter, we made a provision of around $4 million. For the full year, we made a provision of $16 million. So it is not very big compared to the kind of receivables we have.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then if, I am not sure who would be best to comment on this, but can you guys talk specifically to \u2013 I guess I'm trying to find if there is any linkage at all between some of the backlash impact that we are seeing in terms of the political environment here in the United States, especially on some of the TARP clients, how much of that is sort of spilling into the longer sales cycles or even delays or hesitancy from the clients to actually ramp up or just given sort of the kind of political backdrop that we are seeing right now here. Can you guys address that directly please?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, this is Chris here. We have not seen any impact till now, at this point. If you look at the number of visas being applied, this is the H-1 season right. The numbers have not exceeded the limit. So less number of visas are being applied. So we have not seeing an impact when I think Congress also put a condition that companies who have taken TARP money should not use H-1B, they did not say should not outsource.", "So we have not seen an impact now. Again, this is definitely an area where we are watching the situation. It is possible that some new regulation may come in this regard. It is possible, but in the past we have seen the impact has not been there.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay and just finally, can you provide some sense on what has cost you guys to carry a bench of freshers who are in training, any sort of range for what the actual carrying costs (inaudible) but not have them build out?", "V. Balakrishnan", "It is about $5000 per year of carrying cost per employee in training approximately.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, got it. Thanks guys. Good luck.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Caso with Wachovia Securities?", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Hi, thank you and good evening. Following on on Julio\u2019s question here, what steps are you taking to sort of address the growing protectionist environment in the US, I mean are you hoping to hire more native set of more officers here, give us some thoughts please?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know, it will be a combination of multiple things. We have to look at hiring more employees in the US. One of the things I said was that out of the 2000 experienced hires, we're looking at 1000 outside India. Second is shifting more work offshore. We have seen this in the past that when it becomes difficult to get H-1 et cetera, clients actually are willing to come to India and work with us in India. So those are again some of the possibilities. The third is, near shore [ph] centers, we have a center in Canada; we have a center in Mexico. So there are multiple options that we can use.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Can you talk a little bit about what is happening with Satyam, how that is impacting your business, particularly in regard to maybe any moves on their part or others to be more aggressive on pricing?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We are glad that this issue is now put behind us, resolved. The Government of India has acted very quickly to bring in a new owner and things like that. We have always had competition, you know, both companies were competition, now they have joined together, but we believe that it is not anything new. We know these companies, we have competed well and we will continue to do well against all kinds of competition. We have done this many times. So there is a confidence here that we can manage competition.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Can you talk a little bit about any consolidation and what you are seeing, and particularly how maybe irrational in pricing some say smaller buyers might be at this time?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, we've not seen significant amount of consolidation. There is some cross-border acquisition, Satyam is a case where there is some consolidation within the same geography, but by and large most of the acquisitions have been cross-border. This industry always had a long tail. In Bangalore alone there are 1000 companies registered. Across India there are more than 8000 companies registered in the IT space, and even in the US, it is therefore a handful of companies who are seen as leaders in this industry. There have been hundreds and thousands of companies who have \u2013 who have been there actually and some continue to do well, some continue to just stay around et cetera. So, this industry has always had a pretty long tail.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company. Mr. Katri, your line is open. Mr. Katri, your line is open.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Lisa, let us move to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. The next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had three, first about Infosys BPO, it seems like that did have a good quarter, the operating margin there was better in the fourth quarter than it was any time prior in the year, I was wondering Balakrishnan, if you might give some give some commentary about Infosys BPO\u2019s operating margins?", "V. Balakrishnan", "We have Amitabh Chaudhry, who is the CEO of Infosys BPO. I am going to ask him to respond.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Oh, great.", "Amitabh Chaudhry", "Hi, yes, I think this quarter we did I would say a good one, but not in the sense that we had a negative growth in the third quarter and this quarter we have grown by 3.1% quarter-on-quarter. Our operating margin moved up, partly helped by the fact that the rupee continued to depreciate, and we benefited from that. Over and above that, we also have been improving our utilization in a very significant way over the last couple of quarters and we benefited from the improved utilization.", "So the combined impact of you know, the rupee depreciation, the fact that we were able to hold our prices. The asset utilization went up and as we were able to manage our workforce well. We have seen obviously, we had an impact on that on operating margin. Also please understand that the Philips deal, which we did in October \u201907, the possibility of that deal continues to improve, and we are again benefiting from that and so is our operations in international centers. So that is the other factor, which is helping us improving our operating margins.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. If I could just ask related to that. Is Philips a top 5 customer?", "Amitabh Chaudhry", "Yes, for BPO it is.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Thank you. And then I wanted to say going into consulting. So that\u2019s a less sanguine subject. You know, the Infosys consulting division appears to have lost about $6 million to $7 million in the quarter. And you know, I guess as it \u2013 if you could share any observations, is there a light at the end of the tunnel there, it looks to us like the fiscal fourth quarter was, you know, maybe the worst in the year in terms of the losses, because you only lost $12 million in that year, but you lost $7 million in the quarter, so what\u2019s going on there?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The IT subsidiary has no meaning anymore in the business environment. It is a subsidiary which holds a bunch of people, it was created long time back and it is kept there because of employee contracts and various other factors. Today, consulting operates across IT subsidiary [ph] and ITL, there are a lot of people in ITL who work with the consulting at one single unit. So as a group, one has to look at the MIS [ph] numbers rather than the numbers published for that subsidiary. And the MIS numbers are very different from what you will see in the subsidiary numbers, so that there is no reason to look at the subsidiary numbers.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay, I apologize. I had a \u2013", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No, no, no. It is just simply that today you know, if you remember one year back, we mentioned that we have created one group by consolidating the consulting and solution space, and the solutions people were created as a separate unit with ITL and merged with ITL and MIS business, but it was never moved. So, it spans across the organization, and the net income is 2% to 3% if I look at the MIS report.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay, and then if I could sneak in one last one about products, which is cynical. So it looks like that generated about $45 million in the quarter. You know, so that looks like a pretty good quarter on the \u2013 like the products in the software Finacle, what can we expect I guess for that. You know, it seems like software is going to harder sales in this environment. Is that $45 million? Is that sustainable going forward or should we expect that to trend down?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Finacle is doing extremely well, actually it is finding good traction. Haragopal, who heads our Finacle group is here. So I am going to let him answer this question. Haragopal.", "Haragopal", "Hi, yes like Chris said we are seeing good traction including the markets like the U.S. as well as U.K. Having said that some of the decisions are taking longer than you know, what we would expect, you know, including in some of the decisions of Q3 spilling over to Q4. Secondly, you know some of these decisions we are looking at in a staggered fashion, going in a phased deployment and which is \u2013 it is not that wholesome transformation in one goal. So, overall I think in some geographies we were seeing a slowdown in some of the markets, definitely it is picking up, some segments, typically the tier one, there aren\u2019t quick deficiencies yet, but the mid-segment banks are really looking at the transmission using Finacle as the platform.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Thank you so much.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know, just to add to that Finacle has had sales now in North America, in U.S., in Europe, in Australia, in Singapore. So you know, it is now finding traction in developed markets. We are working with medium to large-sized banks. So you know, it is progressing, and its level at which is now is selling. And we are also getting multi-country role outs, where Finacle is being used as a standard, and there were phased manner in which they implement. They implement in smaller countries first, and then slowly migrate to home country. So you know, Finacle is actually doing very well at this point.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "Thank you for taking my question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Great. It looks like the pricing environment was somewhat of a surprise over the last three months, given the change in tone on the pricing front. As a result of the pricing environment and other competitive dynamics out there, is Infosys changing its competitive and financial strategy in anyway to address that environment?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, in spite of challenging pricing, if you look at the actual impact, it is minus 1.4% in Q3 and minus 2% in Q4. So we have handled it, you know reasonably well. We\u2019ve been able to sustain margins, and the impact is there but it is not you know, that much. Having said that you know, we are giving our clients many more options and choices, increased offshore fixed pricing, you know other pricing models like pricing based on tickets or number of maintenance requests or number of devices we manage.", "We also have platform-based solutions where we take the initial investment and the client base for use. So we are giving them multiple choices so that you know, they can look at what they want to achieve, what their goals are, and still we are able to through productivity improvement or through efficiencies of scale to creating a shared services model. We are able to also get, you know, the margins we want. So we have been able to do this smartly and the bottom line is actually the bottom line itself. You know, we have been able to sustain the margins.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "That makes sense. I guess so on top of that, I mean it looks like you are increasing your aggression in investment in sales and marketing, and that may be somewhat of a reaction to the environment that we are in, where are trying to invest more aggressively to preserve your market share in the offshore market. So I guess the question there is, is the increased investment and things like sales and marketing, is that a temporary investment just for the current environment, or is that a level of investment that likely to reflect a more permanent part of your cost structure and then essentially a change somewhat in your strategy?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, typically we would, you know, invest in sales and marketing along with growth. Since growth is not there, we believe that to kick-start growth, you know, we have to invest and you know, and in normal years because of the growth, you know the percentage will not change, but here when the growth is not there, the percentage would change. These investments are into new areas. You know, we want to enter new markets, we want to enter into new industry vertical, we want to look at you know, public sector government. So there are various things we need to do. On an ongoing basis to expand the market footprint we have, the industry footprint we have, et cetera. We are also investing in solutions and new services that will require investment in sales. So the remaining reasons why this is required, you know, it is part of the plan and when the growth comes back, you will see that you know, as a percentage it will drop back to traditional levels.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Are you increasing your investment in kind of onshore relationship management type function to have more sort of account management and sort of vertical expertise, you know, more so with the client?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, we are \u2013 but again, you know over time we will balance that. You know we\u2019ve done this very well because you know when we do these investments, we also simultaneously tweak the models such that you know, we are able to get back the margin. See, what I think we have demonstrated very well over many, many years is that despite currency movement, despite changes in business, et cetera. you know our ability to sustain margin is pretty good, and that\u2019s because you know, we have several levers. For example, today you know if you look at utilizations come down, traditionally we would look at utilization of 78% to 80%. That is just one example of you know, the levers we still have within the business.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "You may be suggesting there that the 300 basis points of margin degradation in your outlook is a potentially overly conservative outlook. I mean you are getting over 400 basis points of benefit from the rupee, but still guiding to 300 basis points of margin contraction. So that\u2019s a pretty meaningful change in the margin structure unless that\u2019s a highly, highly conservative kind of outlook.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No it is not conservative or aggressive or anything that you know, the model we have. As we said, you know, we are increasing our sales. We have reduced, you know, the utilization is going to be lower, and then the pricing impact will be felt. So it is based on the data we have and the model we have, and that\u2019s what it is about. Our aim always has been to get, you know the highest margins in our industry, or one of the highest margins in the industry. In the industry, you will have a range of margins, and to get to the soft end of that, you know, always our aim. It is a self-driven thing, you know it is not something, you know, something which somebody outside is telling us, this is the philosophy of the company always.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "You definitely deserve credit.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "And we have demonstrated that we are able to do that. Even in BPO, if you look at BPO margins, you know, we have again one of the highest. You know, it is a business, which was started five to six years back, and again we are one of the highest margins in the industry. Nobody has anywhere close to that margins in BPO.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes, the margins are definitely impressive relative to the rest of the industry. One of the things that came up on the 4:30 a.m. conference call, and that\u2019s Eastern timeframe. The \u2013 there was some indication that there might be a bit of a recovery happening in the financial services vertical, and I just wanted to maybe even Ashok could elaborate on that. I mean, we are seeing maybe some stabilization where things are not dropping at the same rate in that vertical, but it is unclear to me that there\u2019s really a recovery happening. So not to fight over (inaudible), and without looking at analyst reports and things that are out there, are you guys seeing a recovery or a stabilization type of a scenario there?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know, let me explain. You know, what we said was if you look at the results announced by some of the banks, et cetera. there seem to be some maybe stabilization recovery. You know, I saw some news reports where you know regulators of government officials in the U.S. saying that maybe this is a start of a recovery. All I said was from the data we have, which is based on our client survey, etc. we are not assuming any recovery.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Got it.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We are assuming that first quarter is going to be tough quarter. It is a sequential decline again, but at some point the recovery must happen, and if that happens it will be positive. That\u2019s what I said, but there are some signs there, out there saying that you know, it maybe a start of the recovery. I said that let\u2019s hope that you know, it is true, it is real and it sustained. So let\u2019s see that.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the clarification.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Unfortunately, we are completely out of time. I want to thank everyone for participating in the call. Our investment relationship managers are always there to answer any further questions you have, and we look forward to interacting with you doing the quarter or at the end of the next quarter. Thank you again.", "Operator", "And that concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. Have a good day."]}

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference to Sandeep Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Good morning everyone, and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys\u2019 financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2009.  I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York.  Joining us today on this call is our CEO and MD, Mr. Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan along with other members of the senior management.  ", "We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter ending September 30, 2009, and year ending March 31, 2010.  Subsequently, we will open up the discussion for Q&A.", "Before I pass it onto management team, I would like to remind you that anything we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement and must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available with our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now pass it on to Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan.", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thank you for joining us for this call at the end of Q1.  We exceeded the higher end of our guidance by 3.9%.  Our guidance was $1.06 to $1.08, and we did $1.12.  Revenue increased sequentially by 0.1%.  Of course, in constant currency, it declined.  Volume declined sequentially by 1.1%.  It\u2019s slightly better than what we had projected at the beginning of the quarter.  ", "On-site volumes declined by 2.1, offshore volumes declined by 0.6.  In constant currency terms, the revenue per employee has come down by about 1%.  Utilization is slightly lower, but given where we are, given the environment in which we are operating today, we feel we\u2019ve been able to execute this quarter reasonably well.  We\u2019ve increased operating margin by about 0.7%.  We\u2019ve added 27 clients.  We\u2019ve had three large what we call outsourcing deals.  We have won three transformation deals.  We continue to add employees.  We continue to invest in sales and marketing.  We continue to invest in solutions and IP.  We have capacity.  We see growth opportunities.  We can take advantage of that, and our ability to manage the margins in these circumstances gives us the confidence that we would be in a strong position.", "If I look at the environment, medium to long-term, we still believe in the growth story for the industry.  In the short term, it is going to be volatile.  It\u2019s going to be challenging.  It\u2019s going to be unpredictable, and that\u2019s why if you look at our guidance, in dollar terms, we did not revise the upper end of the guidance.  The lower end of the guidance reflects what happened in the first quarter.  It has been increased by about $100 million.  At the EPS level, for the full year, we\u2019re saying $1.97 to $2.00.  It is a sequential decline from last quarter, and we feel very cautious in the short terms but optimistic in the medium to long-term.  ", "When we discuss with our clients, they were actually probably more upbeat a couple of weeks back.  In the last two weeks, sentiment may have become a little bit negative.  They also tell us that recovery will be sometime in 2010, beyond this fiscal for us.  So we want to be cautious at this point, and that is reflected in our guidance.  The currency is fluctuating, quite volatile.  We have benefited from currency movements, and Bala will explain the details this quarter.  ", "Our philosophy always has been to take the exchange rate at the last day of the quarter and project, so whatever is reflected includes what has happened in the first quarter, but it\u2019s based on the last day\u2019s exchange rate, and what is seen now is our guidance based on the current economic environment.  ", "Now, I\u2019ll pass it onto my colleague, Shibulal, to give you more segmentation details.", "", "S. D. Shibulal", "I will just start with the pricing environment.  The pricing environment continues to be challenging.  We have an increase in our revenue per person this quarter\u20141% in total currency.  This is after a decline of 3% in Q4\u2014the last quarter, but in constant currency terms, actually the revenue per person has declined by 0.9%.  The pricing continues to be challenging.  At the same time, we believe that most of the negotiations are over, at least for phase 1.  It doesn\u2019t mean that there will not be a second round of negotiations.  That will depend on the economic situation going forward.", "Utilization is 70.1% compared with 74.3% in the last quarter.  This is excluding trainees.  We have honored all the commitments which we gave to campus.  People have joined.  Gross addition this quarter has been 3500 plus.  Net addition is negative actually\u2014900 plus.  The attrition is 11.1%, which includes an involuntary attrition of 2.9%.  ", "Client additions: We have added 27 new clients this quarter, two of whom are Fortune 500.  We have 330 million-dollar clients, giving us $1 million in LTM basis; 19 clients giving us more than $50 million; and 4 clients giving us more than $100 million.  Our total active number of clients is 569 as of this quarter.", "Revenue breakup:  There is an increase in maintenance revenue as a percentage.  It has gone up from 21.7% in the last quarter to 23.2% this quarter.  This is very much in line with what we believe what the clients are trying to do.  We are trying to reduce their total cost of ownership of lights-on work.  So they are trying to convert their fixed costs to variable costs as well as do some partner consolations which is showing up as increased revenue in application maintenance.", "Meanwhile, the consulting revenue has dropped from 25.4% to 24.4%.  This is a reflection of the tightness in the discretionary spend.  As far as vertical split is concerned, most of them have remained stable.  Insurance, banking, and financial services gave us 33% this quarter, exactly the same as what is was last quarter.  There is a marginal increase in telecom\u201416.9% this quarter compared with 16.7% last quarter.  Geographies remained pretty stable.  North America is 64.7% of the revenue\u2014again quite stable compared with last quarter.  ", "With that, let me hand over to Bala for the financial updates.", "", "V. Balakrishnan", "This quarter has been extremely good\u2014much better than what we expected.  In the beginning of the quarter, we said we\u2019ll have revenue of $1060 to $1080 million.  We did $1122 million because we got some benefit because of the cross currency movement of something around $23-$24 million.  The rest of it is due to better volumes and pricing than what we expected in the beginning of the quarter.  We had a gross profit of 42.7%.  Last quarter, it was 42%.  The sales and marketing expense remained constant, and our operating income was 30.1%.  Last quarter, it was 29.5%.  ", "If you remember in the beginning of the quarter, we said for full year the operating margin could come down by around 300 basis points because we want to make arrangements outside India, want to hire locals in all the markets we operate, and we also want to put more money on sales and marketing.  Those investments have not happened in the first quarter.  In the next three quarters, we\u2019ll be making those investments, and we also reconfigured those costs.  So net-net, for the full year from the earlier expectation of 300 basis point drop in operating margin, it could be something around 150 basis point drop in operating margin.  So to that extent the effective tax rate could go up from 17% to 20% that is already factored in the guidance.  ", "For the current quarter, our net margin was 27.9%.  Last quarter, it was 28.6%.  All the subsidiaries did well this quarter, except for consulting which still made a loss of $2.5 million.  Most of the other subsidiaries turned profitable, and to some extent, that improved our margins.  For the full year, we have revised our guidance at the lower end\u2014not in the upper end.  We revised upwards the lower end guidance by $100 million.  We want to keep the upper end of the guidance at the same level because we believe that uncertainty in the environment still continues, and we don\u2019t want to go overboard.", "On the currency side, the rupee appreciated by around 3% this quarter.  Technically it should have impacted our margin by around 1.2%, but the cross currency movement has benefited us, so we\u2019ve not seen larger impact of currency movement on the operating margins because the rupee movement has been offset by the cross currency movement.  At the operating margin, we had an impact of $8 million because of the currency.  At the non-operating level, we had a benefit of $7 million because we had a translation impact of $13 million which was offset by hedging benefit of $19 million.  ", "Net-net at the net income level, the impact due to currency is only $1 million.  We have a hedging position of $598 million at the end of the quarter.  Last quarter end, we had $506 million.  We continue with our strategy of hedging for the next two quarters at any point of time.  We don\u2019t want to go beyond that because the volatility in currency is huge, and if you take a long-term view, it could hurt us.  For example, this quarter, the Australian dollar moved by around 15%, Euro moved by around 5%, and UK pound moved by around 8%.  So in this kind of volatile situation, there is no point in taking a long-term view, so we\u2019ll continue to take a short term view and cover our exposure for the next two quarters.  ", "We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash.  Our DSOs are under control.  DSO days are 56 days, only 5% of the receivable are more than 90 days.  So all in all, it was a great quarter.  We want to be cautious for the full year, and that is reflected in our guidance.", "With this I conclude.  Now, we can now open the floor for Q&A.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Our first question is from the line of George Price with Stifel Nicolaus.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "The fiscal \u201910 constant currency revenue growth guidance I understand is coming down versus what was given last quarter despite better than expected volume performance in the quarter and what looks like a reduced pricing headwind.  Why is that?  What\u2019s changed in the view over the next three quarters to cause that?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "It\u2019s basically because we don\u2019t want to change the guidance at this point of time.  We know that with constant currency it is slightly coming down from what we guided in April, but at the end of the day, the uncertainty in the environment continues.  Even though we\u2019ve done well in the first quarter, we don\u2019t want to increase the guidance in the next three quarters.  We want to wait and see how the whole environment changes because even though there is some positive news coming at the macro level, at the micro level, things have not changed much.  So basically, we want to be more cautious, so we\u2019ve not changed the dollar guidance.  If that reflects a small decline in constant currency, that\u2019s it.", "S. Gopalakrishnan ", "Just to add to that, if we look at our first quarter, there is a volume decline of about 1%, and since there is a volume decline, it is not growth, so we said let us be cautious at this point.  So it turns out to be flat actually for the rest of the three quarters.  Previously we had said that there would be slight growth in the next three quarters.  Now it\u2019s actually flat for the next three quarters, and the net result of that is in constant currency terms a slight decline.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "The lower constant currency is primarily a volume issue?  Is that just a slower than expected ramp-up?", "S. Gopalakrishnan ", "No.  Basically we want to be cautious because there was a volume decline of 1% in the first quarter.  We believe that things have not stabilized in the environment, so we are more cautious about the environment.  That is reflected in the guidance.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Bala, could you just step us through the specific new drivers of the 150 basis points of operating margin decline in fiscal \u201910?  What\u2019s the new expectation on pricing impact, operating margin in the year, currency utilization, investment, and that kind of stuff?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Earlier we said we could be spending close to 300 basis points for the two initiatives which we spoke about\u2014one is onsite hiring in all the geographies where we operate.  Second one is increased spending on sales and marketing.  In the first quarter, we were not able to spend that because it takes some time to spend money.  In the next three quarters, we could be spending that, and it could spill over to next year.  We also reworked the cost based on the current realities, and the revised expectation is the impact would be around 150 basis points on the margins.  ", "On the utilization side, we are still going out with the 18,000 hiring which we said in April, so utilization could come down for the full year.  We are keeping the model ready.  We\u2019re keeping the people trained, so if there is a turn in the environment, we\u2019ll be better positioned to take the growth.  Onsite-offshore mix, we are assuming the same level of first quarter to remain for the next three quarters.  Normally our guidance assumes the same pricing level of what we see in the earlier quarter for the rest of the year, so whatever pricing level in the first quarter we assume that to remain constant for the next three quarters in our guidance.  Currency rate, we normally taken the quarter-end rate and assume that to be remaining constant for the rest of the year because these are variables which we don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to move.  So all those factors are reflected in the guidance, and the revised guidance fully reflects all these assumptions.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Typically, you can break those out in terms of the basis points either hit or benefit to get us to the delta in the operating margin.  Can you do that based on the new assumptions?", "", "V. Balakrishnan", "Those assumptions remain.  For every 1% utilization, there will be a 40 basis point impact.  For every 1% move in rupee-dollar rate, there is a 40-basis point impact on operating margin.  Those assumptions remain same, but the variability will be a percentage of those.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "When you say the costs of the investments you intend to make have been reconfigured, obviously they\u2019re lower, but can you give a little bit more detail as to why they\u2019re lower?  What investment you\u2019re not ultimately making?", "", "V. Balakrishnan", "That will be too much of detail.  There are two initiatives which have reworked the costs and also it got deferred for the next two to three quarters, and overall reduction is 150 basis points.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "As you go forward, how should we think about how they\u2019re going to impact margins on a quarterly basis as we move to fiscal \u201910?  Are investments going to be more weighted to the back half of the fiscal year, or are they going to be relatively evenly distributed?  Any color along those lines?", "S. Gopalakrishnan ", "We\u2019ve given you the margin figures and the EPS figures, so it is reflected, and we\u2019ve given you for the next quarter also.  So it is there.  The numbers are there actually.  Bala, do you want to add anything?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No.  We\u2019ve given the guidance for this year.  Whatever will happen for the next three quarters is already factored in that.  What\u2019ll happen next year, we\u2019ll say somewhere in April next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo.", " ", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "I\u2019m just trying to get some clarification on the higher tax rate.  Is that because of your flat revenue assumptions and that means less work is going to SEZs and your having some of your STPI facilities hit their 10-year targets?  So because of this lack of growth, you\u2019re sort of having a mix problem with your tax rate?  Is that the right interpretation?", "S. Gopalakrishnan ", "Tax rate normally changes when more revenues come out of that tax holiday.  This year, some of the units are getting out of the tax holiday.  When we gave the guidance, we are assuming the margins to come down by around 300 basis points.  To that extent, the tax outflow was less.  That\u2019s we said 16.5-17%.  Now that margins are going up by 150 basis points from the earlier assumption, to that extent, the effective tax rate could go up by around 2%.  So it could be between 19-20%.  We assume 20% because it depends on the growth.  If incremental growth comes in, that could go into SEZs.  We have to see how much of incremental growth is going to come, how the mix is going to change.  Right now, I think it is safer to assume 20% because the margins went up and the effective tax rate has to go up.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "My other question is on the H1b visa issuance, I believe you dramatically reduced that number this quarter versus a year ago.  What kind of expense implications did that have in the June quarter?", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan ", "", "The demand is flatter at this point.  In fact, volumes came down a little bit, and so our need for additional visas has also come down, and that\u2019s the only thing.  We anticipated that the quota would not get filled up because the demand is low, and in fact, the quota has not filled up.  I am told that the number of visas applied is about 45,000 out of the 85,000 or so.  We felt that we could just in time if need be, and so we did not apply for the number that normally we would have applied.  We have sufficient visas at this point, and that\u2019s really not a concern.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Bala, what is the financial impact in the quarter?", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Last year in the first quarter, I think had some $15 million in visa costs.  This quarter, I think it\u2019s around $4-$5 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zutovich with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Zutovich \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Just a followup to the earlier question about the reduced investment.  I\u2019m just wondering if this sort of parallels with your slightly more cautiousness for the year?  Simply put, are you reducing your investments because you\u2019re just not seeing the return there, and then could you also talk about what the mix of that 150 basis points will be broken out between investment outside India and in the selling and marketing line?", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "We are cautious at this point.  We\u2019re very clear there.  The environment continues to be challenging, and we\u2019re cautious.  We want to make sure that of course the investments give us return in the medium to long-term.  We don\u2019t expect it to give us returns in the short term.  These are sales investments, these are recruitments in the market, so all these are actually outside.  In India, we\u2019ve already factored in 16,000, and that\u2019s all factored in.  Lower utilization, that\u2019s factored in.  So these are primarily outside India.  We had in the beginning said we will recruit about 100 people onsite, 1000 people outside India.  It is taking more time for us.  As Bala said, some of this is getting shifted, may even get shifted to the next fiscal year.  That\u2019s partly the reason.  Second is we continue to run the business as efficiently as possible.  One of the other examples we just now talked is the visa and things like that, so we make sure that we keep our expenses under control, and we\u2019ll continue to do that for the rest of the year, and so we\u2019ve recomputed all that, and there are a few items here, and that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re not breaking these things out, and we will make the right choices as we go along this year.  If we feel comfortable that we can accelerate growth by recruiting more aggressively, we will do that.", "Mark Zutovich \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Regarding utilization, I think last quarter you had mentioned for the year you expected it to be down roughly 500-600 basis points.  Are you still looking at that target which would put you at around the 68% level, and if so, what quarter do you see a bottom on the utilization front?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We have involuntary attrition that has gone up by 1%.  Our overall attrition is 11.1%.  In fact, for the first time in many quarters, our overall employee count has come down this quarter by 945.  So yes, utilization is going to come down, but to a certain extent it is going to depend on attrition, it\u2019s going to depend on volume growth and things like that.  We need to recruit in certain services.  For example, in BPO, we have to recruit at this point.  There are certain areas where we need to do the recruitment because the business is there, growth is there, so utilization will depend on that.  Secondly, we are also extending training.  We want to make sure that given that there is slack, we train our incoming batch properly.  So utilization will come down.  Is it going to be exactly 68?  Somewhere in that range it will be, maybe even lower than that actually for a brief period.   ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foersi with Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph Foersi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", " ", "We\u2019ve heard some early signs of a movement towards stability.  I was wondering if you could be clear.  Are you seeing this?  It sounds like on the macro side of things, you\u2019re seeing some movement there, and how do we reconcile that versus your cautious tone?", "", "Ashok Vemuri", "Relative to about 6 months ago, we\u2019re definitely seeing a lot more stability, if you will, but there are a lot of contradictions from a macroeconomic perspective.  The data is leading us to believe contradictory things actually, let me put it that way, and some of that is actually getting translated into client behavior as well.  So it is true that we\u2019re seeing some amount of client traction.  Conversations are getting converted into transactions, but at the same time, we\u2019re not seeing any change in the amount of due diligence or the fact that sales cycles are still very long and that decision making is happening at the top of the house.  And also recent data is also creating some amount of hesitations as we see from our clients whether it is increasing delinquencies or the other macroeconomic environment, and we\u2019re continuing to see forced attrition from our clients of their employees.  So a combination of all these things in spite of the fact that we have shown reasonably better number this quarter, we want to be cautious because it is a little difficult to look out and see how this is going to pan out.  We hope it will pan out in the same fashion that it did in the quarter that just preceded us, but we cannot be sure, hence the caution.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "Just to add to that actually, if you look at technology analysts\u2019 predictions, they said that the beginning of the quarter, IT spending will be 3-4% down.  Now actually they\u2019ve revised it to 6-11% down.  So we poll our clients; they have not changed their stance about when they expect recovery happen.  Most of them said beyond March 2010.  That means beyond this fiscal year.  Technology analysts have predicted a downward trend in IT spending.  I saw some financial analysts\u2019 reports also, which said the same thing saying that IT services spending will be muted and most companies will conserve cash and will only look at maybe keeping the lights on, as Shibu says.  We have seen a dip in discretionary spending, and application development has come down.  Our enterprise solutions consulting has come down slightly, so we\u2019ve factored all these things in.  We have several data points, and there are some positive but enough negatives to tell us that we need to be cautious at this point.", "Joseph Foersi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Shibu, you talked about completing pricing and that you\u2019re through phase 1, but that there could be phase 2, if I understand that correctly.  Maybe you could just talk about what phase 1 entails and then what would cause there to be a phse 2, and if there would be further price decreases because it sounds like initially you thought it was 6% down this year, and now you think it\u2019s 5%.", "S. D. Shibulal", "What meant by that is one round of price negotiations are over, and potentially and we\u2019re not saying that\u2019ll happen, but potentially because the clients are saying that they may come back.  If the environment becomes blurred, they may come back.  So potentially there could be other rounds.  That\u2019s the uncertainty in this environment.  There is a little bit of unpredictability in this environment.  At the beginning of the quarter, we said we expect revenue per employee to drop by about 6% this year, but now that we have better information, we have seen one quarter, we have seen the impact, we have changed it to 5%.  So that\u2019s the current projection for the year in terms of revenue per employee.", "Joseph Foersi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "You talked about some key factors, and it sounds like polling your clients is where you\u2019re getting most of your data from, but in your conversations with your clients, what would generally be the correlation that would drive things down low?  Would it be a continuous economic instability or is that just correlated directly to the economy in general?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Clearly the ability of clients to forecast and control their own revenues, that\u2019s what drives it.  It\u2019s all driven from the CEO downward.  If the CEO sees revenue drop by 20%, there is an immediate cut on expenses by 20%.  This is in US of course.  In Europe, the way they handle these things is slightly different.  So, it is CEO down, it is their ability to forecast their revenues, it is the growth or the impact on their own business, so it\u2019s really driven top down, and the IT departments and various business functions react to that actually.  We\u2019ve had clients tell us that in March, April, etc., their ability to forecast was one of the lowest in recent memory.  They had absolutely no way to forecast their revenues.  In May-June, we got the feedback saying that we\u2019re feeling slightly better, but in the last two weeks, as Ashok already talked about, again there is some slight tentativeness again.  So this is the uncertainty we are faced with today, and nobody is able to give the comfort level, and then we read all this economists\u2019 reports and analysts\u2019 reports, etc., and so we felt that we have to be cautious at this point.  If you look across sectors, manufacturing, and retail, clearly they\u2019re going to take much longer to recover.  So there are sectoral differences, there are overall economic impact, and lots of data points, and we have tried to look at all these things and, as I said clearly, the negatives at this point outweigh the positives even though we had a good quarter.  We felt that we cannot change the guidance at this point, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve left it at this point.  Then you start back-calculating from that guidance various other parameters and you get the rest of the numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Khatri \u2013 Cowen & Company.", " ", "Moshe Khatri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "I think BFSI was actually flat for the quarter, and telecom was up I think 1 or 2% for the quarter sequentially.

Basically, BFSI was fairly flat this quarter as compared to the previous quarter.  Of the 27 new accounts that we have opened this quarter, 9 of them are from the BFSI space\u2014equally distributed in the US as well as in Europe.  We are beginning to see some traction in a variety of areas, especially around productivity improvements, efficiencies, projects on agility, etc., that have started and we are in active conversation on post-merger integration work\u2014not as large as we thought we would see, but even then we\u2019re seeing some of those programs start.  We\u2019re seeing a lot of work on consolidation.  We\u2019re seeing a lot of work on elimination of process duplications and replications, a lot of work on agility and process improvements.  Specifically, we\u2019re being invited increasingly to areas where we were not being invited, and I mentioned post-merger integration as one of them.  We\u2019re seeing a lot more traction on some of our platform-based solutions, especially in the payment area.  We\u2019re seeing opportunity in the replacement of legacy transaction systems, especially in core banking.  We\u2019re seeing some opportunities in securities trading and processing, wealth management\u2014an area that\u2019s been a forte of ours\u2014we\u2019ve seen it there.  We\u2019re seeing activity in our risk management and compliance solutions, especially on internal audit, and I also mentioned the post-merger integration and consolidated IT cost reduction opportunities in certain lines of businesses and in certain geographies.  We are also seeing increased traction, if you will, in new geographies which are typically not our areas of strength especially in the Nordic regions where we are seeing some traction, in continental Europe, in Australia, as well as in South Africa.  ", "With regard to pricing, as Shibu had mentioned earlier, we do believe that most of the price renegotiations are behind us, so the flights to procurement that happened at the beginning of the quarter and there was a little bit of an overhang into the quarter as well, that is over, but having said that, we do not eliminate the possibility of a revisit in certain cases to that.  Having said that, our pricing continues to command premium, as we understand from our clients as well as from the industry analysts continues to command maybe a little bit lower, but command a premium over the pricing that our competitors are charging.

Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing also on the telecom side?", "Subhash Dar", "In telecom, we did see a slight increase, although it\u2019s more like flat revenue this time, and basically this is because of revenues coming from certain clients and kind of balancing out some of the fall which may have had in other accounts.  As you know, telecom business is quite lumpy for us in terms of revenue per customer.  The revenue concentration tends to be pretty high, and therefore slowness of decisions even by one of those clients can create some of this unevenness across quarters, so I wouldn\u2019t reach too much into this quarterly number.  I think the overall trend is that the telecom demand has not been seriously impaired in this downturn; however, the main issue has been the slowness of decisions, and that is the main concern for us in telecom.  I didn\u2019t quite catch your last point.  Was that a separate question or was it the same?", "Moshe Khatri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "I just mentioned that the contribution from your largest client, and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a telecom client, declined sequentially during the quarter.", "Subhash Dar", "I agree.", "Moshe Khatri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "You mentioned that the consulting segment lost more than $2 million during the quarter.

Balakrishnan", "Consulting subsidiary is a statutory reporting, and so don\u2019t look at it too much because consulting overall is split between the parent and the subsidiary, and overall consulting is doing well.  It is profitable.  They have actually higher utilization than overall company and doing well actually.  They have a few combined entity, their margins are pretty good.  In the transformation deals that they\u2019re working, their margins are better than company average.  If you just taking consulting alone, their margins would be closer to 68% actually, so overall consulting is doing okay.  China is still incurring a very small loss.  We have now multiple multinational clients.  Most of the clients we are working out China are multinational companies who are entering into China, the number of employees is about 1000, and we\u2019re happy with the progress we are making in China.  Of course, our foray into domestic Chinese market is yet to yield results, but clearly we are in the direction in China, and we are happy with the progress we\u2019re making.

Can you describe what a worst case scenario might look like for Infosys in terms of disruption or costs?", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "It\u2019s very difficult to paint a worst case scenario.  Let me try.  Worst case scenario would have to be that the law comes into place and it is effective immediately.  If it gives some time to companies to meet the targets, let\u2019s say six months a year to meet the target or if it\u2019s only for new visas, etc, the impact is much lower, and it gives us the time to adjust to that.  What we would have to do is recruit additional people and bring back some of the existing people and replace them with people hired locally in the market.  There is a blip cost temporarily because there is an overlap between the two teams, but then when it reaches steady state, offshore would probably increase slightly, onsite will come down.  Onsite teams will be mostly about 50% hired locally, and it will come to steady state after that, so that\u2019s the scenario most likely if it really goes through, but given that that the quota is not through, I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go.  Unemployment is high, so it\u2019s really not clear at this point which way it is going to go, and even before this all happened, we had been recruiting in the US, and we continue to recruit in the US.  This year also we had said that we will be recruiting about 1000 people.  We are adding sales capacity in the US, so we continue to recruit in the US, both at experienced level as well as in colleges, so we continue to recruit, and we\u2019ll have to wait and watch at this point.", "Ashish Thadhani \u2013 Gilford Securities", "", "Based on your analysis of what the temporary interim costs might be, is there any way that you can put a boundary around that or quantify it?", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "No.  We have not attempted to do that.  We may have to recruit maybe about 2000 to 2500 people to meet the numbers or we have to acquire a company.

What is driving that because typically it seems like September had been one of your strongest quarters?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Julio, we are considering this as an extraordinary year.  We never had a year of zero growth, right?  It\u2019s an extraordinary year.  The uncertainty continues to be very high.  I actually just read a Goldman Sachs report where it said that IT services and offshore you\u2019re quite negative actually, so just know I read that report.  We read all these reports, and we are also concerned, so we felt that it is better to be cautious.", "", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "When you look at the margin buildup, I think when we had some numbers last quarter, I think this question is for Bala, we walked through some scenarios in terms of how much of a benefit you would get from rupees.  The rupee was going to benefit you 450 basis points, and then you told us that pricing would be down 250 to 300 basis points and you told us that utilization would a drag of 200 to 250 basis points.  Along with that, you told us that reinvestments in sales and marketing would also be a drag anywhere between 200 to 300 basis points.  The change in your guidance this time around for the operating margin assumption is purely the reinvestments in sales and marketing.  Is that what you are suggesting?", "V. Balakrishnan", "You\u2019re right Julio.  It\u2019s basically the change in the investment because we talked about two investments.  One is onsite hiring, second is sales and marketing, so those things we were not able to spend in the first quarter.  That could get spent in the next three quarters, so to that extent that is some reduction in the spending, and number two, we also reworked the costs, and overall, the savings is around 150 basis points.", "", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Can you just clarify the cross currency benefits?  Historically we had only worried about the rupee and the rupee impact to the margins, but obviously with everything that\u2019s going on now with the pound and the euro, etc., some of those things are working either with you or against you, and I didn\u2019t understand what you were trying to suggest about how much those other currencies either helped to hurt relative to what the rupee was doing in the current quarter.  Can you lay that out a little bit more clearly please?", "", "V. Balakrishnan", "", "Yes.  Life has become tough with cross currencies because earlier we had to worry only about rupee-dollar.  Now there are multiple currencies which are moving up and down.  Most of the European currencies have strengthened against the dollar during the quarter.  When it strengthens, our reported dollar revenues look good and to some extent the benefit flows into our margins, so this quarter we had a 3% appreciation in rupee that could have impacted the margin by around 1.2%, but we had that cross currencies moving in our favor.  It more or less offset the impact.  It\u2019s very difficult to put a number for the cross currencies like the Indian rupee because rupee-dollar, for every 1% move, we can quantify it has a 40 basis point impact.  Cross currencies are difficult because each one moves in different direction.  For example, Australian dollar appreciated by around 15%, UK pound appreciated by around 8%, Euro appreciated by some 5%.  That sort of currencies and the percentage of revenues coming from those currencies also vary, so it is very difficult to put an exact number for the cross currency movement.", "", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So the 3% rupee change would have been a 1.2%.

Balakrishnan", "", "Yes, negative.", "", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "There\u2019s a lot of other noise, so it\u2019s hard to quantify that, so I got that.  Just to be clear on the constant currency assumption, at the beginning of the year, we are thinking a range of constant currency flat to down 4% and you are now seeing constant currency is going to be down 3 to 4%.  Most of that I think you guys have explained as your being cautious, the environment stinks, and we did write a report saying that thing are still pretty bad out there, so I agree with you guys that it probably makes more sense.

Is this the worst, is the worst behind us, or are you guys still assuming that some of these other verticals could stay squishy and I guess related to that, the telecom client that has been decreasing, is it done showing the atrophy or could you guys still see more pressure there?", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "When you look at industry verticals, we believe that manufacturing, retail, etc., would take much longer to recover.  Having said that, there are specific clients who start spending early, and we may see some of that also.  They may in anticipation of recovery start spending, because retail includes CPG also, and we may see some of that.  Then we may see better growth on one of these sectors, but generally we feel that manufacturing and retail would take much longer to recover.  Telecom because they had gone through a downturn in 2001, probably the memory is quite current, seems to handling this better.

Balakrishnan", "We had contemplated meeting these numbers when they had given the guidance originally.  There of course has been small margin improvement by about 1.3% as compared to budget, and this is because of the cross currency movement which has been in our favor, so overall when we had given the guidance this year, we had anticipated that we would be meeting a possibility of approximately 20% on an overall basis, and we are in line with meeting that target.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "I had a question, Bala, with regard to the unbilled revenue.  The unbilled revenue seems to have risen both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue.  Historically, I thought that moved in concert with fixed price contracts, but they actually declined.  I\u2019m just trying to understand why it was that unbilled might have moved up if fixed price moved down.", "V. Balakrishnan", "The way to look at is you have to see the net of unbilled and unearned revenues.  Normally the incremental movement is something around $10 to $20 million.  That is what happened this quarter also.  Especially the unbilled revenue would have gone up slightly because of the currency factor also because the dollar declined against European currencies, so if some of the fixed price contracts are denominated in European currencies, the dollar value of that could look higher this quarter.", "James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Bala, the subtext to some of the questions on this call seem to be that you may have sandbagged the guidance both for this quarter and for what remains for this year.  One question I had was with regard to the onsite-offshore mix because your onsite-offshore mix came down actually about 100 basis points, which I realize it takes a while to spend what you had contemplated in your guidance, but that number in particular seems more mechanical and because of the related visa costs and the profitability profile, that does seem to be potentially an important margin factor.  My question is with regard to onsite-offshore, what are you contemplating now?  Are you moving more people here or there and what is the overall trend for the year in the onsite-offshore mix?", "", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "", "In our guidance, we have assumed the same levels.  When we negotiate with clients and clients want lower costs, etc., one way to give that to them is to bring more work offshore.  Don\u2019t read too much in into a quarterly number, but yes, there is some benefit to clients, some benefit to Infosys if you do more offshore in this environment.  That\u2019s one factor that is driving it, but quarter on quarter, there will be some small variations.  There\u2019s reduced development work now, and discretionary spend is lower.  It\u2019s possible that some of those people have come back, so that\u2019s where it is right now.  It\u2019s not a trend yet, and let\u2019s wait for more data points in the future quarters before I say that we are definitely moving work offshore.  We are also going to recruit onsite, and we have already stated that and hence some of those costs are go back in to the model over the next three quarters, and that\u2019s where we are.

We are working on system integration opportunities related to the mergers and acquisitions in these cases.", "From a service perspective, we have seen better traction in business process management, infrastructure management and in system integration. System integration I believe is as I said is a result of the M&A related work, which we are doing in the financial services.

The volume growth had been 2.3% and offshore volume growth is 3%, that is a very good news. Pricing was stable. It increased by 0.4%, but in terms of constant currency, it declined by 1.1%.", "The gross profit slightly went up during the quarter and so also the operating margin. Operating margin went up to 30.3%. We guided for a $0.51 EPS and we did $0.56. So the DSO days are 56 days, the collection has been extremely good. The quality of the receivables is extremely good. We are ending the quarter with $2.8 billion of cash.", "As far as guidance is concerned, we revised our guidance to reflect the current environment.

Almost all the subsidies have become profitable. They are contributing positively to the bottom line of the group except Brazil which is still in the growth phase and investment phase.", "Our guidance for the next two quarters assumes some 1% sequential growth in revenues at the upper end of the guidance. For the next two quarters, the margins could get impacted because we have given a wage hike. Starting October 1, we increased wages in India by 8%, and outside India by 2%, which will impact the margin by two percentage points. So first two quarters, we have seen incremental positive margins. In the next two quarters, it could get impacted by around 200 basis points. So for the -- overall for the year, we could be within the 50 basis points to 100 basis points band as compared to last year.", "In the beginning of the quarter, we also spoke about some of the investments we are making in terms of hiring more on-site people and also increasing the sales and marketing, that we will continue to do. We have already given some 126 offers for people to join on-site. Of that some 72 people joined during the quarter, rest of them will be joining in the next quarter, and we will continue this process in the future quarters also.", "The incremental growth in revenues and some of the cost initiatives we took have yielded results and that will buffer this investment. So going forward, we will be able to absorb this investment and only incremental impact on the margins could be due to the wage increases which we are giving effective October 1. So overall for the year, the margins could be within a narrow band as compared to last year. It's an extremely very good quarter, and the next two quarters our guidance reflects the environment and what feedback we got from the clients.", "With this, I will conclude. We will open up the forum for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator instructions). Our first question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Khatri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Avishai Kantor \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Yes. Hi. It is Avishai Kantor for Moshe Khatri. Just two, three questions to begin, one can you comment on the major drivers for the strong performance in both BFSI and retail?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "I will start with retail and I will ask my colleague Ashok to talk about some other -- some other positives on the BFSI space, where we are getting growth. So in the retail you know one, we work with some of the largest retailers in the industry, so we have very strong relationship. I think we work with I think seven out of the top ten retailers.", "Second, retailers are going through a couple of very interesting transformations. One is the move from print media to digital media, the digital marketing campaign, digital marketing transformation they are going through.", "Second is digitization of the information flow in the supply-chain, so that they can get near real-time information about sales that is happening in the store, all the way down the supply-chain. The third is actually improvements that are happening in the store to provide better customer service, a better technology-based environment in the store for self service and things like that. So there is investment happening in the retail space even now.", "The third thing is, we work with some of the largest grocery companies, and in the downturn, they have seen actually a positive impact on their business. It looks like consumers are eating less in restaurants, but buying ready-made meals or take home meals or something like that, and that is also positively impacting retailers. And hence they are investing in technology, they are investing in IT systems. We also benefit from some of the consolidations that are happening, which is actually a common theme across many of the industry segments in which we are working.", "Now let me pass it on to my colleague, Ashok Vemuri, who heads banking and capital markets to talk about the BFSI space and where he sees traction.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Thanks, Kris.", "So clearly in Q2, we have had about 3.5% growth in the BFSI sector and with the addition of six new clients in the sector equally distributed between the US and Europe. We are seeing -- the good news is that decision-making is now happening, there is increased traction which is getting converted, is going beyond conversation to actual deals. The bad news is that the decision-making is still happening at the top of the house, and it is a fairly longer decision cycle time.", "So we're seeing interest in clearly in the asset management space, we're seeing it in securities and investment firms. We're seeing a lot of interest in regulatory compliance risk, internal audit. We have made some good strides and progress on work in M&A related deals. Retail banking, I think is reflecting the high unemployment, so that is a little slow. Cards is slow but with some regulatory changes etc., we do expect significant portion of the cards business to come our way.", "Europe is a little I think -- is a couple of \u2013 is lagging behind. I think there is a phase lag there, but again Continental Europe which has not been our stronghold is showing signs of increased willingness to partner with offshore players. We have seen traction in Australia. We have seen traction in Asia, ex-Japan, and some amount of Japanese clients getting active in regions outside of Japan.", "So on the whole, I would say that we are beginning to see some traction, I would still think we are in the woods. so to speak, and we will have to wait to see how the budget etc. pan out before we actually are able to conclude whether we are in a better position than we were previously.", "Avishai Kantor \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thank you. My next question, you had a very nice sequential up tick in clients wins, going from 27 up to 35, can you please breakdown the client wins by verticals, basically BFSI, retail and telecom? And also what was the sequential growth in your largest client this quarter? Thank you.", "Operator", "May we move on to the next question?", "S.D. Shibulal", "The client wins have been in \u2013 Hi, this is Shibulal. The client wins have been across the verticals. As I said, three of them are in Fortune 500. There is no specific vertical where there is a major win, I do not have the sheet in front of me, but I remember seeing a number like seven in BFSI. The remaining is spread evenly.", "Avishai Kantor \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Seven in BFSI?", "S.D. Shibulal", "Seven, yes.", "Avishai Kantor \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Khatri [ph]. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Mark Marostica of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "Good evening. It is Mark Zgutowicz for Mark Marostica. Just a question on your revenue guidance, just a little bit of a disconnect here, your revenue guidance implies you know relatively flat growth in the second half, and obviously you have seen a couple of good volume trends sequentially over the past couple of quarters, just curious is there is something on the horizon that you're seeing that gives you caution there, along those lines can you speak to your expectations for growth in Europe in the second half?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No. Typically the December and March quarters are soft quarters because December is more a holiday season and March because of the first quarter and the client finalizes the budget. Our guidance reflects the environment because clients are still very cautious, even though they are seeing some optimism, but still cautious about the future. And quite possibly we will have much better visibility when they finalize their budgets for next year, that could be somewhere in January time frame. So we had given a sequential growth of 1% at the upper end of the of the guidance for the next two quarters to reflect what the client is telling us about their business environment. And on Europe, I will ask Shibu to talk.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Europe at this point is lagging behind the US on stability which is expected because even on the downturn, Europe's lagged behind US on the downturn, and so that is what we're seeing. And across the board, UK as well as the continental Europe is lagging behind. At the same time, we are quite positive about Europe in the long run. We are investing in different countries in continental Europe. We are investing in Germany, in France. We believe that this will be of -- these markets will be of great importance to us in the future.", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just a couple unrelated questions on headcount, the 2,000 incremental that you have added your guidance there, what percentage of that is lateral, and if you could comment on what your fresher lateral mix is right now?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Well, it is mostly lateral, all of it is lateral for Infosys Technologies, and it will be a fresher and lateral for the BPO, because the combination of the corporate level for everybody, so there'll be two levels, one for Infosys Technologies, the parent company, and for the BPO. The BPO has seen a reduction in headcount or this quarter compared to the previous quarter. INFY has added, INFY does not require any freshers, but requires laterals. Laterals are people of experience of more than two and a half, three years.", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "And your current mix there and sort of maybe trends next year on the lateral hiring side?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No. We don't have a view on lateral hiring for the next year. We only have a view for this year because we don't have the numbers for next year. And for the lateral hiring for the parent company, the hiring will be in specific areas where we have seen growth like infrastructure management services, or where there is very specific skills required as in the enterprise solutions group, and not across the board for all units.", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And your current mix on the fresher lateral side of the equation today?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "What is that?", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "What is your current fresher lateral mix today?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Well, out of 20,000 people that we are going to hire gross today, 15,000 will be freshers and 5,000 will be laterals. Our normal percentage could be 60-40, 60 freshers and 40% laterals. But this year the hiring is less, and the fresher hiring is because of the offers we made last year, not out of necessity, but the need to keep our commitment, so the ratio will be slightly different this year.", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "Okay. That is helpful. And then just one quick final question, on the selling and marketing front, can you just talk about investments that you are making here and whether the levels you're running at now as a percentage of sales are sustainable through the remainder of this year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No. We had given guidance. We said we will hire some 100 people this year. We already hired some people this quarter; next two quarters, we will be hiring balance of them. It will not substantially change as a percentage of revenue because most of the cost is employee costs.", "Mark Zgutowicz -- Piper Jaffray", "Right, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Marostica. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hello. My first question here is on discretionary spending. It looked like volumes were up, have you seen -- but obviously what development looked like it was down, have you seen any pick up in discretionary spending quarter over quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "The volumes were up by 2.3% this quarter, on-site volumes 0.5, offshore volumes 3%, so definitely volumes are up this quarter. We are seeing some discretionary spend happening in retail and BFSI, discretionary projects being sanctioned etc. You know sometimes may be due to the regulatory changes or related to compliance, risk, new risk models in the BFSI space as Ashok talked about. I talked about retail. So there are -- there are discretionary spends happening, maybe not \"discretionary\" but definitely new projects.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "And then it looks like we're seeing some positive indicators, hirings increasing, you are putting [ph] through wages again, pricing stable, at this point, do you guys get the sense from your clients that you may be bottomed prior quarter and now and that things are probably going to improve going forward?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. We will get a better or more confidence in that when we see the next year's IT budgets. See this year, the IT budgets are estimated to be down by about 6% to 8% from last year. Current indications are that IT budgets are going to be flat from the current level to next year which is I think is an improvement because that shows that companies are able to maintain the current level of expense going forward. But they're going to put that money to better use. They're going to look for more efficiencies. They are going to look for more flexibility which means outsourcing and variable cost. So -- and we're seeing discretionary spend going up. So the environment definitely is better today than last quarter and seems to be improving.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And then just one last quick question on budgets since you mentioned it. When do you expect to get visibility on those budgets and do you think again visibility will be better next year you know compared to year just so we can get a general time frame of when you think things will start to come into picture [ph]?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Current indications are that there should not be too much delay in budget finalization. We expect budgets to be finalize in the first quarter, maybe mid-January to mid-February some time frame.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Does the lack of a flush mean that there may be some pent up demand next year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. You know we expect the flush not to happen this year maybe and the monies to be carried forward, added to next year's budget.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri -- William Blair & Company", "Thanks. Hi guys. Just a couple of questions on the pipeline, could you just give us a little color on how the pipe is looking and what the quality and size of deals is that have been added year-to-date this year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, there are two parts -- a two-part answer to this. One is when you look at large deals, I mean these are deals which require investment of six months to eight months of effort and things like that. So here you know to some extent the pipeline is based on the investments we want to make in such deals. So we do do a lot of due diligence, we qualify the deal strictly and typically we pursue about 12 to 15 deals and we have 12 to 15 deals in the pipeline which we are actually working on. And the good news there is we are seeing confidence returning and clients wanting to close deals. We don't yet how fast it is going to be but definitely there is confidence returning on that.", "The second is you know our traditional model of working with clients, working with existing relationships, and as projects close, you know typically they start some other projects so that the capacity can be retained, and the knowledge can be retained within the project and things like that. Again, and our repeat business has been ninety eight point I think eight I think this quarter which is as strong as it has been in recent past, actually very strong repeat business. We have not -- we have not lost any major customer, and one more data point is that our top 10 customers grew 5.8% this quarter, much higher than the company. So all this point to actually better traction at this point.", "Bhavan Suri -- William Blair & Company", "You know a couple of quarters ago you had mentioned that deals may enter the pipeline for say $150 million, but by the time discussions are complete, the deal value was much less. Is that pattern still continuing?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, it is still continuing. That is because the clients are much more sensitive to -- you know sensitive to what size they qualify these things very well. They cut any unnecessary requirement and things like that, so yes. And also sometimes it gets split across multiple suppliers. So there are many reasons why you know when we finally win it is much smaller.", "Bhavan Suri -- William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then just one last quick question on the hiring of sales people and domain experts, it appears that's been tougher than expected, you know you didn't expect -- you didn't spend them the first quarter and margin was better because you didn't hire all the sales experts in domain resources, you know is it tougher to get those, that seems a little odd given the environment, so a little color on that possibly?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, we have always been very selective. First of all, it is difficult to find good people even in this environment, and we have always been very selective. Second, good people are still continuing to work where they are, you know they are not switching, right? And so, it is sometimes difficult. Third, once you make an offer, it takes some time for the person to join, you know it is not that the next day they will come and join. So as Bala said, 123 offers, 70 people joined, the rest are going to join next quarter. So we're making effort, we are finding the right people, trying to find the right people, and bringing them in. We will continue this hiring. It is counterintuitive in some sense but good people are difficult to find even in this environment.", "Bhavan Suri -- William Blair & Company", "Okay. Great, thanks Kris.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Suri. Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good evening. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of the pace of vendor consolidation and you're sort of relative wins and losses in that area.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Ed, out of the nine large deals in the first half about I think three are consolidation deals. We are able to win most of the consolidation, I can't see any one large one we lost actually, some were announced publicly also. Okay, one -- and Shibu tells me, one we lost in the consolidation, but three we won.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Could you talk a little bit about your move here to raise wages? I was under the impression you really didn't need to do that and maybe talk about why you're doing it at this time and do you expect your competitors, particularly the tier 2 to have to follow?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Till now nobody has done as broadly as Infosys has done. You know they have talked about some increase to some people. We are giving an average 8% increase in India and 2% outside India. And the reason for this is that, Ed, you know we have done reasonably well under the circumstances. We have sustained our margins under the circumstances. You know it was challenging but we have sustained our margins.", "And unlike you know developed markets, you know in India, there is growth. GDP growth is around 7%, and is expected to go to 8%, 9%. We have seen signs of increased attrition in BPO already because as the situation improves people start looking for opportunities to switch and things like that. To some extent, we felt that it is the right thing to do to reward our employees because we have done well this quarter. Second, we want to make sure that we are able to retain the good people, so we will choose \u2013 we will use this amount wisely and reward the right people.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Bala, can you talk a little bit about your foreign exchange assumptions, particularly against the rupee dollar, did you take the quarter end number in your guidance, did you take \u2013 it's moved a fair amount in October, have you taken last night's close, can you give us sort of a sense, sort of what numbers you're using and what the impact is to margins in your guidance?", "V. Balakrishnan", "See, normally we take the rupee dollar rate at the end of the quarter to project for the future quarters, but whenever there is a drastic change in the currency environment, we do take the current rates. The rupee ended at 48.11 or so to a dollar by the end of September, but grew to 47 for the next two quarters, that means an appreciation of something around 3%, which will have something around 120 basis point impact of the margin, but is absorbed because we have seen some growth and incrementally we are guiding for a higher number for the full year. We believe that in the short-term rupee could appreciate because a lot of money coming into the country that is putting pressure on the currency, so next two quarters anyway we assumed at 47. So if rupee appreciated substantially from that level, probably it could impact the margin more than what we guided.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Last question, efforts to sort of combat protectionism in the US, particularly as now businesses are starting to pick up, it actually will become a concern. Are your efforts, your approach in line with that of the approach taken by NASSCOM?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. We're completely in sync with NASSCOM. We are participating in all initiatives by NASSCOM. This is definitely an area of concern. We do believe and I talked about as an answer to the previous question that it is challenging to find people with the right skills and things like that even in this environment. So you know we will work with NASSCOM.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Caso. Our next question is from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Just a quick question on pricing, if you could just give a little bit more color, you talked about stability, but is there any way to contrast across verticals and geographies, any disparities, or is it stable across the board?", "S.D. Shibulal", "So it is not across the board. We have seen stability in financial services and their focus is on getting system integration done, especially whenever there has been structural changes and M&A activities. We have seen traction in retail because of our thought leadership predominantly. We work with eight of the top retailers in US and about nine or ten of the top retailers across the world. And we have invested heavily into retail over the years and so we are seeing traction there.", "Energy and utilities is another space where the downturn and impact has been different or minus [ph] or different, we are seeing traction there. In manufacturing, we are not seeing stability, which is expected, because the retail sales has not picked up. And whatever pick up has happened is still you know taking care of the supply inventory overhang. That means that the manufacturing will not pick up and that is what we're seeing in the manufacturing segment. Europe is lagging behind US in being stable. Of course, they were -- I believe they were lagging behind even in the beginning in the downturn, so they're lagging behind on stability also.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "So are you talking about stability in demand or pricing or they are sort of following and tracking together, the pricing with demand?", "S.D. Shibulal", "No. My comments are more related to demand. From a pricing perspective, I think we are stable all around. Most of the pricing renegotiations are behind us. We have not seen a second round of renegotiations. There are some sporadic wants but that is part of normal business. We will see an impact of the pricing renegotiations which we did last two quarters or four quarters, for the next two or three quarters. This quarter we have seen a downturn in revenue productivity of 1.1% in constant currency, so there is still tailwind defect which will show up. We had predicted a downturn of 5% in revenue productivity from the beginning of the year. For the year, we still expect somewhere between 4.5% to 5%.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. Then just back to wage inflation for a second, was this sort of an off cycle wage increase, is this your normal cycle for doing wage increases, or something that prompted you to do it now? And secondarily, do you think that we are sort of at a range of call it mid-to high single digit wage inflation going forward in out years or is it too early to tell?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, every year we give a compensation increase in April, that is our cycle. This year we deferred it because of the challenges in the environment and the slowdown etc. But we told our employees that if situation improves, we would look at a midyear increase. We have seen improvements in the situation and we felt that you know given the environment in India etc. this is appropriate. Regarding next year, we have to wait and see at this point. You know let us say overall situation in the industry increase and there is a mismatch between supply and demand, you know the growth picks up and supply is limited, then definitely compensation would go up in the industry.", "Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Greene. Our next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead of Kaufman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Karl Keirstead -- Kaufman Brothers", "Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I have got a question about Infosys growth rate relative to overall IT budgets. Chris, you mentioned that IT budgets were down about 6% to 8% in fiscal 2010 and it looks like Infosys revenues would be about flat, so in other words you outgrew enterprise IT budgets by about 6% to 8%. I am wondering do think that relationship is likely to hold or to increase next year and the year after? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, offshore growth has always been higher than IT services growth globally. So when you compare offshore industry, you typically look at growth of Indian IT industry. We have been -- we have been around the same number or slightly better, we have been leading the industry. Now this year, NASSCOM has projected a growth of about I think 4% to 5% for the industry for the year, including BPO. So we have to wait and see where we end up at the end of the year.", "Karl Keirstead -- Kaufman Brothers", "But do think it is fair for us to assume that Infosys next year can outgrow overall IT budgets by a similar magnitude, call it 5% to 10%? Is that a reasonable assumption for now?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "I can't predict out next year. All I can say is that Infosys has been on par or better than industry and I will leave it at that.", "Karl Keirstead -- Kaufman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Keirstead. Our next question is from the line of David Grossman of Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman -- Thomas Weisel", "Thanks. I guess the first question I have is on the margins, you know despite multiple headwinds you are reporting exceptionally high levels of profitability the last three quarters, even after normalizing for currency. So I guess you know the first question I have is really what underlies this trend? I know you have guided down the second half of the year to reflect you know hiring and the decision to put in the annual wage increase but you know can you perhaps give us some insight into how we should think of the margins in a more normalized environment relative to your historical levels of profitability?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No, we have been saying all along that we have multiple levers on the cost side, that is utilization or revenue productivity or the scale benefits we get on SG&A are the mix of business. We use some of the levers at some point of time to make sure the margins are not impacted and we also focus much more on the cost side during the year. Because the environment was bad, we have to make sure that we put the monies in the right areas for us to incrementally grow faster.", "So the revenue growth comes in, that itself is a big buffer for the margins. So we use all these levers at some point of time to make sure the margins are not impacted. Having said that, the currency is one issue, which is external to us. We don't know how it is going to behave, that could have an incremental impact on the margins, and also the tax rate. Otherwise, I think on the operating level side, we have managed it well, and we believe that we have enough levers on the cost side to make sure the impact is minimized.", "David Grossman -- Thomas Weisel", "Right. You have done a great job of managing the margins you know during this period. But I guess I'm thinking when you go into a more normalized growth mode you know should we expect the margins to come down perhaps to the levels that we saw you know back in the 2007 and 2008 timeframe when you were growing at more normalized rates, again currency aside?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, David, you know we have you know two aspirations. One highest margin in the industry, in our industry; and two, we want to limit it, and our limit is because we said it should be highest, we said we should be around a net income of about 26% or 27%. So in a normal environment, we do start investing in multiple new initiatives, so then what happens is investment dollars increase, investment in sales and marketing increases, band building increases, etc.", "Currently the environment is such that you know we need to pull back some of those investments. We are being very selective as Bala said. Now we pick and choose. The choice is very, very important to make the right investments in this environment. So we are still investing in a few, but much less than what we would do in a normal environment.", "David Grossman -- Thomas Weisel", "I see, thank you. And just one other thing. You know I heard what you're saying about you know the hiring and the wages and some of the rationale for that, but it is hard not to read that as a fairly kind of bullish sign despite your cautious outlook. So I guess my question is, are you know kind of taking some of these actions in response to I guess the strength, your confidence, and the visibility in the pipeline? Or are you just looking at you know kind of risk reward in terms of you know what the actual cost versus the benefit of building a bench in India right now at this point in the cycle?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So it reflects the confidence in the strength of the model. It reflects our relationship with our customers and our ability to sustain those relationships. Third, even in this environment, you know there are requirements for specific roles and skills etc., so we have to continue to recruit. And lastly, yes, if we find an opportunity to build up a certain segment or sector in anticipation of some growth coming in, you know we would make those investments.", "So for example we are starting government sector now, public sector. We're investing in India at this point because we believe that is important for the future. So we will continue to make investments in certain sectors for creating future engines of growth. One more point I would like to add, we also honored all the offers we made in campuses and things like that, and that is the bulk of the recruitment this year. We enhanced the training from four months to six months but we feel you know you have seen utilization starting to pick up, so when things improve we will improve utilization, utilize these people, and then start recruitment again.", "David Grossman -- Thomas Weisel", "I see. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Grossman. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry -- Global Equities Research", "Thank you, and good execution. I have two quick questions. First is regarding consolidation, excluding M&A and deals [ph] consolidation, what are you seeing? Like which systems are getting consolidated, what applications are getting consolidated, and where are they moving from? Like what were they doing before and what are they doing now? And then I have a follow-up question.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know it's a very detailed low-level question actually, which technology to which technology. Seem it is really, you know broadly you can say that when M&A happens, you know you have two systems now. You have to decide and consolidate one system. And this is applicable to financial systems, it is applicable to HR, it is applicable to other platforms they have. So it is actually very, very -- you know very, very -- it is typically standard practice in M&A and things like that. It is not about people moving from one technology to another technology, that is also happening. But this is -- when we talked about consolidation, it is about M&A related integration activities.", "Trip Chowdhry -- Global Equities Research", "Okay, thanks. The other question I had is regarding the capabilities of the world, have you seen any shift or changes in the business environment, like the world before recession, during recession, and say post recession that you think Infosys will need to adjust the capabilities because there may be some underlying shift, maybe in technology, procurement, anything you're seeing, because definitely the world is not the same before recession and during recession and history tells that post position may be very different also. So what are you seeing in that space? And thanks, that's all.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. It never is the same thing, right. It doesn't go back to the same situation afterwards. I will just give you, you know, because that is a rather philosophical statement, but let me be very specific. See, in this downturn, we saw an increased acceptance for pay-as-you-go model where the customer wants true variability, they want to actually work with you on and operational expense model rather than a CapEx model, and we have seen traction. We have provided those kinds of services to our clients, we have for example two clients in HR outsourcing, which is priced per employee rather than based on effort and things like that. So that may be a trend which is going to be sustained beyond this downturn and may see a pickup of pay-as-you-go, this is also you know based on the trend of cloud computing and things like that.", "Trip Chowdhry -- Global Equities Research", "Very good, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Chowdhry. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes, guys. I just wanted to understand, in your guidance for the next couple of quarters, are you assuming the current demand environment continues at its same pace? In other words, your commentary today says clients are more optimistic and discretionary spending has improved, are you assuming those precise trends remain in place, or does your guidance leave room or some buffer in place in case those trends start to falter again?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Can you just repeat it quickly, you know briefly can you just repeat the question?", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes. I'm just trying to understand if your guidance assumes the current demand trends remain in place at the same pace or if you are including buffer in your guidance in case the macro trends go the other way?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No. The environment continues to be challenging. This quarter we saw a sequential growth of 2.8% but we have assumed only 1% growth in the next two quarters at the upper end. So clearly, we are not going overboard at this point. We're being cautious. And it is based on a model we have, based on visibility we have. It is based on our reading of the situation. Typically, the first quarter of the calendar year, budgets get finalized. You know it is better to get visibility into that and then say, yes, things have really improved. So we want to be cautious at this point. I wouldn't call it buffer etc., I would just say we want to be cautious.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "All right. And then just a real quick question on the tax rate side, when you started the year, you had a certain plan in place to increase hiring onshore, and I presume that that affected your tax rate mix and your overall tax rate outlook. Given how your onshore costs ramp up has played out, is there any material changes to your tax rate outlook for this year and also into next year based on how the onshore costs are playing out at this point?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No. The changes in the tax, the effective tax rate is based on India rather than outside India. It is based -- because outside India the mix actually matter and you know the revenue mix has not changed that much offshore versus onsite. In India, we have some you know tax incentive schemes etc., some of our units have come out of that and effective tax rate have gone up because of that. That is all. So it is about India.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "So what tax rate change should we look at for the next few quarters and also for fiscal 2011?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Right now, effective tax rate is about 20 --", "V. Balakrishnan", "Right now the effective tax rate is somewhere around 20%, 21%. That will remain so for the full year. It could change next year depending on how much we \u2013 work we do in SEZs and STPs. Hopefully, it could be somewhere around 25%. So this year it could be somewhere between 20% and 21%.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Bourgeois. Our next question is from the line of Mr. George Price of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Thanks very much. A couple questions, first, just wanted to make sure I understood the 8% wage increase, does this include any impact from promotions or is the 8% a fully like for like number?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Everything is included. This is the average including everything.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So I guess\u2026", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "For offshore 8%, onsite 2%.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Right. So can you I guess do you have any sense of if you took away the upward bias to your wage base from promotions that you are just looking at, what raises you know at a \u2013 for people staying at the same level, what would the increased rate be roughly?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, the number of promotions would not be very large compared to the base actually. The base, today we have effectively about 85,000 employees would be eligible for some kind of raise actually, the parent. And promotions, because of some re -- you know we looked at some of the roles and things like that, so we have done some analysis, and you know effectively you know the impact of the promotions maybe for about a small percentage of the people at this point.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So not -- it doesn't sound like much of an impact, that 8%?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No, it is not. So that is why the impact of promotions is very small.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And you say that you know when somebody previously asked a question around the wage increase and you mentioned, you said something along the lines of given the environment you know in India, you thought this was appropriate. So should we think about you know given the macro growth that in India relative to you know the more developed economies, you know where most of your revenue comes from though, should we basically think about wages having a much quicker and more sizable up tick early in the cycle, you know more quickly I guess getting back to the kinds of increases that we saw you know in the last up cycle?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "No, I don't think so. I don't believe so. You know we have to wait actually you know. We see that across the industry, growth is picking up, and see right now there is actually sufficient supply. You know we felt it is the right thing to do for our own employees, because they worked very hard in delivering this result. So we have to look at what the industry does, what our competitors do etc. and what the situation is next year before we can say. At this point, I don't know.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. You mentioned the up tick in energy and utilities, what kind of work is going on there? You know you talked a little bit obviously about what is happening in BFSI but can you talk about kind of some of the key areas where you are seeing strength in terms of types of spending, types of projects in energy and utilities?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "SAP implementation, one large chunk; we are doing some interesting work on sustainability in the area of smart grids and things like that, you know I think it is not (inaudible) but something to do with gas meters and things like that. So some very interesting work in energy utilities, of course, there's some traditional maintenance kind of work also, maintenance and sustenance kind of work.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Last question\u2026", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We have a broad range of services today, infrastructure management is growing as an interesting service for utility companies, SAP related work, and then some innovation related work in sustainability, climate changes etc.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Last question, just -- and there was a question before around margins and you know normalized margin ranges when you get back to more normalized growth range, you know I want to kind of piggyback on that. I just noticed since fiscal 2004, sales and marketing, if I pull that out as a percentage of revenue, if you kind of look at it on a trailing four quarter basis to smooth out any you know one quarter movement, on a trailing four quarter basis, sales and marketing since fiscal 2004 has declined from about the mid 7% range to now under 5% for the first time. And since fiscal 2Q08, the absolute dollar spend on sales and marketing has actually been flat to down. I mean what do you think about that trend, how should we think about that trend and the implications going forward?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, sales and marketing is not proportionate to revenues. It is based on the number of customers, etc. Please see that repeat business is growing. Our customer size is growing, that is you know the number of larger relationships is growing, etc. So it does not grow proportionate to revenue, it grows proportionate to probably the relationships. So one of the things we date in this downturn is that we try to rationalize our customers. You know about 100 customers give 87% of our revenues, 100 customers give about 87% of revenues. So we did some -- we didn't discontinue any relationships but we kind of brought in more efficiency in our sales and things like that and that did help us with some cost control.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, thank you, everyone. Unfortunately, we are completely out of time. Wonderful questions, and as always, your support has been tremendous, the participation has been very good. Our investor relationship managers are all known to you, so if you have further questions, want to talk to anyone of us, you know, please put in your request, and we will connect back with you.", "So thank you again, and have a wonderful day.", "Operator", "Thank you gentlemen of the management. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys Technologies Limited, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us on Chorus Call Conferencing Service and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

As a reminder, for the duration of this presentation, all participants' lines will be in a listen-only mode, and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today\u2019s opening remarks. (Operator instructions).", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys Technologies Limited. Thank you, and over to you, Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks Saji. Good morning everyone, and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys\u2019 financial results for the quarter ended December 31st, 2009. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this earnings call from Mysore is CEO and MD, Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan along with other members of the senior management.", "We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter and year ending March 31st, 2010. Subsequently, we will open up the call for Q&A.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks Sandeep, and good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone of you. Thanks for participating on this call. This was an excellent quarter, we had all-round good performance. The strategies we adopted in focusing on clients, meeting their requirements in terms of cost control, solutions to increasing offshore clearly helped us in this quarter to increase our revenue from our top, our largest clients. This has helped us to grow this quarter by 6.7% sequentially. In constant currency terms, this is about 5.8%. Volumes increased, we were able to hold on to pricing. Our pricing went up on blended terms by 1.1%, utilization improved.", "We added employees, we gave a compensation increase this quarter. So, every one of the parameters we have done extremely well. If you just look at the top 10 clients, you know, top 10 clients grew 12.2% this quarter compared with the overall growth for the company at 6.7%, almost doubling. So, our focus on relationship building, our focus on engagement level investment, our focus on solutions, the differentiations, all these things actually came together and helped us. Further recoveries happened in US in Financial Services sector, we were able to take advantage of that during this quarter.", "Going forward, we believe that given that the budgets have not yet been finalized, we don\u2019t have sufficient data to forecast other than what we have done right now. We have guided for a very small increase in Q4, about 1%, and we expect the margins to be hit slightly because of increased hiring as well as the impact of Rupee. Other than that, the numbers are all with you.", "I will hand it over to Mr. Shibulal to give you more details on the numbers, and then followed by V. Balakrishnan, the CFO on further discussion on the financials.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Thank you Kris. Good morning everyone. As Kris said, this has been an excellent quarter. We have seen all-around improvement and revenue has grown, volumes have gone up by 6.1% sequentially quarter-on-quarter. Pricing has increased by 0.2% in constant currency terms.", "I will now try and give you some color on other aspects. Pricing has gone up 1.1% in Q3. That means we have seen second quarter of sequential stability in pricing. The pricing environment have stabilized. We are not seeing pricing (inaudible). We are seeing a few of them which is normal to our business, normal business, but we are not seeing unusual activity in the pricing side. The recovery is led by US in Financial Services sector. We have done \u2013 we have had multiple conversations with our clients.", "Almost 50% of our clients have finalized their budgets, and for most part, on an average, budget for 2010 seems to be flat. So, we are expecting a flat budget for 2010. While the consumers have started taking decisions and we are seeing velocity of decision-making go up, our customers continue to be cautious about the business environment, about their business environment in 2010.", "Now, geographically, US was gone to 64.9%, Europe has dipped to 21.9%, and from a service perspective, the largest growth has been in business application maintenance, which has gone to 24.5% from 22.7%. Verticals, financial, banking and insurance, Financial Services have shown strong growth. Another vertical which has seen growth is energy and utilities. From an employee perspective, we have added 8,700 people gross, 4,400 people net. Attrition on an LTM basis is 11.6%. Attrition excluding involuntary separation is 8.2% for the quarter.", "Our hiring numbers for the year has gone to 24,000 from 20,000. In Q4, we will be adding 6,000 people. We are also in the campus, doing campus recruitment. Our plan is to give 15,000 offers. So far, we have given 8,000 offers. Our top clients have grown 12.2%, almost double the company average and the remaining clients, the non-top ten has grown 4.8%. So, this quarter growth has been led by the top 10 clients. Number of client additions for the quarter, 32. Our million-dollar clients have now gone to 336, previous quarter it was 330. We have 22 clients contributing more than $50 million on an LTM basis. Out of the 32 clients we have, five are Fortune 500 clients. Number of clients in the Fortune 500 space is 119.", "This quarter, we gave a wage increase to our people, 8% offshore and 2% on-site. Another important milestone this quarter has been the McCamish acquisition which was done by the BPO. And from that acquisition, we have gained $1.9 million in revenue in Q3, and we are planning our guidance for Q4 includes $7 million [ph] of revenue.", "Another major event this quarter was the announcement of flip, our platform for apps, for the small and medium telecom service providers.", "With that, let me hand it over to Bala for financial highlights.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning everyone. We have done extremely well this quarter. The revenues came much higher than what we guided. We ended up this quarter with $1.232 billion of revenues, which was 6.7% growth. Most of the growth came from top 10 clients that grew by 12.2%. Non-top 10 grew by 4.8%. Overall, we obtained a growth of 6.7%. In the beginning of the year, when we guided for the full year, we said revenues could decline somewhere between 3% to 7%. We are guiding for an increase of 1.8% to 2%. In constant currency, it\u2019s still a growth of 1.6% to 1.8%.", "The operating margin have slightly gone up, it has gone up from 30.3% last quarter to 31.1% this quarter. We had an impact because of the currency. The average rate of Rupee/Dollar last quarter was 48.39, this quarter it is 46.62. So, there was an appreciation of 3.7%, which impacted the margin by 1.8%, ;pricing increased by 1.1% in reported dollars. In terms of constant currency, it is 0.2%. Most of the pricing have shown down to margins. Utilization has gone up by 1% that had impacted positively the margin by around 0.6, and we had an intangible write-off, which negatively impacted the margin by 0.3%, and we have reduction in other costs, which contributed profitably by 1.6. So, net-net, we have seen increase in operating margins during the quarter.", "The effective tax rate went up to 22.6% for the quarter. But for the nine months, it\u2019s still 21.2%. This year, it could be somewhere between 21% to 21.5%. Next year, when some of the stock keeping units [ph] get out of holidays, probably the effective tax rate could go up to maybe 25%.", "We had seen all-round growth, it\u2019s not related to one individual customer. Most of the growth came from Financial Services vertical, and we have seen across-the-board growth from all of the customers. We increased guidance for manpower addition, increasing it from 20,000 we guided earlier to 24,000, and we are going to give some 15,000 campus offers for people to join next year.", "So, overall, we have seen a very good quarter, all-round growth, and now, I will open the floor for questions and answers. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our first question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Hi, thanks. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. Bala, utilization rates went up pretty significantly during the quarter, I think about 300 to 400 basis points sequentially. Can you talk about utilization rate targets, I would say for the next six to 12 months, that\u2019s number one? Number two, your stability to sustain operating margin during the next six to 12 months as well, thanks.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Sure, I will answer the first one, the utilization rate and then Bala will answer the second one. See, we generally cannot have a utilization rate target, right, because we honored all the offers we gave to our employees last time. So, they have all come into the system. 8,000 people are still in training. We have expanded our training from four months to six months. So, we have used this opportunity to build talent, and you know, some of the numbers you are seeing this quarter, last quarter is a result of that buildup, because we are utilizing that talent to generate revenue right now. So, utilization in a way is a reflection of the demand. We are quite comfortable having a utilization rate between 76% to 80%. As the demand picks up, the utilization generally goes up. They have been quarters in the past where we have reached up to 82%, but that is not a good point to be in, because that will create tremendous pressure on the staff in new programs. So, our comfort level is between 76% to 80%.", "V. Balakrishnan", "On the operating margin, Moshe, we have given the guidance for the next quarter. Next quarter, the operating margins could decline, one, because of currency, because average rate of currency this quarter was 46.62. We are against 45.75 for next quarter. That could have an impact of close to 100 basis points on the margin, and we are also adding more people. We have increased the guidance from 20,000 to 24,000, that could impact the margin by around 60 to 70 basis points. But for the full year, we will still be slightly higher than what we declared last year. For the next year, we will talk about that in April.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay, then a final question, looking at the pipeline and some of the activity that kind of picked up, you know, what\u2019s the timeline do you think for, you know, that will take for Infosys to go back to a more normalized growth level, let\u2019s say in the mid-teen to high-teen levels going forward?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Moshe, again, we have to wait till April for us to give you the guidance for the next year. What I can say is that things are looking better this quarter. NASSCOM projects that the offshore IT services industry would be having double-digit growth. Their own projection is that somewhere between 12% to 20%, and of course, Infosys tries to leverage its relationship with the clients and try to grow as much as better than the industry. I would leave it to that and just wait till April for that guidance for the next year.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi guys. I wonder if you could talk about, if there was any specific projects or any kind of project flush in the quarter that maybe is a one-time issue or that will take place going forward.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Rather than budget flush, what we saw was a confidence returning to clients, decisions being made faster, you know, because they are seeing a better future, they are starting to spend. We worked very hard in building and rebuilding relationships with our clients. We met their expectations, their requirements in terms of costs and things like that by increasing our fixed price engagement. We built solutions which will give them, you know, softer time to market, better value. So, we did many things right. And that helped us to actually grow. If you look at top 10 clients, it grew at 12.2%. So, that clearly is an indication that, you know, our relationships are one that is helping clearly not the budget flush that is helping us in this regard, you know, the relationship that we focus on concentrated, that\u2019s what is helping. Similarly if you look at service side revenue, maintenance revenue has gone up. So, we make sure that we listen to our customers and meet their expectations.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "So, you would expect this competence to continue someway this [ph] quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, we will get a better view on this once the budgets are finalized by the end of January, first week of February. Current indications are that, even though budgets are going to be flat, offshore spending would increase. Majority of our clients are indicating that (inaudible) would go up. They are deciding today. Previously even though, that was logical decision, decisions were not being made. Now, they are ready to take decisions, and that\u2019s the difference now and six months back.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "As you guys start to talk about sort of your own budget for next year, maybe you could just give us your views on what the margin sustainability profile looks like or it could be in wage increases probably creeping back up?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "For next year, you know, we believe that if this year is any indication, our ability to sustain margin is very, very high. Actual numbers, we will give you in April, but we have demonstrated that we are able to sustain margins even in very difficult conditions, very difficult situations. In terms of some other indicator, we are quite positive. In Q4, we are going to hire 6,000 people. For the year, we are hiring 25,000 people. For next year, we are making 15,000 campus offers, 8,000 already made. So, those are some indicators of our confidence in the current environment.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "And just one last one, if you could point to one reason why you think your margins have been more sustainable and maybe address it in reference to, maybe you are sacrificing some growth, if you could just talk about those two factors?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "See, rather than us looking at it as sacrificing growth, what we see it is as disciplined growth. The key is to maintain a certain discipline in your place and things like that, you know. Ultimately, if you undercut, what happens is when things improve, both the factors won\u2019t be sustainable. And somebody will always be lower than you, and that is a no-win situation, so you just party, and the clients lose ultimately because we can\u2019t serve the clients. We lose because we find that it\u2019s not a sustainable business. So, what we have done is this relation to customers, so we have increased the fixed price, we have tried to meet their expectations on cost, we have definitely met their expectations on value. It\u2019s a disciplined approach to fail. That is what we are focused on, that\u2019s what we are trying to do. And we are happy that when growth came back, the clients spend their money with Infosys, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s reflected in this quarter\u2019s numbers.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Thank you and very good execution. I have two questions. First one is regarding Windows 7 and its upgrade. Are you seeing any increased business activity that has helped your business because of the launch of Windows 7? And I then have another question.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know, unfortunately I don\u2019t have any data on Windows 7 adoption. Definitely we have a service around Windows 7 migration as we had for Vista, as we had for other Microsoft products and things, but we are a large partner for Microsoft. So, we have a service around Windows 7 migration, I don\u2019t have any data on the adoption at this point.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "The second question I have was regarding the app store you have created for your mobile operators. So, two questions, is this app store available for global telcos or in option telcos, and second is, there are three or four platforms which are \u2013?", "Operator", "I am sorry. Mr. Chowdhry, could you mute your line when you are asking a question. There seems to be some disturbance on the call.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Okay, can you hear me better?", "Operator", "Yes, are you using your handset now?", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Hello? Can you hear me?", "Operator", "Yes, please go ahead.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, go on, yes.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Yes, the second question I had was regarding mobile. The app store you have, is it for the global scale or is it only for pre-operators, and the sub question I had further is, there are about two or three operators, I mean, the platform which are popular these days, BlackBerry, Android, maybe iPhone, which platform app are you creating these mobile app stores for? Thanks.", "Subhash Dhar", "Hi, this is Subhash Dhar. I will take that question. The flip platform is a third-party white-labeled application store platform available for operators everywhere in the world. We have kicked it off with our first client, Aircel in India, but we are in negotiations with other operators as well, both in India and overseas. As regard to how does it compare to the platforms you just mentioned, the platforms you have mentioned are largely device-centric app stores, whereas this one is designed to be more operative-centric app store. That is one difference, and the second is that this is a third party running it. So, the developers who contribute their applications to the application store, they do not have to go and tell this to every device or every operator. Once they come on this store, they can be distributed to theoretically all the operators who sign up and theoretically to all the devices that are supported by the operators. So, that difference we believe, which is a superior model of creating an ecosystem of our apps and connecting the consumers or the ultimate users to the app developers.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Very good, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Hi guys. Just a couple of quick questions here. You know, you said that 50% of clients have finalized budgets (inaudible) clients. So, I am little surprised by kind of the muted guidance for the next quarter, given that 50% of clients have finalized budgets, any sort of commentary on that?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Our guidance is based on the data we have, and given that only, you know, some of the clients have finalized their budget, there is some uncertainty. Second, there is an uncertainty about the sustainability of the recovery, there are again few reports would say over 40% clients that the recovery can actually backtrack. So, given that we have limited data, given that we need probably more causes of growth before we can confidently say that normalcy has returned, we adjourn this guidance, and yes, this is a cautious guidance, and that\u2019s where it is.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, and then one quick question on sort of the new model, can you give us a little color on the traction you are gaining with new models, for the call, you know, last quarter, roughly 5% of revenue was coming from the new transaction type of models, the non-linear pricing. How has that grown this quarter, and then also just on, how are you funding CapEx, or how should we think about CapEx funding for these new models, should require investment in hardware, software, R&D so on so forth.", "Subhash Dhar", "Okay, this is Subhash Dhar again to take that question. We are tracking around that same percentage at this point in time. We have \u2013 that number has almost doubled in terms of contribution to our revenue stream in last fiscal year, so we are really encouraged by the profits we have made in the new engagement models and the non-linear price deals. On how are we funding the CapEx part of it, we are being selective in what platforms we are building those, that we would see latent demand from our clients and from prospects. We are also looking at those which have higher leverage where as relatively low capital investment gives us larger sized deals of our deal mandates. So, we are being selective. I think that\u2019s how we are controlling. So, there is no limit to how many platforms one can build and imagine, it\u2019s almost every engagement into a non-linear model. So, we do pick and choose those platforms that have been hiccups in CapEx, the capital expenditure investments and for the OpEx model to the clients.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Thanks Subhash. I guess longer term though, as the model shifts to, you know, a greater portion coming from these platforms, the CapEx model for Infosys has come after shift from sort of the CapEx per FTE per person to more investment into assets, you know, it may be volatile [ph] assets, how should we think about that transition in CapEx?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know, we are also partnering. So, for example, when there is a hosting required, we may actually partner with somebody who can provide that hosting and we will come up with a revenue share back-to-back revenue share with that company. On the software licenses also, we have back-to-back agreement, the revenue share agreements etcetera. So, we are also looking at how can we balance the CapEx with our capacity to investment in things. Capacity, of course, exists but we are also looking at it in a smarter way.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, thanks. Good quarter guys.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Suri. Our next question is from the line of George Price of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thanks very much, nice quarter. Just wanted to see, I know IT budgets are, you know, they still haven\u2019t been totally finalized, although it sounds like flat to up modestly depending on who you talk to. But are you or would you be still fairly confident that offshore growth would be, you know, at least making the low-double digits when you look at just the offshore portion?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, that is the indication we are getting currently. You know, everyone of the discussions we have indicated that their allocation to offshore should increase. We looked at industry analyst report, we looked at NASSCOM itself, which is the National Association of Software and Services Companies in India. They also say that the offshore IT services industry should actually growth of somewhere between 12% to 28% [ph]. So, some of the data points indicate that offshore allocations should increase.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. In terms of M&A, I know you have commented on this a lot, it\u2019s a typical question, but specifically, what types of services would you be most focused on? And I guess, the recent uptick in M&A in the industry, particularly over here, but I think just in general, does that make you feel that you have to little quicker, does it change at all, how you think about your M&A strategy?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We have done an acquisition this quarter, a small acquisition, McCamish Systems. It is a platform serving insurance industry. They manage life insurance policies and things. So, it\u2019s a platform that you will just feel about. So, the reason why I talked about it is that, that gives you an indication of our strategies on acquisitions. We look at the strategic side, we look at the ability to leverage that acquisition, show their ability to integrate that, retain the employees. The company must feel that their joining with Infosys is going to enhance their ability to serve their clients. So, there are various things we look for, and the bottom line is strategic fit, ability to retain employees and at the right size. So, those are the things we look for. We don\u2019t want to be so stingy on acquisitions, but definitely it is not how we look at acquisitions. We don\u2019t have goals like, you know, one acquisition per quarter and things like that, we don\u2019t have any such goals. If we find the right company, then you will see Infosys doing an acquisition.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Last question is, just beyond M&A which would be an obvious use, you have a lot of cash you continue to add to it, what are you going to do with it? Thank you.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "I am going to ask our CFO, Bala to talk about it.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Right now, we are keeping it in the bank, and make sure that exists. We will look at opportunities as Kris said, if we find a good opportunity on the way, we can use some of it. And if you don\u2019t find a use, we always return to shareholders. We have done it two or three times in the past. So, we will wait and watch for some time, a lot of things happening in the environment. If a good opportunity comes, we can do something.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Price. Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes guys. Is there any reason to expect that sequential growth as in the December quarter may not repeat itself in the upcoming March quarter? I mean, do you see any particular obstacles other than the absence of finalized budget data from your clients?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Without data, you know, I cannot say anything, right. That\u2019s exactly the decision we are in, and with the data we have, we have given you the guidance. No, since you better \u2013 what numbers would end up, you know, we don\u2019t know at this point. We have given you what we know. Also, what this quarter has demonstrated is that the company is well prepared to take advantage of accelerated growth. We have the bench, we have the capacity, we have the right services, we have the relationships. So, if let\u2019s say, there is acceleration or opportunities are there, then we can take advantages coming from it.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Got it. You have increased your hiring plan by about 4,000 people. Is that new hiring plan reflecting a revenue trajectory that might be a little bit better than what you have given in terms of guidance to the Street?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We believe in strategic events, we believe in capacity. So, if the opportunity comes, then we can take advantage of that and grow faster. Whatever we see in revenue, we have given you as guidance.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "And then in the hiring plan where you have increased it by 4,000 people, should we assume that some of these added hires will not start work until fiscal 2011, or will a meaningful portion of those new hires potentially start during the March quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "I will request Mohandas Pai to talk about how the hired people get billed in what timeframe in which they get billed, what is the training schedule, etcetera. So, he will talk about when will they become billable, when they get billed etcetera.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Thanks.", "Mohandas Pai", "The freshers \u2013 can you hear me?", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes.", "Mohandas Pai", "The freshers will take about ordinarily 29 weeks to get billed, because they seem at the end of six months, they do have flexibility to put them into delivery for billing after about 20-and-a-half weeks. As far as laterals are concerned, they can get billed within 30 days from the date of joining, in case we do have the work. The additional people that we are hiring this quarter consists of a substantial number of freshers who are joining us and are part of the earlier commitment that we made. So, they cannot be billed this quarter. Two, of the laterals that we are going to hire, a fair number could be expected to come in the last 45 days of year. So, a fair number could not be billed. So, what will be billed this quarter will be the freshers who have been released from training, and the part of the laterals who have been hired and come onboard in the month of December. And we have increased the number from 20,000 to 24,000 to take care of any growth requirements for the next year, because the freshers coming next year from the colleges will be ready to be billed only at the earliest by November or December. And that\u2019s why we need to have in advance some people in the system to take care of our needs.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Great. And then, one other question on headcount mix issue, will we be expecting in fiscal \u201911 that your mix of onshore staff that\u2019s not working on a Visa to go up meaningfully, I know that\u2019s been something you kind of been working on in the last year, and should we expect further, I guess, call it progress in that regard in increasing your onshore staffing mix of non-Visa workers?", "Mohandas Pai", "Yes. We are still going ahead with a move to hire 1,000 [ph] people. We got about approximately 150 to 160 people in the system, and so next year-end, we should have more people where local residents of the countries where we work in the entire system compared to where we are today.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Bourgeois. Our next question is from the line of David Grossman of Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Hi, thanks. Just go back to the quarter, I mean, you highlighted the growth of the top 10 being 2x the sequential growth for the base of the business, for the average for the business, can you help us better understand, you know, is this reflecting some of the price concessions that we talked about earlier, I guess in the year where we are talking about price concessions that exchange for higher volumes, or is this really just a straight kind of improvement in the overall environment and increase in economic activity among some of the other things you talked about?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, David, there is a combination of both, where we had to meet the expectations with our clients, when we have tried to meet them in a disciplined way as I said. We have tried to fix price. Our fixed price have gone up. In some cases, we have reduced the rates, but by and large, we have created a win-win scenario for our clients. We have met their expectations and things like that. There is also an improvement in decision-making, clients are confident about the recovery, and they are now starting to spend. And that is also reflected in the growth.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "And in terms of the pricing, I think this is, if I am not mistaken, maybe last quarter you had flattish sequential growth in constant currency and pricing, is there anything structural or given the visibility you have that we would see any reversal in the trend in pricing in that we saw in the current quarter?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Pricing will be flat, stable, we don\u2019t believe we can increase the pricing in this environment. What we are trying to do is trying to play with the business mix rather than pricing, and that can give us some improvement in revenue per employee.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "I see. And then just lastly, I think, Rod just asked about the hiring plan and so the mix, you know, onsite, and I think we have talked about this in the past, and when we last spoke, I think you were a little bit behind plan. I was just curious, you know, you caught up to your current year target at least to where you wanted to be at this point in the year and if not, maybe you can help us better understand what some of the challenges may be that you have been facing in terms of ramping your non-Visa headcount locally?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We are slightly behind, the reasons are many. One, it is difficult to find the right set of skill sets and things like that. Second, we have to cast our net far and wide, so it takes more time. It also \u2013 some of the good people actually require time to join, they don\u2019t join immediately, sometimes as much as six months actually. So, even though we have made offers, they have not yet joined this company. There are various reasons why we are slightly behind in the numbers. But we are focused on increasing this number as Mohan said, we want to recruit more people at our prime locations.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "So, just last, I guess is on the tax rate, there is little of current thinking in terms of the tax holiday, you know, is there a chance we can see another extension or does it feel like, well, we have kind of played that out and we should just pretty much assume we are going to see the FTTIs [ph] go out and that will come in and you know, just play out pretty much as it kind of next year.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "As of now, we don\u2019t see the tax holiday being extended, maybe if on a few \u2013 maybe right. A buck [ph], maybe there will be some hope, but right now there is no hope of extension in the tax holiday.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Grossman. Our next question is from the line of Mark Marostica of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. Just have two questions, wanted clarification, could you just clarify how much you, and now the industry expects offshore is going to be up this year, and then my second question, of your IT budgets that have been finalized, how many of those clients do you expect will spend linearly throughout the year, and how much will be a bit more tentative in spend in line with economic trends? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You see, we have given you the guidance for Q4. We will give you the guidance for next fiscal year in April, and our fiscal year starts from April 1st, and next fiscal year in April. That is the reason why I gave you industry data rather than Infosys data. We don\u2019t break up the budget visibility we have, we did give you some indication on what, you know, is the competitive commentary on the budgets. So, we believe that majority of the budget should be finalized by January end, February first week. We believe that the budgets are going to be flat in most cases. We believe that our listing in about 50% of the cases where we have had discussions, they have indicated that the offshore part of the allocation would increase. So, those are some of the data points I can share with you at this point.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Then maybe just sort of qualitatively kind of high level speaking, I mean, if you look at your client base, is there any constraints you have in terms of the pace of that spend or is your backlog strong enough over the, you know, if you look over the next six months, you know, six to 12 months that you are not really concerned about the case of the spend of those IT budgets?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Definitely we are in a better position. I know that is indicated by the growth in Q3. There is confidence within clients and they are spending the money. So, decision-making is happening, let\u2019s say, like normal times or near normal times.", "Mark Marostica \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks very much, appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Marostica. Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good morning and good evening. I had a question on, you are particularly strong in applications and maintenance this quarter, and I am wondering what you were seeing on the other side on sort of the new initiatives that are more discretionary spend-driven, especially given the comment about around improved velocity of positions?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Well, on discretionary spend, the environment is that we won four transformational deals last quarter. That is an indication of, you know, normal decision-making. So, we believe that discretionary spend transformational projects would see further traction.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "On pricing, I know it\u2019s up a little bit, but with the big step up in applications management which is generally lower margin work, how are within the particular service offerings, how are pricing, I mean, where if you sort of forgot about the mix shift, what was the trend in pricing?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Frankly, it\u2019s stable or flat. Most of the renegotiations are behind, of course, there will be some periodic renegotiations which are based on annual calendar and things, so that happens every year. But the renegotiations which are tied to the downturn seem to be behind at this point. And that\u2019s where we expect pricing to be stable and flat.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Last question, if you can update us on the subsidiaries and how they came in relative to your expectations?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Well, most of the subsidiaries are profitable now, except for the new ones like Mexico and Sweden. If you take consulting for example, they are profitable. They made a net margin of 4% this quarter. China is profitable, you know, it\u2019s always profitable. So, they started contributing positively to the group\u2019s profit.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And how was that relative to what you are expecting?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Well, that\u2019s our expectation, because we expect all the subsidiaries to deliver on the margins and most of them are doing it now. Of course, the new ones have to start deliver, that will take some time.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Caso. (Operator instructions) Our next question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Mr. Katri, your line is being unmated, if you have a question, please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Yes, thanks. Just a follow-up, can you talk a bit about Europe? North America, obviously drove a significant portion of the upside in terms of accelerating revenues on a sequential basis, Europe seems to be trailing, maybe talk a bit about the timeline here, when could we expect Europe to kind of pick up, maybe also talk about the UK, which I think account for pretty significant portion of your revenue base in Europe? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Hello?", "Operator", "Yes, please go ahead, sir.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "This quarter, we have seen Europe sequentially grow by 0.9%. While these are early indicators, we expect Europe to always pick up with the lag, and our belief is it will be between three months to six months time period where we will see Europe picking up, assuming the overall economy across US and Europe will remain stable and there are no new surprises. We are already seeing some traction in terms of dialog across sectors both in UK as well as in the Continental Europe. And this quarter, we saw Continental Europe sequentially grow by 5%. So, that\u2019s again an indication of the things to come.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And also, telecom remains kind of muted, can we talk about the outlook for the telecom vertical and some of the activity that we are seeing there?", "Subhash Dhar", "Yes, this is Subhash. The demand for the telecom-related services are picking up, thanks to the investment in, the opportune investment in the networks that we have seen across the globe from major incumbent service providers. However, we believe there will be a lag between the network investments and the system, and we hope that should be a couple of quarters, and sort of to come from a strong demand for us. But we did see some of that in the last quarter and that got reflected in the growth that the segments have demonstrated. The other reason why there is going to be a bigger spend in the networks is because of the proliferation of the devices and applications, which are potentially choking the networks. So, that\u2019s a good problem for the service providers except that they need to now get into the capital expenditure mode. So, that\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s probably only based on services that we are offering in this market.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "And then a final question for Bala. Bala, what\u2019s your outlook for (inaudible) next year and six to 12 months outlook for the Rupee and obviously that\u2019s going to be probably one of the bigger challenges to deal with down the road? Thanks.", "V. Balakrishnan", "I hope I know that, Moshe. It\u2019s very difficult, because the currency could appreciate in the short term. Lot of money coming into the country, but it will also follow a global event. The Dollar carry trade is a big thing across the globe. So, it is volatile, that\u2019s why we have taken a short-term view on covering for next two quarters, we are not going beyond that.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Katri. Ladies and gentlemen, participants who have questions, please press star and one at this time. If you wish to ask a question, please press star and one now. We have a follow-up question from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Hi guys, just a quick question, I know we are wrapping up the call, but given the 8% wage increase in October, have you given any thought to what competition increases in April might look like?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "For April, we have not decided as yet, but we are going to examine it. We are going to see how the growth in the near term is and what we can afford. In the third quarter, we have paid 100% variable to all our staff, and on average, it could vary depending upon your performance, we are paying 100% this quarter. So, we will take a decision possibly later in this quarter, we have not decided as yet. But we are open to looking at the \u2013 at this point of time based upon the information we have.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "I guess should we expect a wage hike in April as you traditionally do?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "I don\u2019t want to comment on that, because we have not taken a decision, because every quarter, we all sit down and look at how the economic environment is and then take a decision. You know, in the first quarter, after the first quarter results, we looked at rate. Second quarter results, we looked at into target, but in third quarter, we are going to pay, and this quarter, we have given 100% available payment. So, end of this quarter, we sit down and look at it and take a decision. Right now, I mean, I don\u2019t want to hurry out a guess.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then, any upside on the traction in the government sector? I know you hired the CEO for the government business unit you established in the US, and it\u2019s early days, but any sense of how that\u2019s tracking and what sort of deals you are pursuing there?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "We have not yet hired. You know, that hire did not work out. So, we are still looking for that, for the CEO [ph] that position.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "And any traction in that or you are just holding off until you hire a head in the business unit?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, in the US, we will hold off till we get the CEO, but in India, we have significant touch in the government sector.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Suri. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks again for joining us in this day and we look forward to talking to you again in fourth [ph] quarter. I would like to hand it over back to the management for any closing comments.", "Operator", "Gentlemen, from the management, would you like to add any closing comments? Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys Technologies Limited, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us on the Chorus Call Conferencing Service and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

As a reminder, all participants' lines will be in a listen-only mode for the duration of this presentation. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today\u2019s opening remarks. (Operator instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys Technologies Limited. Thank you, and over to you, Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks Hershelle. Good morning everyone, and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys\u2019 financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31st, 2010. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this earnings call from Bangalore is our management team.", "We will start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter ending June 2010 and year ending March 2011. Subsequently, we will open up the call for Q&A.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything which we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. S. D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good morning everyone. This is Shibulal. I am waiting for Kris and Bala who will be joining us shortly. In the meanwhile, I will give you an overview, and I am hoping that before the Q&A starts, both Kris and Bala will be here to give their remarks. This has been an excellent quarter for us. We have exceeded the higher end of our guidance. Our guidance for the quarter was $1.24 billion to $1.25 billion. In constant currency terms, it is $1.231 billion to $1.241 billion.", "Revenue for the quarter is $1.296 billion. So, we have exceeded the upper end of the guidance. Revenue increased sequentially by 5.2%, and in constant currency terms, it increased by 6.1%. The volume increase also is 5.2% sequentially. The offshore volume increased by 5.3%. Pricing has declined during this quarter, 1.5% blended; utilization has gone up, of course because the demand has picked up. So, what we are seeing in the market is that most of our clients have closed their budgets. Their budgets are flat or marginally up. At the same time, majority of our clients are clear that their spend in offshore will go up through the year.", "We are seeing increased velocity in decision making. We are seeing the start of discretionary spend. Our clients, their business priorities continue to in two areas. One is fulfilling the demands for their clients, second is to manage costs. To align with that, the IT departments are also focused on investments, which are relevant for the future of our clients, at the same time, managing costs.", "On the margin front, during the quarter, the margin has decreased by 100 basis points as per IFRS. The last quarter margin, that is the Q3 margin was 31.1%, Q4 is 30.1%. Effective tax rate has come down in Q4 to 21.6% versus 22.6% in Q3. On the employee side, we have added 9,300 people this quarter as against a planned addition of 6,000 that was the original plan. The net addition is close to 4,000 people. For the year, we started out the year by a plan of adding 18,000 people for the year. We have added 27,000 people as of right now.", "During the guidance, we have said that we will be adding 30,000 people next year. Our EPS including exceptional items was $0.61 for this quarter. This is as against the guidance of $0.56. If you exclude the exceptional items, the Q4 EPS was $0.59, which is better than the guidance which we gave. The pricing environment as I said remains stable. We are not seeing too many pricing renegotiations. There are sporadic renegotiations which are going on, but that we consider as part of our regular business.", "As far as the business environment goes, the global economic environment remains challenging. There are still fundamentals, which are yet to correct. Unemployment rate and other issues are being on the minds of our clients, but the business is \u2013 the clients, our clients are starting to invest in their growth and looking at ways to emerge stronger when the downturn is over. And we are seeing that in terms of discretionary spend. Our revenue from the transformational space, which is consulting, enterprise solutions, system integration has gone up this quarter from 23% last quarter to 26% this quarter.", "As I mentioned, as far as the budgets are concerned, most of the budgets are closed, flat or marginally up. Offshore outsourcing continues to be a strong theme in the budgets. Q4 was an excellent quarter for us as far as client additions are concerned. We have added 47 new clients. This is roughly the highest over the last many quarters. Our Top 25 clients grew by 7.5%, and the remaining clients grew by 3.4%. Number of million-dollar clients have gone up to 338, 26 clients give us more than $50 million in the LTM basis right now.", "So, overall, the performance has been very good. We started out the year by giving a guidance of negative 2.5% to 3% growth. We have completed the year with a growth of 3% positive. Given the year, given the situation, we believe, this is an excellent performance. Today, we have about 126 Fortune 500 clients. So, with that, actually Kris is here, and with that now, let me hand it over to Kris to add additional remarks and probably I can come back to give you a color on the operational highlights.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks Shibu, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone. I feel sorry, I am a little late, you know, one of those days where we are rushing from one meeting to another meeting, or one interview to another interview.", "Overall, when you look at the year, I think the bottom line is we have emerged stronger out of this downturn, growth is back. Our customers, our clients are trusting Infosys to help them build a better future for their organizations, they are investing into the relationship, they are growing with Infosys. We have been able to continue to recruit, we have been able to continue to build capacity and capability, new solutions, new IT and things like that. We have managed to, you know, go through a year where the Rupee appreciation is almost 6% and still we have been able to sustain our margins. In fact, our margins have improved by about, operating margins improved by about 90 basis points from the beginning of the year, and without sacrificing the future, without sacrificing growth.", "So, clearly, we have shown that the model is resilient, the model is a strong model for the future, for the company. We began the year with about 3% to 7% decline in revenues and we ended with 3% increase in revenues. And growth actually helps manage the business better, manage the growth better, manage margins better, and we have again proved that this year also.", "Our guidance is for 16% to 18% growth for next year. Because of the appreciation of Rupee, because of compensation increase etcetera, we are looking at EPS growth of 5.3% to 9.6%, excluding the extraordinary items. And we have again demonstrated that we have the capacity to grow, we have the bench to grow, if opportunity presents, we can grab that and grow faster. So, we will continue to focus on building the capacity, building the capability, building the resilience, building the solutions, the services, the relationships, the employee base, and we will be able to sustain what has made this company successful till now.", "Now, let me hand it over to Shibu to continue his discussion on the details on the numbers.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you Kris. Just to give you a color on the numbers, our consulting and package implementation revenue went up this quarter. This is a reflection of the discretionary spend from our clients. 23.3% last quarter versus 26% in this quarter. We are also seeing good traction in the infrastructure management space and the system integration space.", "As a percentage of revenue, application development and maintenance has come down this quarter. Fixed price is marginally up. Europe up from last quarter by about 0.6%. This is in line with our investment, we are investing in Continental Europe. The growth in Europe is mostly in the Continent. We have now two country heads in Europe, one for France and one for Germany. We are hoping that our investments in the Continental Europe will further allow us to expand and grow our business in Europe.", "Almost all verticals have shown good growth other than telecom. Telecom as a percentage has come down, and this is more related to a single client rather than an industry-wide phenomenon. If I remove that one client, the rest of the clients have grown this quarter. As I mentioned, our revenue productivity has decreased this quarter by 1.5% and for the year by 4%. This is a tailwind effect of the pricing renegotiations we did over the last 18 months.", "For the guidance purposes, we have assumed revenue productivity to be flat or the pricing to be flat for the coming year. Total number of employees is 113,000. Our utilization is in a healthy area, 77%. We are quite comfortable with high-70s, low-80s.", "So, I have covered most of it. Now, let me hand it over to Bala for the financial highlights.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning everybody. This quarter has been an extremely good quarter. We are done $1,296 million of revenues, which is 5.2% growth. In constant currency, more than 6% growth. Volumes grew by 5.2%, pricing came down by 1.5% on a blended basis. In constant currency terms, pricing came down by 0.7%. So, if you take the full year, the volume grew by 6.7% and pricing declined by 4%. If you remember, in the beginning of the year, we said that revenues could decline somewhere between 3% to 7%, we actually grown the revenues by 3%. We said that pricing could decline by around 5%, the actual decline is only 4%.", "We also said the operating margin could decline by 300 basis points, but when we completed the year, the operating margin actually went up by 100 basis points. In the current quarter, the currency momentum has been drastic. We have seen around 1.5% appreciation in the Rupee, which impacted the margin by close to 1%. That is an impact on operating margin we see in the current quarter. We had some exceptional revenue this quarter. We sold our investment in OnMobile Systems, Inc. We liquidated around 60% of our holdings, because as a financial investment, we felt it\u2019s the right time to encash that investment. We have balance 40%, which we will encash whenever the liquidity opportunity emerges.", "On a tax front, our effective tax rate is 21% for the full year. In the current quarter, we have two significant impact on the tax front. One is the reversal of provision we made for the (inaudible) because the clarification has come in the current budget before the Parliament. So, we reversed around $69 million, which pertains to previous year. And we also set up the deferred tax liability for the branch office, which we have outside India in our overseas branches, because we believe there is the branch profit liability, which could get triggered, and we have set up a deferred tax liability of $52 million. Net-net, the effective tax rate for the full year is around 21%. We have given a guidance of $0.56 on EPS, we have done $0.61.", "Excluding the income from OnMobile, the sale of investments, it is $0.59, similar to what we have seen in the last quarter. For the next year, we are giving a guidance of 16% to 18% growth in dollar terms, around 5.3% to 9.6% growth in earnings per share, excluding the one-time investment gain we got in fiscal 2010. So, we are assuming the pricing to remain stable, so we have not assumed any change in pricing for next year. We are assuming an addition of 30,000 employees next year. We announced a wage hike effective April 1st. On an average, offshore wages could go up by around 14%, onsite by around 2% to 3%. It will have an impact on the margins in the first quarter, but over the year, when more people join, the pyramid effect will make sure the impact of wages is minimized on the margins.", "We assumed a Rupee/Dollar rate of 44.50 for the next full year, which means, and Rupee appreciation of around 6.2%, because average Rupee/Dollar rate in fiscal 2010 is 47.43. So, the currency will have an impact of around 250 basis points on the margins. We will have the wage increases, which could impact the margins by around 3%. Of course, the utilization could go up, and then we have the other levers on the cost side. So, net-net, the operating margin for next year could decline around 1.5%, that is factored in the guidance. The impact would be more in the first quarter than the full impact of wage increase is felt on the margins, but for the full year, the decline is only 150 basis points. We are ending the year with $3.5 billion of cash. Our accounts receivable is 59 days. It is one of the best in the industry. We have hardly 4% of our account receivables more than 60 days. So, net-net, we have done well this year. This is one of the toughest year, because the economic environment was against us, currency volatility was very high, and in spite of all the starts, we delivered good numbers, we held on to our margins, and we believe next year, given a realistic guidance based on what we see in the market at this point of time and hopefully the growth comes better than what we expected, then we will have more leverage on the margin front.", "Thank you. Now, I can open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And our first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. Mr. Foresi, your line has been unmated, if you have a question, please go ahead now. We have \u2013", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Can we move to the next one?", "Operator", "Sure, we will move on to the next question. The next question is from the line of Mr. Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mr. Bourgeois, your line has been unmated. Please go ahead with your question. Sir, may we move on to the next question? There seems to be no response from this line either.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Ed Caso. Please go ahead. I apologize, the next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Hi, thanks, nice quarter. Bala, can you talk a bit more in details about the delta between revenue growth guidance and EPS growth guidance, maybe go through some of the various moving parts that will be impacting EBIT margins in fiscal year 2011 and maybe kind of quantify the impact for that, you know, per factor? Thanks.", "V. Balakrishnan", "So, basically, we are talking about revenue growth of 16% to 18%, and EPS growth of 5.3% to 9.6%. This is excluding the one-time gain of $11 million we have seen in fiscal 2010, because of our sale of investments, it\u2019s a one-time event. We are assuming that the margins could decline next year on year-on-year basis by around 150 basis points. One, because we are assuming currency at 44.50, that means Rupee appreciation of 6%, which will have an impact on the margins by around 250 basis points. We have announced wage increases effective April 1st of 14% average in offshore and 2% to 3% onsite, which could impact the margin by around 300 basis points, but over the year, since we are adding 30,000 employees, and most of them will come in the bottom of the pyramid, the pyramid structure will make sure the impact of the wages is not 300 basis points, it will be much, much lesser. And we also assume that the utilization could go up by 2% next year, because we have enough people, all the people who would join the company will be in training, not many will become productive. So, that could positively impact our margins by 100 basis points, and we will have the scale benefits and other cost initiatives, which will come and buffer the margin to make sure the overall impact on the margin is only 150 basis points for next year.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "All right. So, you have enough leverage here to offset, to potentially offset the evolve of currency, but then if revenue growth comes out a bit stronger than expected, you know, the margin compression probably even, you know, becomes a bit more minor, am I correct?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, you are right. If you look at, for example, fiscal 2010, when we started the year, we said revenues could decline by 3% to 7%, and the margins could decline by 300 basis points, but when we ended the year, we had seen revenues growing by 3%, and the margins growing by 100 basis points. So, it\u2019s all in the growth. At the end of the day, growth is the biggest lever we have. If the growth comes better than what we expect, that will help us to minimize some of this impact and make sure the margins are maintained.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And then a final question, looking at some of the revenue metrics, you had a pretty significant pickup in package implementation, SI, the more discretionary stuff during the quarter, is that trend, is that based on what you are seeing out there in terms of maybe your pipeline and the conversion rates, should we assume this is a sustainable trend for fiscal year 2011, and then maybe this is also a question for Kris, do you think where you are headed towards a multiyear growth cycle similar to the one experienced by many of the offshore companies from \u201903 to \u201907? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, what I mentioned was that, you know, if you look at our aspiration, our aspiration is to increase our revenues from transformation projects. What we call transformation projects are those projects which are business-oriented, which is changing the clients\u2019 business, which is sponsored by the clients\u2019 business where they are willing to give a reference saying that we were part of changing, say fundamentally changing their business processes. Now, those projects usually come through when there is discretionary spend, and today, clients are focusing on building their tomorrow\u2019s enterprise. They are thinking that, you know, when this downturn is over, you know, how do you handle, how do you build the enterprise which will last for the 21st century. And our transformation projects are focused on those areas.", "Now, you will always have two kinds of revenues. The transformational revenues is transactional in nature, that means they are not annuity-based, they don\u2019t last for the next 20 years. But at the same time, so we need to balance that kind of revenue with the annuity revenue or the long-term revenues. In that space, when you look at the long term of annuity revenue space, we have large deals, large wins. For example, this quarter, we have five different wins, five wins in the large deals space by SGS, our Strategic Global Sourcing group. Two of them are more than $150 million of size.", "We have growth in the infrastructure management space, we have growth in the independent validation space. Our engineering service, we are hoping that we will grow faster next year. So, after all, at the end of the day, it is a portfolio which we need to manage. Our guidance reflects our viewpoint or our consolidate viewpoint, right. The guidance is the reflection of our consolidated viewpoint.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Moshe, Kris here. Your question about, you know, are we looking at 2003 to 2007, not yet. I strongly believe that, you know the global economy is not completely out of the woods yet, and, you know, we don\u2019t have a bubble economy back, you know, in 2003 to 2007, it was probably a bubble. So, we are not back there. What we are seeing is that even though businesses are cautious, they are investing into building the future as Shibu said. You know, there is only so much you can get out of cost cutting. You have to think about your future, you have to invest in technology, you have to invest in new products, new markets etcetera, and all of that, all of those investments will require technology change and that\u2019s where growth is coming for us right now.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of George Price of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thanks very much. Wondered if just I wanted to ask one question about Europe, can you talk about where demand is stronger in Europe and maybe in the context of both the UK and the Continent, and specifically in types of services? For example, if demand is stronger on the Continent in, you know, the more discretionary areas like applications development and systems integration due to restrictions around outsourcing?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Hello?", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hello?", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B. G. Srinivas. With respect to Europe, again there are two parts to it. In the last quarter, we have seen growth coming both from UK and also growth coming from the Continent. The sectors, which have contributed to the growth include manufacturing, to some degree banking and capital markets, primarily coming from the UK, energy utilities, and retail and CPG. These are the sectors which have contributed to growth. Going forward, as I see it, there is a fair degree of stabilization in the client environment, both in Continent and in UK across sectors.", "The budgets have been finalized, and the IT investment decisions are being taken. Still however, we foresee a delay in the way the large outsourcing programs would happen. So, there will be more short-term projects in the near term, but the traction is across sectors and also the traction has been across the Continent, including Germany, France, Switzerland, and in the UK.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Just unclear on that larger portions, it is more on the short-term project side?", "B. G. Srinivas", "We are not seeing any difference in the onshore onsite mix or offshore onsite mix with respect to the programs delivered for our clients in Europe. However, in the Continent, it is in some programs, you will require the local capability and to that extent, there is a percentage of local mix in the onsite component, the ratios however remain unaffected.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, okay. Second question, sales and marketing, you know, I think we have talked about the fact that sales and marketing spend for instance has been as a percentage of revenue has been declining over the past several years, and as you come out of the downturn, I am just wondering, is the nature of the demand that you are seeing and the deals that you are seeing, is that supportive of an overall lower sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue or do you think, you know, for some reason, this component will need to ramp back up as a percentage of revenue, so you can capture more of the growth?", "Subhash Dhar", "Hi, this is Subhash Dhar. I will take that question. I think one of the things about sales and marketing expenses going down as a percentage of revenues is probably not so bad, I think it shows some scale benefits that we get as we grow. Having said that, I think there is also various kinds of models floating around in the industry on what you call sales and marketing. We have pure sales and then there is a whole bunch of sales support activities in the company, which we don\u2019t actually classify under sales costs, because they are also part of the delivery capabilities. So, you know, but really to talk about your point on correlation between the percentage of sales and marketing costs to the deal flow, given that our sales model is largely relationship-oriented or relationship-based and that reflects in the repeat business that we get from our clients, most of the selling actually happens at the time of delivery of the project, where we get extensions to the projects, where we get the next project because we did the upstream work very well and so on.", "So, this is a very different model, this is not a products kind of a model where you go and secure every project independent of what you may have done in the past. So, I don\u2019t know if we have answered your question but there are couple of those points. One is that it\u2019s a relationship-based model and second, there is a whole bunch of sales support activities that we don\u2019t really account for in our sales costs.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, fair enough. Last question if I could, could you talk a little bit more about or talk a little bit about maybe Infosys consulting and where you stand on your efforts in moving up the value chain in consulting services particularly as you are accentuating the rise in the mix of more transformational types of work, where does that business stand and have you had made any changes to, you know, kind of the organizational structure of the Infosys consulting in the product company? Thanks.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Hi, this is Ashok Vemuri. Let me try and take that question and the parts I heard. You know, our journey on the transformational services on providing business transformation product line is actually progressing fairly robustly. Our consulting business is actually doing pretty well in terms of both the spread that they have, the kind of deals that they are doing. Most of these deals are being done in conjunction with our vertical and horizontal units, and we have seen the traction in the market for transformational deals actually going up, both in our large units like manufacturing or BFSI or in other smaller ones.", "This is both across the US as well as Europe, we are seeing a good traction, we are seeing, you know, we actually at this point of time, doing a lot more of the strategic work, which will translate into technology work for us as we progress these transactions.", "George Price \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Price. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi guys. My question here is, we returned, a couple of different questions, but we returned to a sort of a normal budgeting cycle, and should we think of this as more of a, you know, maybe 2000, back to 2000 when the budgets get set, and you know, in the past we had seen sort of the budgets be set and you guys exceed that from your original guidance. I am just wondering how we should think about sort of the budgeting process?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, I think the good news this time is that unlike last year, the budgets did come on time. The process was much more streamlined, very similar to the years in the past. Clearly, the commentary that accompany the budget did indicate to us that the budgets have been locked in, but the disbursements if you will, against those budgets will happen in a short cycle manner. That does indicate to us that even though there may be dollars available, they will continue to be a little bit of caution as the expense in terms of expending those particular dollars. The other thing that\u2019s actually interesting from a BFSI perspective specifically and I have addressed that part as well is that we have seen more of the budgets actually being handed over to the business people, so it\u2019s on the core strategic transformational type of transactions are being led from a technology dollar spend also with the business people.", "So, I think that\u2019s an interesting thing that we are seeing. But overall, on an average, I would say that the budgets that we are looking at from a quantum perspective have typically been flat to slightly positive.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "And you talked about a shorter cycle, what would cause the cycles to return to sort of a normal level? If the market stays stable, does that elongate the spending cycle?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, that is one, and the second one is based on the tenure of the transactions that they are engaging with, right now, coming out of the recession, they are still in terms of the tenure, short in the six to nine months timeframe, but increasingly, we are seeing the tenure of the transactions of the programs extend to a year, in some cases, two years.", "And I think whenever there is a value-added strategic transformational deal which is separate from a commodity or run-of-the-mill technology program, we see that they are willing to take on slightly longer tenures, but obviously these transactions are much more complex and the contractual agreements that go with that are also much more sophisticated and complex. So, I guess with the passage of time, as we see a lot more of these transactions come up, there is a little more confidence in wanting to make the spend, decisions get finalized as to what and where the spends will happen, we will see a return back to some of these commitments as it were in the budget expand to more than a short term. So, hopefully medium to long term.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "It looks like maybe wage increases came in a little bit higher than what people were expecting. I wonder if you could talk about what you think about sort of a labor market at this particular point in time, what your expectations are for attrition rates maybe going forward, and any thoughts on wage increases that you are seeing out there in the market from some of your competitors?", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "Well, I am Mohan. I would look at this as an inflection point for the labor market here offshore, because so far, industry was delivery-driven in the sense that most companies had to build up capacity, the business used to come, the market was growing. From now on, the market is going to be sales-driven, solutions-driven, where you have to go and prove your worth and compete more aggressively, and deliver greater business value. It means that you have to re-architect your entire labor force and come out with a career architecture process, which meets the new needs, and we have exactly done that with the last 18 months and transformed all this. So, our career architecture which was rolled out in October means that we will build deeper domain and technology competence.", "We will honor people and reward them for being more competent in the domain area rather than having people management skill becoming project managers, we need project managers of course. And that means their ability to go up the ladder and become people managers, will become slower. But at the same time, we have to have a compensation structure, which reflects the value that they add and pay them much better, so they don\u2019t look for a promotion every two or three years just to get a compensation hike, and we have done that in this first quarter by coming out with a compensation plan, which pays an average of 14% in a range of 13% to 17% for up to 54,000 of our people, so that this layer which is the technology layer will see better payment as stick on longer. For the senior people, project managers being 10% because we are at market, and we believe having paid this, we will create a layer of people who will look at getting greater business value, we will make poaching from us much more expensive for the rest of the industry, and we will set new benchmarks, and we will make sure that we transform ourselves.", "If you set the cat among the pigeons for the competition, because they have to come with organized structure and accelerate the trend towards greater concentration of industry in certain areas. So, when the bottom layer of the pillar, bottom layer of the pyramid gets commoditized because people compete on price, you will be right there in the middle and competing for the top. So, we will vacate space at the bottom, because rates may not be worthy for the next two or three years and deliver greater value.", "Part of a master strategy, what about, will it reduce attrition? Yes, we believe it will reduce attrition, starting not this quarter, the next quarter, because this quarter people leave for higher studies. Will it set off rates for higher competence in industry, possibly. It means that people who can afford to do things better and have better sales will possibly pay better and I will give us an unfair advantage. What work, compensation hike for next year, too premature to say what will happen, we have to wait and see. But certainly among all companies, with this comp hike, we are very well placed.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "So, just to be clear, it sounds like you are paying better than industry rates but they are associated with performance, is that correct?", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "I didn\u2019t catch the question. What is that?", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "It sounds like you are paying better than industry rates, but they are associated with performance, is that correct?", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "Absolutely, absolutely. Performance has become more sharply defined. For example, we had the first layer with about 38% to 40%, now it maybe 25%. So, that higher performance will get paid more, but the challenge in this industry is correlating high performance to billing rates and that has not happened We have to come out in the next one or two years to correlate higher payment and higher performance to higher billing rates, and that correlation is something that needs to be addressed for the industry to become more competitive, to become more of a consulting industry where compensation depend upon your billing. We are working on a strategy for that.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Hi guys. I wanted to enquire about the demand outlook over the next year and what\u2019s in your plan? So, your revenue growth guidance is 16% to 18% and assumingly that\u2019s above what most investors were expecting your initial guidance to look like. So, as you set this guidance, can you give us an idea what you are assuming about the discretionary IT services demand environment, particularly in the back half of your fiscal year. You clearly saw an uptick in discretionary services demand in the recent quarter, and I am wondering if you are assuming that, that rebound continues over the course of the fiscal year, or if you are assuming more conservatively that, that moves more sideways from here?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, if you look at last two quarters, you know, we have grown 6.7% in Q3, 5.2% in Q4, and we have guided for about 3.2% growth in Q1 of this fiscal and 16% to 18% for the year. Discretionary spend is back. This quarter we have won four transformational projects, two of them more than $50 million. We have won five large deals, you know, $50 million plus, two of those deals are $150 million plus. So, our guidance is based on our polling of our customers, the data we have about their budgets, how much they are going to spend with offshore providers like Infosys. So, it\u2019s based on data we have, the model we have created over the years, and the information we have about, you know, how this is going to pan out and things like that. So, that\u2019s what it is based on. And definitely, we believe that the discretionary spending will continue this year.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Are you assuming it gets better as the year progresses or that it stays roughly at the level that it was when you ended the March quarter when you look at discretionary demand?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, it depends. You know, right now, we believe that it will become better, confidence will continue to improve, and businesses are starting to do better. So, clearly we believe that it will improve over the year. Now, having said that, you know, the global economy is still not out of the woods and there are concerns about Europe, some countries in the Europe, the concerns about unemployment etcetera. So, it\u2019s a cautious optimism at this point.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, and when you say you believe it will get better, which I think all of the evidence which suggests that it probably will at this point, are you assuming that it will get better in the guidance that you set, or are you leaving some, call it some buffer in your guidance in the back half of the year in case things move more sideways instead of up?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "You know, we have a model for giving guidance and we have followed that model. We have used the data we have and given the guidance. You know, if we look at the guidance this year versus last year, we are in a better place today. We have better visibility, we have had two good quarters. We have our clients confirming that they are going to increase offshore. So, our guidance is based on that. So, last year, we said minus 3% to minus 7% decline, or 3% to 7% decline, this year we are saying 16% to 18%. So, we are in a better position than we were 12 months back and that\u2019s reflected in the guidance. Is there a buffer etcetera, it\u2019s model. We have a model and we use that model and that model has not changed.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, got it. And then one related question, when you look at the improvement in growth that you have achieved in your systems integration and package implementations segment in particular, can you dimension how much of that improved growth is coming from the market rebounding versus share gains that may be accelerating for you at this point, is it mostly the market rebound that\u2019s helping the growth, or are you seeing more pronounced share gains in recent history there?", "Chandra Shekar Kakal", "Yes, Kakal here, Chandra Shekar Kakal. If you look at, or if you go back 12 months ago when the downturn started, most of the discretionary spending was held back and the focus was on doing the maintenance support on better in the package implementation space, but that has changed in the last two quarters. So, we have consecutively seen in the last two quarters that easing out uncertainties have eased out, and stability has returned in some sense. It\u2019s a mix of both. If you say market rebounding and clients starting to spend, starting to invest in the business, not just focusing on cutting costs but starting to focus on investing in the business for the future, and also you had gain of the market share from others. So, we have had both in the last quarter to increase our revenue from package implementation and consulting.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Is your win rate improving in the systems integration and package implementation space or is the win rates based relatively constant in the last couple of quarters?", "Chandra Shekar Kakal", "In the last couple of quarters, our win rates also have increased, pipeline has become better. Previous to the last two quarters, the pipeline itself was not so good, because the clients were not spending and there were holding back and the programs really \u2013 were not really taking off. All that got eased out and clients also started expanding on the current programs. So, the ramp-up of the programs that we had won in the first half of the year and also the new start that\u2019s happened in the second half of the year helped us to really get better revenues in the last quarter.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Specifically when you say that win rate has improved, does that suggest that you feel like you are gaining share from the traditional firms in those segments at a more rapid rate?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Most of our transformation program being used against the traditional global SI. We have been getting into the last two or three, in that most of the transformation programs that we participate and we are winning against the global SIs.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "I got it, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Bourgeois. Our question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi, just curious what your CapEx assumption was for FY11 and you know, is this an effort to sort of ramp up the SEZs that you try to rebuild capacity?", "V. Balakrishnan", "We will spend something like about $240 million this year, again something like about $130 million in 2010. And essentially go towards investment in SEZs. We have no investment in the STPs. All incremental growth will go towards SEZs. The investment in SEZ and capacity into the SCW lead to a lower tax rate we have to see because it normally takes one or two years for the impact to be felt. But we are expanding in the Pune SEZ, we are expanding in the Chennai SEZ, the Hyderabad SEZ, Thiruvananthapuram SEZ, Mangalore SEZ, Mysore SEZ etcetera. So, it\u2019s only SEZ and SEZ where we are investing right now.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Just want to follow-up here on the employee turnover, if we sort of try to convert the number to quarterly annualized to fairly big increase here and you mentioned that it\u2019s really the June quarter which is the historically large quarter. And I understand the re-architecting argument, but is it, are the employees struggling with this new concept, I mean is it a cultural issue where they are just \u2013 they are not used to this and you are going to have a turnover remain high for a while as people sort of try to move to this more targeted model.", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "Well, you are partially right. We have gone through gut-wrenching change, which we felt it as very essential. It is done in a open consensual manner and everybody signs off till it actually \u2013 and I understand what it means. So, we have gone through that. But if we look at quarter four, we had 3,500 people leaving the technology services part of the business, of which 3,000 were people who were not trainees. 500 trainees were not confirmed and they had to leave because they did not get the requisite marks to pass at the end of training. In this quarter, we could see a small uptick up from the previous quarter, because it\u2019s typically the quarter when people leave to do their MBAs or MTechs, and every year we have maybe 2,000 to 2,500 people doing that. That\u2019s why we said that it could be an uptick. For the compensation hike and the fact that we have got so much of exciting promotion mean we believe the second quarter that is the July-August quarter, the attrition rate would come down.", "In the January-February quarter, we also saw some targeted poaching by some companies to our staff. I mean, they hired some of our people then asked them to talk to their buddies and increase the incentives and there was some targeted poaching, except that they are now feeling the consequence of that, because their own people are asking for more money as they hired laterals at a higher rate. But that is behind us. There is some challenges with high raise, and we have addressed most of it. We set up working groups and working groups have worked out, and when we rolled out this compensation plan, and when the senior leadership spoke to people, they are extremely happy with what we have done. So, I think the change has come about and the change is here and we are prepared for the future. And I do believe after this compensation hike, we have an unfair advantage against competitors.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Have you done any customer satisfaction surveys lately to sort of check to see if this re-architecting may spill over into some challenges on the customer satisfaction side?", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "No, I don\u2019t think we have had an impact on CSAT. We do an annual customer satisfaction. So, ours will be, you know, the annual will (inaudible) but we do keep a pulse with our clients. There has not been an impact as a result of the limited attrition that we have had.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you. Congrats.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Caso. Our next question is from the line of David Grossman of Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Thank you. You know, I got dropped from the call, so I apologize if this was a bit earlier, but I am wondering if you could help me understand the dynamics, you know, among the Top 10 accounts? It looks like, you know, therefore sequentially was lower than the balance of the business and then does that have any relationship to the change in pricing that you saw on the offshore business sequentially which on a constant currency basis, it looked like, you know, that was down sequentially as well?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, actually this is seasonal in nature. If you look at our last quarter results, you will see that our Top 10 grew faster than the rest of the company. In this quarter, the Top 10 has declined by 1.2%, which is actually not \u2013 it is a very seasonal thing. While that is true, our Top 25 grew faster than the company. The Top 25 grew by 7.6%, while the company grew by 5.2%. So, there is no secular trend. You know, depending on the quarter-to-quarter, either it is a Top 10 which is driving the growth or the Top 25 or the rest of the company.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "And in terms of the revenue productivity, Shibu, on the offshore side, was that mix or was there anything in particular driving that down sequentially on a constant currency basis?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Right, the revenue productivity driving down is surely a pricing issue. It is the tailwind impact of all the pricing renegotiations which we did over the last 18 months. We are no more seeing that kind of pricing renegotiations. There are sporadic renegotiations going on even today, which I will consider as part of our normal business. For the next year guidance, we have assumed the revenue productivity to be flat. One another point, when we started the year, we had predicted a revenue productivity drop of 5% for the year, and we have ended the year with a 4% revenue productivity drop, which is better than what we expected in the beginning of the year.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay. So, should we assume the revenue productivity that we are seeing, you know, on the offshore site to be relatively flat with the fourth quarter down, so the adjustments that came in the March quarter then would persist into next year, so the $54,900 on the offshore site would be a good number to use for next year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, so in the blended level, I would expect it to persist through the year. There may be some marginal difference between onsite and offshore revenue productivity depending on the kind of service mix. For example, if our transformational work goes up and maybe the offshore revenue productivity will go up a little bit, but from a blended revenue productivity perspective, at this point in time, we are expecting that the revenue productivity will remain flat through the next fiscal year. That is the assumption we have made for guidance.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And then, you know, Mohan, you talked about, you know the changes in the compensation and the workforce and some of your policies on promotions, is there any reason to think that you know, we would depart from annual kind of wage hikes which have been historical factors with the exception of last year, which was an anomaly, or do you think we maybe you know, kind of faced with compensation increases that may happen more than once during the course of the fiscal year.", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "David, I think annual compensation is here to stay. There is no move anywhere in the industry for a half yearly or whatever it is. Annual is here to say. We must remember that last year was a very tough year, and people have to adjust with the new paradigm in the industry. So, annual is here to say, but you will have differential comp across the industry that will impact different companies in very different ways depending upon the ability to pay, depending upon what rates they charge and come on in the marketplace, and I do believe it will be a bulwark against some large companies trying to commoditize the services. So, I think you know what is happening is a very good thing, but it will be annual as part of the C.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And then, just lastly on currency, in terms of the structure of the contracts that have been signed over the last 12 months, is there any trend or propensity to share some of the FX volatility with the customers or are you still bearing the majority of the fluctuations in currency on the new deals?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, it\u2019s Bala here. We don\u2019t try that because the cross currency volatility is too high now. In some of the contracts, we have clauses to protect us for a moment of plus or minus 5% on the currency front, but not all customers agree to it, because currency is something which we have to manage. So, we do try that wherever clients agree, we try to incorporate that. But most of the clients wants us to take the currency rate.", "David Grossman \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Grossman. Our next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Hi guys, nice quarter. Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions here. Out of the 47 new accounts, how many were in financial services and if you could break down the manufacturing and retail numbers, too?", "T. V. Mohandas Pai", "Out of the 47 in financial services, 14, excuse me on financial services.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "And in Europe.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "All right, great. And then, just you know, I think someone was alluding to this early, but I am just trying to understand this, with the increase in discretionary spend, especially package implementation, are you seeing folks come back and actually start doing, you know, SAP, Oracle package implementations. What sort of work is that in sort of, you know, is that larger scale stuff or is larger scale stuff still to happen and this is more like upgrades and sort of adding bells and whistles and modules, how should we think of that?", "Chandra Shekar Kakal", "Yes, when we talk of package implementation and business transformation kind of program and all that, it is mostly the global rollout kind of unfinished agenda of large global corporations where they have enterprise licenses available with them and have not really rolled it out completely to the entire organization. Not all the modules, not to all the subsidiaries, not to all the geographies, the rollout is happening now. It\u2019s also the instant consolidation kind of work where they had maybe 25 different decisions in the past, they are trying to consolidate into maybe one or two or three instances. Upgrades have started appearing in certain areas like in PeopleSoft, we are seeing quite a few upgrades happening. In other areas, they did so much. It is a combination of all of these to keep driving growth now in SAP and Oracle.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Got it. And then just trying to, one of your large deals, I just saw the announcement with Microsoft regarding sort of management of their internal IT systems, could you provide a little more color around sort of how big that is and sort of just, sort of box it for us a little more?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Hello, this is B. G. Srinivas. The size of the deal specifically is it\u2019s more than $150 million over three years. This is a deal which in partnership with Unisys, we are managing their entire IT infrastructure and this is over a period of three years, the deal. The scope of engagement would also mean that we will work on their products suite both in terms of service delivery and manage their IT services worldwide. This also includes streamlining their processes, simplifying support service, while at the same time, we are lowering the enterprise cost through the use of the latest Microsoft solutions, which also includes Windows 7.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great, great. And I guess when you look at these deals, the PeopleSoft upgrades and everything else, you know, you described that win rates had gone up against the global SIs. But have you seen win rates go up against the other offshore players as well or are you sort of seeing increased win rates against the TCS and the Wipros of the world?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "In most large transformation deals, we do not encounter too many offshore players, and that is more we compete with the global SIs and in Europe, more the local large European players.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Yes, that\u2019s right.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, we have very less occasions there we take offshore players head-on in transformation deals.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great. That\u2019s all my questions. Thanks for taking my call guys. Good quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Suri. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. I would now like to pass it on back to Bangalore for any closing comments from there.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, thank you everyone. I really appreciate your participation on this call. You can contact us during the quarter through Sandeep Mahindroo or Shekar Narayanan in India, and we look forward to further interactions with you during the quarter. Thank you very much again for participation.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Mahindroo. Thank you gentlemen of the management. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys Technologies Limited, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us on the Chorus Call Conferencing Service and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

(Operator instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys Technologies Limited. Thank you and over to you Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Rochelle [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and wish you all a very Happy New Year. Welcome to this call to discuss Infosys earnings release for the quarter ending December 31, 2010. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York.", "Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S. D. Shibulal; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management.", "We will start the call with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter and year ending March 31, 2011. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'll now like to pass it on to the Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks, Sandeep and first, let me wish all of you a very Happy New Year. May this decade be much better than the last decade.", "Coming to the quarter three financial year 2011, we had all-round good performance. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.585 billion and this is higher than the upper end of our guidance, which was $1,562 million. So the revenues grew sequentially by 6%; in constant currency terms revenue increased by 4.7%; volume increase was 3.1%. We had revenue per employee increase of 1.6% in blended terms.", "We added 40 new clients; last quarter it was 27. The top 25 clients grew by 4.3%, non-top 25 by 7.4%. We added 11,067 employees against our projection of 11,000. For the year we are looking at 40,000. Attrition has come down. If you look at the attrition for the last three quarters, it has been steadily declining. Two quarters back it was 5,400 and now it's about 3,500. So, attrition in absolute terms have come.", "We have been able to maintain our margins, utilization is still high and utilization will have an impact in the future, but utilization is about 81.9% in Q3; last quarter it was 82.7%, and including trainees it is actually now low, so it's 72.7% and that's actually good for the future.", "When we told our customers and talked to them about the budgets, the indication is that the budgets are up slightly. So, it is a positive environment. They are all saying that the offshore allocation should increase and nothing bad happens, we believe that next year is going to be a normal year for the IT services industry.", "If we look at client additions, if we look at growth \u2013 broad based growth, if we look at the various industry segments for Infosys, if we look at service lines, if we look at our positioning in the market in terms of how analysts perceive Infosys, our clients perceive Infosys, our own relationship with them, we believe that we are in a good position to take advantage of the growth opportunities provided and we're continuing to build capacity. We will recruit 40,000 people this year as we have projected, and so we'll continue to build capacity. We are already recruiting for the next financial year, and we will update you as we go along on that. So, we are optimistic about the coming year.", "And this quarter one of the interesting things that we saw happen was that there was no budget flush. Normally, there would be a budget flush in the third quarter. Though third and fourth quarters typically are slow quarters for us, we would have seen a budget flush, but we didn't see that this quarter, because we believe the companies had spent their money in the earlier quarters, and we saw that. We saw good volume growth in the last three quarters. So there was no budget flush this quarter. That was very interesting in this quarter.", "So, now let me pass it on to Shibulal to give you more details by segment, by industry, et cetera.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good evening, everyone. Happy New Year. Let me add to what Kris talked about. Our growth has been all around. Our top 25 clients grew by 4.3% and revenue from the non-top 25 grew by 7.4%, which adds up to 6% in constant currency terms, which means that the growth is wide-based and both the top 25 and the non-top 25 clients grew in Q3.", "The million-dollar clients, which were 337 last quarter, in Q3 it is 350, which also shows the quality of clients which we are adding. Today our focus is to add clients, which are of high quality, mostly Fortune 500 or Global 2000 and that is showing up in our million-dollar clients going up.", "This quarter we have added 40 new clients and most of them are in the categories, which I just mentioned. 29 clients contribute more than $50 million in revenue right now in Q3 on an LTM basis, and this number was 27 last quarter. Our penetration into the Fortune 500 clients have gone up. It stands at 134 for Fortune 500 U.S. and 149 for Fortune 500 Global, which is also a good improvement. Our DSO is better. It is 62 days compared to 63 days last quarter.", "Now, let me give you some color on the region and the segment-wise growth. North America has marginally come down and rest of the world has gone up marginally. I believe it's a reflection of our increase in product sales. Finacle is doing very well and some of the other small products, which we have in the markets, is also finding traction. Our revenue from products has gone up to 5.2% and some of it is reflected in the rest of the world.", "Fixed price is up from 39.9% to 41.2%, again in line with increasing our fixed price and also new models of engagement. Number of clients, active clients is 612, that's an increase of 20 from the last quarter; last quarter it was 592. Our largest client is 4.6% and our repeat business is 97.6%.", "We are expanding in all our three service lines, Transformation, Operation, and Innovation. On the Transformation front, we are running multiple Transformation programs across the globe for our clients and the pipeline is also very strong.", "On the Operations side, we have a very strong large-deal pipeline. We design our large deals anywhere from $50 million to $300 million, and we have a good pipeline. Last half, we had closed nine of them. We have closed a couple of them in Q3 and we're expecting more closures in Q4.", "We're also seeing good traction with our Innovation side of the business, which is mostly products, platforms, and solutions and new models of engagement. New models of engagement, today is very well accepted with the client, and more and more deals are being restructured under the new models of engagement.", "With that, now let me hand over to Bala.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning, friends. This quarter has come out much better than what we had guided for in the beginning of the quarter. The revenue grew by 6%. The volume growth is 3.1% and the pricing went up by 1.6%, mainly because of the cost currency moves. In constant currency, the pricing went up by 0.5%.", "This quarter the rupee appreciated by 3.5%. The average rate for last quarter was 46.48; it was 44.83 for the quarter. So, there was appreciation of 3.5%, which impacted the margin by close to 1.5%, 1.6%, but due to the pricing going up by 1.6% that impact had been offset. So, the gross margin came out similar to what we have seen in the second quarter. Even the operating margin remained at the same level at 30.2%. The other income was slightly up because the yield has gone up during the quarter. The effective yield we got for the current quarter was 6.8%.", "We have a hedging position of $587 million. We have seen the cross currencies moving again this quarter and we are continuing with our program of hedging up to next two quarters at any point of time; we are not changing that policy. During the current quarter the Australian dollar appreciated against U.S. dollar by around 9%, euro appreciated by 5%, and GBP appreciated by 2%.", "Net-net, the effective tax rate for the quarter went up to 27%. For the nine months, it is around 26.5%. The tax rates slightly up during the current quarter, mainly because of the increase in other income. Otherwise, for the full year, it could be closer to 26.5%. We had guided for 1% to 2% growth for next quarter, because typically, the third and fourth quarter are soft quarters for us. And looking at the environment, we want to be cautious. Our guidance for EPS is almost same as what we have seen in the third quarter, I think it is increasing by only $0.01.", "We started the year with 16% to 18% growth in revenues, now we are guiding for 26% growth in revenues for the higher end. So, I think we have done well. The things have improved from the beginning, but looking at the environment, we want to be cautious. If you look at all the budgets from the clients, most of them happened on time, and most of them are talking about a flat to slightly increase in budget. So, looking at all that, we are optimistic about next year, but we are challenged in the near-term because of uncertainty.", "With this, I will conclude. Now, we'll open up the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi, gentlemen. My first question here is, just on the IT budgets, I think you talked about the budget cycle being maybe more normalized next year. Does that mean that your visibility will increase and would the derivative from that be an increase in discretionary spending? I am just trying to get a little color on what '11 budgets look like?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. We will have normal visibility. See, typically, we have for the next quarter almost 95%, 96% visibility, for the next four quarters, 65% to 70% visibility. That's the model we use to compute our guidance and things like that. Our guidance is a bottom-up computation. We know from each of our clients what are their budgets and what they propose to spend with us. About 4% to 5% is new business, that is, from customers we don't have it today, new customers that come in. So, we have a way of building up the model bottom up, with this particular visibility and things like that and that's the model we use.", "To your second question, yes, discretionary spend is clearly back. We have seen, one, discretionary spend come back. We've had Transformation projects, large programs, multiyear rollouts and things like that. Second, we are seeing investment in technologies like cloud and things like that. So, again, to me that is discretionary spend. Third, we are also seeing large deals back on the table. Of course, this quarter we have had some small amount of wins, but typically towards the end of the year, you don't sanction any large project.", "But if you look at the last three quarters, we have had 10 large deals, few of them $100 million and plus. So, large deals are back on table. These are \u2013 of course, 40 new clients added this quarter, 27 last quarter. Out of this 40, several of them are actually Fortune 500 or Global 1000. So, a good indicator to say that we are in a normal environment.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And just maybe you can help us reconcile, the headcount guidance had gone up, but it seems like your expectations is that discretionary spending coming back and the large deals coming back, that the environment will be better next year. Maybe you could just help us reconcile sort of what we saw this quarter and the headcount guidances and your positive commentary going forward?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Our headcount guidance is for this fiscal, the fiscal, which ends on March 31, 2011. We said at the beginning of the year, we will hire 25,000 people. We are ending the year, which is March 31st, hiring 40,000 people. So, we've gone up significantly from what we said we will start at the beginning of the year. Also, for the next year, we are proposing to offer 25,000 in the campuses. Already about 20,000 have been already offered. So, we will give you the number for next year in April, but it's an indication that we are looking at growth in the next year or so.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And just my last question here just on pricing, it looks like it's been going up over the last couple of quarters, and your margin guidance annually has been improving. May be you could just talk a little bit about the trend in pricing you're expecting next year, and then anything on the margin side. Thanks.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Again, I will give you our current position on pricing. We believe pricing will be flat and it's stable. Having said that, we have been able to get some price increases in certain cases, which we believe is positive, because, again, clients are willing to consider price increases. We have been able to get some price increases and that has also had positive impact this quarter. Out of the revenue per employee increase of 1.6%, if you take it in constant currency terms, it's only 0.5%, but that is based on rate increases also.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Thanks. Kris, you're talking about a normal growth here next year for the industry. Can you kind of define what normal kind of means in terms of numbers? And then given some of the deceleration in revenue growth metrics we've seen whether it's North America and Europe and also on the service line and package implementation, was there anything unusual in the demand picture for the quarter? Thanks.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, Moshe, when you look at what NASSCOM came up with about a year or so back, they said that the industry will grow approximately 11% compounded over a 10-year period 2010 to 2020. The industry in the last one year has been growing around mid-teens, 15%. So, when I say a normal year, I'm assuming that the industry would grow at around 15% \u2013 mid-teens, maybe high-teens actually. So, that's the range that I'm looking at when I say normal year for the industry. Now, what percentage will Infosys get out of that, we will give you that guidance in April. In the past we have been able to capture growth, and try and grow beyond industry average, but we will see. Even based on, as you said, where we are today, the momentum, et cetera, we'll give you a guidance in April for next year.", "Then the second part of the question is, why I believe it's \u2013 and I gave you data points in terms of number of customer wins, the number of large deals, number of \u2013 the growth in top 25, rest of the pack, various data points we have, which, again, point to a normal year for next year for us.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay. And what about some of the deceleration and the revenue growth metrics you've seen for the quarter, North America was up 4%, the quarter ago it was up 8%. We've seen a deceleration, a kind of similar deceleration in Europe. We've seen some of those trends also by service line. Was there anything unusual in the demand picture during the quarter or this is purely related to just seasonality?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Partly, seasonality, number of working days, one working day less, we had some client closures based on holidays between December 21st to January 1st. We had projected only 4% growth this quarter. So, some of those things. Also our utilization has been high for two, three quarters now, more than 80%. Actually that will have an impact on growth at some point, because our inability to start the projects right, et cetera. So, we have taken action. At the end of the quarter, actually, the utilization was closer to 78%. So, we have considered all these factors.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Shashi Bhushan of Prabhudas Lilladher. Please go ahead.", "Shashi Bhushan \u2013 Prabhudas Lilladher", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, is there any change in IT budget spend by our top 20 clients in calendar '10, including budgetary flush compared to what they are budgeting for calendar year '11?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "What I will do is, I will ask Ashok who handles the largest portfolio from an industry perspective to comment and that will give you an indication of what we see in retail, manufacturing, et cetera.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Yes, hi, this is Ashok. So, from a budgetary perspective, overall, the budgets are slightly higher than where they were last year. Of course, the interesting thing is that for our top accounts as well as on an average basis, the commentary that we are hearing is that CapEx will actually go up, which is from a services perspective is good news, but on a deferred basis it will take \u2013 there is a phase lag between that investment and the translation to services. The other is that the offshoring component again has been validated to that \u2013 that it will be higher, so they have ratified that.", "There is an expectation of continuing to essentially use the budget in the same fashion that it was done in the previous year. So, of course, having a budget is one thing, getting it on time is one thing, but the spending is a completely different matter altogether. And so that will be, we understand, will be done in the same way as last year, as FY'10 in terms of the discipline, et cetera. So, basically from what we hear, our large accounts, our top 20 accounts and on the average for the sector in the North American market, across industries, this is essentially how it looks.", "Shashi Bhushan \u2013 Prabhudas Lilladher", "Also, earlier in the conference call, we said that because of some customer closure between Christmas and New Year, we have some man-days loss and also because of one day lower working days we lost out some part of revenue. However, for the next quarter, we are guiding for 1% to 2% quarter-on-quarter growth, which means if we adjust for these holidays, we are guiding for nearly muted quarter four FY '11. Any specific reasons for such softness in the demand all of a sudden?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "See, historically, Q3 and Q4 are slow quarters for us. Q3, because of the holidays, Q4 because the timing of the spend after the budgets are finalized is very, very important. And we have seen that sometimes they take a little bit of time before the spending starts, and that's why our Q1 of the next fiscal and Q2 of the next fiscal are actually much better quarters, and then Q3 and Q4 muted. That's the historical data we have. So, that's the reason why we are cautious about Q4.", "Shashi Bhushan \u2013 Prabhudas Lilladher", "Okay, sir. That\u2019s all from me, sir. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Vafi of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Vafi \u2013 Jefferies", "Hi, gentlemen, good evening. I was wondering if we could get a little more color on your commentary around the percentage of budget going for offshore increasing in calendar '11, the types of potential projects where you could see a positive mix shift, and any other color you want to provide there?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So, as we said, majority of the budgets have closed and they are either flat or marginally up, which means on an average it is marginally up. We are also seeing continued interest in Global Delivery Model. Most of our clients have told us that they will continue to increase their spend and activity with us. We also believe that there is a reason to spend for our clients.", "So, if you look at the banking and capital markets space there is risk and compliance, which will drive discretionary spend. If you look at manufacturing, it is about efficiency, building a smarter organization and productivity improvements.", "If you look at retail, it is about the digital consumer and the new consumer experience. If you look at telecom, there is a regulatory change, which is coming through of Net neutrality, which will mean that the industry has to spend. And all of these transformations, whether it is risk and compliance, whether it is digital consumer, smarter organization, it will require services starting from consulting all the way to implementation. So, that gives us confidence at this point that the budget will be spent and we stand a very fair chance of getting a very good share of this spend.", "Joseph Vafi \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And then secondly, it sounded like Finacle was pretty strong. What's driving that exactly now, is it better penetration of the product, is it perhaps a better demand environment coming from banks, some more color there would be appreciated as well?", "Haragopal Mangipudi", "So, this is Haragopal. Yes, in a way, there are two drivers to the growth s we see. One is our Transformation capability as a differentiator is being acknowledged in the market, particularly in the segment two, in regional segment one banks. And so we are scoring there and there is good growth there. Second, as an Innovation partner, the initiatives, which we have taken, and the solutions, which we launched, including the one like, mobile banking and the direct banking, and rural banking suite, et cetera, are well received in the market and we are seeing the growth on that dimension as well.", "Joseph Vafi \u2013 Jefferies", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Vafi. Our next question is from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mark Zgutowicz \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. Just a question on the mix of your hiring plans, it looks like last couple of quarters laterals have been higher than normal and I'm just curious what that trajectory looks like entering FY'11? And if we assume higher wages and attrition is supported by more stable environment over that period, I'm just curious how the mix of freshers and laterals look, meaning, do we have to see a continued up-trend in terms of freshers as a overall percentage of your mix higher than we've seen just over the last few quarters? Thanks", "Haragopal Mangipudi", "Last year has been very unique for the fresher-lateral ratio, because we started with 30,000 people, and we anticipated that we could add 70% freshers, but as the year went by, we had a higher attrition and we increased the number to 40,000. So, the fresher-lateral ratio was very different. Out of 40,000 people, we're probably hiring about close to 10,000 for the BPO. That means 30,000 for services. Out of 30,000, we're going to have a fresher ratio of something like 50%. 50% is going to be lateral. And for next year, hopefully, the fresher ratio to go close to 60% to 65%, because we have enough time to plan for next year and for next year we're making 26,000 offers in colleges, which should translate into something like maybe 18,000 to 20,000 coming in from the fresher side for next year. We don't have a number for the full of next year, because we give a number in April, but certainly for next year the ratio of fresher to lateral should go up in favor of freshers. Also, I'd say, going up the value chain, we could see increasing hiring of laterals for the consulting and enterprise solutions level.", "Mark Zgutowicz \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you. I was wondering if we can go back just the pricing for a minute. Just looking at it over the last several quarters, it appears that this is the first sequential increase in offshore constant currency pricing that we have had in several quarters, perhaps as many as eight or nine. Is there anything you can tell us what may be changing in the environment that's maybe driving that and any other insights into perhaps what may be going on in the employment front and some of these (inaudible) or wage increases that maybe impacting pricing?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, pricing went up by 3% last quarter and 1.6% this quarter. Last quarter, majority of the pricing was driven by portfolio shift because when we do more of transformational work, the average revenue productivity goes up and even when we do more of consulting \u2013 if you do the advisory services work, the per person revenue productivity is higher. So, it was driven by that. Even this quarter, there is \u2013 we've had some pricing increases, some of the yearly COLA, the yearly pricing increases have kicked in now, and that is showing up slowly in our revenue productivity. Even this quarter, our consulting revenue has considerably gone up. So that also has contributed towards it. Now, regarding the compensation increase, we have done some very strong compensation increase over the last 18 months or so. We expect the compensation increase to be moderate in the coming year, but according to the industry standard.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So, again, just looking at the offshore constant currency increase in revenue productivity, is it fair to assume that a big chunk of that is related to the wage increases or is it all these other factors that you mentioned being the primary driver?", "S. D. Shibulal", "David, it is not related to the wage increase. Of course, we can say that costs are going up, but we have to look at individual contracts. This cost of living increase is actually a contractual term. It's built into our contracts, and sometimes, the client allows us to activate that or allows us to increase. Sometimes, they will come back and negotiate and say, don't increase it. So, we were able to get those increases \u2013 some of those increases this year and that has helped us.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then, secondly, Kris, I think in your opening comments, I think you said that attrition was moderating. And as I recall the number that you've put in your release is an LTM number. So, can you give us a sense just quarterly what the attrition rates have looked like and how they have trended over the course of the year?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, on the services business side, the attrition in the last three quarters, including this quarter \u2013 this quarter's attrition number, absolute number is around 3,500. 4,200 is last quarter and the previous quarter was 5,400. So, 5,400, 4,200, 3,500, so you can see that it is actually coming down.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I got it. Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Grossman. Our next question is from the line of Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Thank you and congratulations on a very good execution. First, the impact of higher oil prices on your business, if you look two years back, oil was at $34 a barrel and today it is $90 a barrel. We are in a very high global inflation environment and our research has historically said \u2013 indicated that higher oil prices have a second derivative impact on IT budgets. And I am not \u2013 I will not be surprised if over the next six months, even through currently the IT budgets seem to be the same as before or probably a little higher, it doesn't take much time for IT budgets to just collapse.", "What my question is, are you seeing any symptoms, any difference in the way customer is engaging you, which may indicate possible collapse of IT budgets? For example, are they asking you to write more documentation that is relatively more documentation of the work that you may do or spending more time relatively on say, planning processes or asking you to shrink your large implementation into very, very small chunks, with a definite start-date and a definite end-date or anything you're seeing, which is little bit different or unexpected from the customer than before, that\u2019s all for me?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Very, very interesting analysis, maybe I should get a copy of this, because the correlation you're creating is actually very, very interesting and first time, I'm actually hearing that. But strangely enough, some of the things you've talked about, customers looking at the return on investment, doing detailed planning, sometimes taking a large Transformation project into smaller chunks, six months period and things like that, the multi-year, multi-million dollar projects broken into smaller chunks, many of these things are happening. But we attribute that to the environment in which we are. We have just come out of a downturn, customers are still conscious about cost.", "They're unwilling to make long-term investments at this point or long-term commitments, not investments, long-term commitments at this point. They want to make sure that they're getting returns in short periods or they get benefits in shorter periods of time and things like that. So, many of the things you said, we are seeing, but we attribute that to the environment in which we are. The overhang from the downturn is still there, there is still uncertainty in the environment. We, of course, did not connect this with the oil price. It will be interesting to maybe get a detailed analysis of that. That will be a very interesting study.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Chowdhry. Our next question is from the line of Nabil Elsheshai of Pacific Crest.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, previously, telcos have been weak, it looks like. I think you had commented last quarter there were signs of it improving, but that obviously hasn't materialized. So, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in that vertical? And then you mentioned Net neutrality potentially driving spend. I was hoping you could maybe provide a little more color on that comment.", "Subhash Dhar", "Yes, hi, this is Subhash Dhar. You are right. I think our expectations in calendar year 2010 was that telco would bounce back, but apparently they did not and it was a surprise for us also, but if you look at what happened with this \u2013 the big debate around Net neutrality and why I pick on that is because telcos have been very clear that they don't see any monetization opportunities for their investments and they have been holding back on their CapEx among other reasons. This is one of the biggest reasons they have been holding back. This is not just in the U.S., it's there in most developed countries, where the net is seen as an area where they cannot price differently. So, that has come to an interesting point at the end of December when the FCC actually ruled that there is a limited authority now for the telcos to charge differently for the usage and charge based on the usage for the kind of data that gets transported over the network.", "That by itself is not enough for them to get new revenue streams. They will also have to develop new revenue models, new services and so on, but from a regulatory perspective, I think it's a big relief. So, once again, I think in 2011, I am more optimistic and so are many other industry people like me, but we'll see. I mean, there are a few other things, which need to come and fall in place over the next one or two months, especially the budgets, as they get finalized, will determine \u2013 especially, the CapEx budgets will tell us whether or not this has encouraged the phone companies to spend more, and not just phone companies, also the cable guys. And if that happens, we believe it will be a couple of quarters down the road when the OpEx will open up to support that CapEx, which is when we will see our spends coming in.", "Having said that, we are already seeing some more up-take on the wireless side, as the wireless industry is maturing. Their behaviors are becoming similar to the wireline industry, because they have need for efficiencies and cost containment and so on. Although it's just a few big large ones that are taking to the Global Delivery Model at this point, but it is an increasing trend, especially in Europe. Not sure if I answered your question, but that's where we are.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest", "Yes, it\u2019s helpful. Thank you. I was wondering, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but on the price increases, I was wondering if you could clarify if that improvement is due to mix, maybe more shift to discretionary or application development versus maintenance or if it\u2019s like-for-like price increase that you are seeing?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, last quarter was about business mix change. This quarter was actually in our contracts, we have cost of living increase \u2013 yearly cost of living increase included. So, some customers allowed us to take advantage of that. And so automatically the rates went down and that's what is reflected.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest", "And then last question. I guess, by each vertical you commented that the high level reasons for continuing to spend, maybe if you could provide a little more color, particularly in your largest ones like financial services on what project priorities, what are the highest priorities in terms of technology or application that you are seeing in those verticals?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So, in financial services across the board, especially in the American market we are continuing to see M&A spending that is continuing. We're seeing a lot more traction build up on operational efficiency, which has moved now from just cost-cutting to making the client more competitive, so, it's actually more investment on the revenue side of the balance sheet. And the one thing that is different that we're seeing traction on and expect to see a lot more of, going forward is on three items, one is fraud prevention; the second is risk management and the third and probably one of the largest that we will see for a while is the entire area of regulatory compliance. So, whether it's in the area of the new technology implications or the implications for the business arising from Dodd-Frank or whether it is from Basel III or FSA regulations, et cetera, we are seeing \u2013 beginning to see traction in conversations, and we do believe that that will be as big for us as M&A was in the last 18 months.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. The current participant is no longer in the question queue. We will take the next question, which is from the line of Mitali Ghosh of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ms. Mitali Ghosh, your line is now unmuted. If you have a question, please go ahead now. There is no response from the line of this participant. Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good evening. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your business process management area, particularly what types of service are of interest, say financing accounting or what verticals are showing the most growth? And also sort of where are the margins in this group now and where could they go? Thank you.", "Swami Swaminathan", "Hi, Swami here. Yes, we've had a fairly good quarter. The third quarter we grew about 7% over the previous one, and on a year-on-year basis, around 23%. The demand continues to be reasonably strong in the last two quarters. As we speak, we are in dialog with about six odd prospective clients with whom we believe we should be able to close our contracts in the next quarter. Having said that, the margins have also had a uptick in the sense that we have been able to move our margins up by a three percentage points on quarter-on-quarter. Basically, the growth is coming in from a couple of industry verticals, which is really in the manufacturing vertical and also on the BFSI space.", "On the horizontal service offerings, we are seeing fairly strong growth in the financing and accounting area and as well as on the sourcing and procurement side, which includes strategic sourcing as well. Very clearly the expectations of clients have moved on. It's moved on from depending on transcational processing to a much higher value-added services. And you would see that in the last quarter, though we have had a revenue growth of 7% the headcount has actually come down by three percentage points. And that is really because of the fact that the revenue productivity per employee in this business it has steadily gone up, and as we speak, revenue productivity on a quarter-on-quarter basis has also gone up by about 5%.", "The reason for this is really about our having migrated in fairly good numbers from the routine commoditized services to high end value-added services in the financing and accounting space, for instance moving away, not just moving away, but also extending say from a traditional account receivable or an account payable to the full \u2013 the whole nine yards of general ledger accounting, fixed assets, and also in terms of analytics and CFA reporting and analytics. So, that's clearly the move that we're seeing in the marketplace at this point in time.", "We had also become fairly globalized in a sense as we speak today we have more centers outside of India than in India. In India, we have five centers, outside of India, we have seven as we speak. The new centers that we established in China, Mexico and Brazil last year have seen fair amount of growth from companies and multinationals who are operating in those territories. That obviously has enabled us to see a fair amount of growth in areas outside of India. Very clearly the better utilization, operating efficiencies, scaling up on value-added services has really led to the kind of growth that we are seeing.", "And we believe that this focus and this expectations of clients to sort of move from pure play commoditized services to a consolidated IT BPO service offering, specialized platforms that we have been able to rollout in the last couple of quarters is enabling us to move both on the revenue productivity side, on the margin side, and also on the growth side.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you. My other question revolves around the resetting of the pyramid. You mentioned that you thought utilization was a little high at the moment. You hope to bring that down a little bit. Will the sort of the filling in with more freshers and therefore resetting the pyramid, will that be sufficient to offset from a margin perspective the desire to bring utilization down little bit?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "The line was not very clear. Kindly repeat the question.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yes. Kris, you mentioned the desire to reduce utilization from current levels. And I guess my question is, will the addition of freshers and a sort of a resetting of your consulting pyramid, is that sufficient enough of an offset for us to continue to assume that your operating margins can stay right around 30%?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We have traditionally operated between 78% to 80%. And we have been able to achieve the margins in that range, that's number one. Number two, higher utilization, above 80%, reduces our ability to staff programs on time or even to bid very confidently for very large and very fast ramp up programs, so we need that. And please also remember, when we say our utilization is 82%, there is only 8% left, because the 10% goes in the leave, travel, training, recreation, customer closures, all kinds of other things, holidays, so it's only 8% which is kind of small.", "So to answer the question we have comfortably operated between 70% to 80% in the past; that's number one. Number two, see if you look at the utilization including trainees, it's 71%, so cost of those people are already in the system. It is that they are in training and once they come out the utilization will come down. So, the people are already in the system even today. We have 11,000 people in training and that is what \u2013 the trainees once they come into the production, the utilization excluding trainees will come down. So, the point I wanted to try and make is that the cost is already there.", "Ed Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Caso. Our next question is from the line Bhavan Suri with William Blair and Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Company", "Hi, guys. Just a quick question on the non-linear initiatives. Obviously, Finacle had a nice move in its 5% revenue. If you combine that or broke out the non-linear initiatives, could you tell us sort of how they are growing and what percent of revenue they contribute?", "Subhash Dhar", "Yes. So, we break it down into three broad areas. One is, the intellectual property where we will include Finacle, then the platforms and products, other products, and then the third area is, what we call unit of work based pricing models, which is a large services business. Finacle will be approximately four percentage points out of the 10 percentage, but that 10% of our revenues that we talk about in our non-linearity. The rest of the 6% is coming from the unit of work, about 4.5% will be coming from unit of work based pricing, about 1.5% comes from the other intellectual properties and business platforms.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Company", "And then, Subhash, what sort of platforms are you seeing traction, and you've had Hire-to-Retire out there for a while, you've had Flypp there for a while, you've had the Newspaper-In-A-Box, sort of any color on how adoption is going and sort of customer traction in those?", "Subhash Dhar", "Yes, I think the platforms will \u2013 I would call them filling the incubation phase in spite of the fact that we do have quite a few customers, because there is a larger roadmap which needs to be in place. We need to dig deeper in order to make more sales in the markets. So, at this point, I don't think we are counting the revenues significantly within that 10 percentage points. One of the biggest contributor is, the unit of work and some of the license revenues that we are getting from other intellectual properties that we have built over time. We think FY'12 would probably be our first significant year for the platforms to start notching up noticeable revenues.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Company", "Okay. And with that, is the margin on the platforms similar to Finacle where it's better than the services business and so could that help to offset some of the headwinds you face?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "The margins right now are in the development phase. And I think when they become mature, they should be, let us say, ahead of the services business, that's our expectation, because right now there are four clients who have gone live and two of them are in their development phase, they have just gone live maybe a quarter ago, and it has to come to full utilization when we will begin to see margins. Our anticipated margin right now is as per our budget.", "Bhavan Suri \u2013 William Blair and Company", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Suri. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Miller of TechMarketView. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Miller \u2013 TechMarketView", "Yes, good evening, gentlemen. I'd just like to understand better what was dragging back growth in Europe, because if I looked at the Q2 sequential growth, Europe kind of led the pack? But in quarter three just gone, European growth rather lagged the other geographies. What was the reason for those changes?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Europe last quarter was $325 million versus $346 million, 6.3% growth. So, Europe is growing, but as a percentage it's in line at this point, but when you look at what is driving it, it is proactive investment is what is helping us at this point. Even though we find that Europe is lagging behind U.S., by proactive investment we are actually trying to increase the traction in Europe. Does that answer the question?", "Anthony Miller \u2013 TechMarketView", "Not entirely. First I would like to understand what you mean by proactive investments. And perhaps you could highlight if there are any major differences between your major country markets in Europe?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. So, naturally U.K. is the largest market, because it is easier for us to work or do business in U.K. because of the English language. France, Germany, other countries in Europe require us to invest in recruiting local talent so that we can interact with clients in the local language, and things like that, which we are doing now. We are investing significant headcount in France, Germany, et cetera, and that's the proactive investment I said.", "In continental Europe, Belgium, the Nordic countries, France, Germany, Switzerland, these are some of the markets we are proactively investing at this point. In Nordic countries, again, we are able to support from India, but for France and Germany, et cetera, we are able to support provided we have a local front-end.", "Anthony Miller \u2013 TechMarketView", "Okay. And just finally, when would you expect then growth in the European markets to be roughly in line with growth in the U.S. markets?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Our goal ultimately is that Europe should grow faster than U.S. We want to kind of have a balanced portfolio from a geographic perspective. So, long-term actually, we want to grow Europe faster, and that is the reason for proactive investment into Europe. Europe as a market is as large as U.S., as a country \u2013 as a region, it's as large as U.S. as a country, and so proactively, we're investing, so that we can take a better percentage of that market.", "Anthony Miller \u2013 TechMarketView", "Okay. So, that will be organic growth or inorganic?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, currently all our models, our guidance, et cetera, assume organic growth. Proactively, we are looking at acquisitions in Continental Europe that is our strategy to accelerate the growth in these markets, but we have very strict parameters for acquisition. We want to acquire the right company at the right price and with the right set of services and right fit, et cetera. We should be able to integrate the people, retain the people. So, because of that, you will find that there is probably some challenge or let me say, we're cautious about acquisitions because history has shown that 70% of the acquisitions do not deliver the value they are supposed to deliver. So, we're actually little bit cautious about acquisitions.", "Anthony Miller \u2013 TechMarketView", "Thank you very much indeed.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Miller. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to the management to add closing comments.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, thank you all very much. Really appreciate all the questions and your participation in this call. Our investment relationship managers are available. We are also available for any calls, any discussions during the quarter and looking forward to interacting with you during the quarter or as part of next quarter's results. Thank you again.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys Technologies Limited that concludes this conference call.

As a reminder for the duration of this conference all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode, and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today\u2019s opening remarks. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys. Technologies Limited. Thank you, and over to you Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Rochelle. Good morning everybody in the conference call to discuss Infosys earnings release for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2011. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and M.D., Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S.D. Shibulal, and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with the other members of the senior management team.", "We will start the call with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter followed by the outlook for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 and year ending March 31, 2012. Subsequently we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of this risk is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I will now like to pass it on to Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thanks, Sandeep and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone. Thank you for participating in this call at quarter end for financial year quarter four and for financial year 2011. We ended the quarter with revenue of $1,602 million. Our guidance was $1,601 million, $1,617 million, so we are at the slightly above the lower end. The revenue grew sequentially by 1.1%.", "We crossed the $6 billion mark and we have added in the last one year about $1.2 billion in revenues so good growth for the year. We have been able to sustain the operating margin within narrowband. We ended the quarter with about 29% operating margins. Utilization was lower. Utilization is about 75.7% excluding Chinese and we recruited 8,930 employees during the quarter versus what we said 5,800. So that had an impact and that\u2019s partly the reason.", "We are investing for the future. For next year, we are planning to have 45,000 employees approximately. We expect the growth in the next year to be between 18% and 20%. We expect operating margin to be impacted by about 300 basis points, 100 basis points or 1% because of rupee appreciation.", "The balance again because we have assumed a lower utilization and the reason for this is simple, when we look at this year when utilization crossed 80%, we saw that customer service levels came down and we \u2013 we had some issues in staffing, some projects were not taken up and things like that. And so, we wanted to make sure that we truly are ahead of the growth curve and we are investing for the future and that\u2019s reflected in the way we look at our investments into the future.", "We added 34 new clients, so client additions are good, large projects have come in, Shibu will talk about them. We are recruiting people. We are getting recognition in the market in terms of how we\u2019re positioned, how we\u2019re perceived. We are also investing in aligning ourselves better to the clients from an industry perspective as well as where the clients are spending money. Traditionally, if you look at 10 years back, we have been primarily in the operate side of the business. Today more and more we are doing lot of transformational projects for our clients. And in the future, we also want to look at innovations and how we can help them in their innovation cycle and things like that.", "So we\u2019re broadening our ability to serve our clients and that\u2019s the transformation that we\u2019re making as part of Infosys 3.0, which we believe again will serve us well in the future, which will serve \u2013 which will allow us to serve our clients better in the future. So these changes are in play in already and we believe that we\u2019re ready to respond to the market demands and respond to growth opportunities that we see in the market. As I said our revenue guidance is 18% to 20% for next year. And, Bala will of course give you details of how we look at the margin next year and how we look at the EPS next year.", "With this I will hand over to my colleague, S. D. Shibulal will talk about the various segments and how we\u2019re doing in the market.", "S. D. Shibulal", "This is Shibu. So actually let me start with the employer addition part which is in front of me. We have added 8,900 gross employees in Q4, this is above the guidance we gave in the beginning of the Q4 we have guided where 5,800 people addition in the beginning of Q4. And the net addition in Q4 had been 3,041. We are 130,000 people today, next year hiring we are planning to hire 45,000 people next year.", "Now looking at clients. We added 34 new clients in this quarter; the more important thing is that 7 of the new clients we added are Fortune 500. We have a 154 clients out of the Fortune 500 list as of today.", "We have very, very strong client base. Total on \u2013 total number of clients have reached 620, and that also had gone up. 1 million dollar clients last quarter was 350, this quarter is 366, improvement there. Our top 10 clients, given us 24.9% of our revenue. Our repeat business as of Q4 is 97%, which is a very, very strong repeat business with our existing clients.", "From a vertical perspective, manufacturing has gone up quarter-on-quarter, but the more important thing is look at year-on-year numbers year-on-year BFSI has done very well. It has gone up from 34% last year to 35.9% this year. And manufacturing has remained stable and retail has gone up retail has gone up from 13.3% last year to 14.2% this year. So the strong verticals for us BFSI, retail and manufacturing. The weak vertical at this point is telecom because it is going through an investment cycle and the spending in the industry is slow.", "From a geographical split North America has marginally decreased. India has gone up to 2.7% it was 2.2% last quarter. Once again it will be good to look at the yearly numbers. Year-on-year India has gone from 1.2% to 2.2% this year in the FY \u201811. Service footprint consulting is 25.4% year-on-year it has improved by 1% last year it was 24.4% that is FY \u201810 and FY \u201811 it is 25.5%.", "Also system integration work has also improved from 4.2% of our revenue last year to 5.4% of our revenue this year. Fixed price, time and material is stable year-on-year it has gone up again by approximately 1.8 percentage points. It reflects the kind of work which we do more and more transformational work do come under fixed price. Onsite offshore ratio is the, is somewhat similar or marginally changed.", "So with that let me now hand up to Bala for the financial update.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning everyone. This had been a reasonably good quarter, we had done well on the top-line we are within the range what we guided for. We had seen decline in volume growth this quarter, volume declined by 1.4%, the operating income level this quarter, the operating margins 29% compared to 30.2% last quarter, as mainly come down due to drop in utilization. Utilization came down by around three percentage points that had impacted the margin.", "The non-operating income went up during the quarter as compared to last quarter and the taxes also proportionately went up. Today our effective tax rate is close to 27%. The net income level we were at 25.1% as compared to 25% last quarter. For the full year, the operating margins as come down from 30.4 to 29.5 is again basically function of rupee on utilization. The net income level we close the year with close to 25% of net margin.", "We have a hedging cover of close to 620 million at the end of the year; we continue to hedge our exposes for next two quarters at any point of time. We believe the currency market will continue to be volatile and we don\u2019t want to take a long-term view. For next year we have given a guidance of revenue growth between 18% to 20% and EPS guidance of 8% to 10%.", "We are assuming the rupee dollar rate at 44.50 that is what it closed in March to continue for next year which means the appreciation of close to 2%, 2.5% which will impact the operating margin by close to 100 basis points. We\u2019re assuming that we\u2019ll add 45,000 more employees next year and that is on top of lower utilization we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter. So, utilization next year could come down that could impact our operating margins by close to 100 basis points.", "And then we are increasing the wages in India by around 10% to 12% and 2% to 3% outside India that could have a larger impact in the first quarter of next fiscal but overall for the year it could impact the margin by close to 100 basis points. So net-net we\u2019re assuming a 300 basis point drop in operating margin next year for 18% to 20% revenue growth.", "If that revenue growth comes better than what we expected probably some of this impact we could absorb. We\u2019ve seen the similar trend last year and initially when we guided for 17% to 19% growth we had assumed a decline in margin but when the growth came at 26% we\u2019re able to absorb most of this impact.", "So going forward next year the environment continues to be stable and the customer spending happens beyond what we expect probably we\u2019ll be able to absorb some of this impact. We\u2019re going to spend close to 2000 crores of rupees on CapEx next year. We ended the year with the DSO days of 63 days, so I think next year we had given a good revenue guidance. We are assuming certain impact on the operating margins and if the growth comes much better what we expect we will be able to absorb some of this impact. With this I will conclude probably now we can open up the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi. I was wondering could you first talk a little bit about your guidance. I know that it seems like it doesn\u2019t include pricing and it doesn\u2019t include any new large deals given where pricing was this quarter, what was the decision in not including those and maybe just talk about some of the other assumptions in the guidance?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Traditionally we have assumed that the Q4 pricing to continue stable pricing and that\u2019s the same principle that we have used this year also in the model because it\u2019s not completely under our control and that\u2019s the reason why we don\u2019t assume any increase in the revenue productivity we assume that Q4 number and that\u2019s how we do the modeling. Then what is the second question please.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yeah I was just wondering, what are other assumptions are in that guidance as far as the demand backdrop and utilization rates et cetera?", "V. Balakrishnan", "So utilization is typically we assume 78, 79 we have adding significant number of people 45,000 in some sense ahead of the requirement currently the utilization is 75% excluding trainees.", "So you\u2019ve assumed a slightly lower utilization going forward. We have said that we will continue to have excess capacity and that impact is about 1.5% about 150 basis points in the operating margin drop. This is where Bala said that is the growth is higher than 18% to 20%. We should see improvement in margin as we have done this year.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Maybe you could just talk about and it looks like this quarterly numbers where the volumes being down and across the sectors things are a little bit light I know there is some seasonality with the budgets, but maybe you could talk about the short-term outlook versus the long-term outlook and maybe what gives you confidence that work is going to accelerate here in the back half of the year?", "V. Balakrishnan", "In fact in order to give you actually a better prospect I\u2019m going to ask two of my colleagues, Ashok Vemuri who is handling the largest industry vertical BFSI and B. G. Srinivas who handles manufacturing, so two large verticals to give you actually proper prospect is on each of the sectors.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Thanks, this is Ashok. So essentially we are a lot more confident going into the year about a performance and that it will not be reflective of what we did in Q4 because from essentially the pipeline that we have the fact that some of our large transactions spilled over from Q4 into Q1. So those are the once that we will mind in this fiscal year also the fact that we in the last four or five months have opened accounts in geographies that we were not present in especially Continental Europe those are the ones that we will continue to mind.", "We\u2019ve got very good traction on some of our solutions specifically in regulatory compliance area and business intelligence and analytics et cetera. So from where we are sitting coming off a couple of quarters that we had robust growth Q4 was a little soft. I think that has actually something that we expected, but our view is that going in into the fiscal we will have based on the opportunity pipeline that it will be much better than where we are at this point of time.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. I wonder if you could talk is there \u2013 was there anything any large projects that rolled off this quarter anything particularly in the insurance or financial services vertical?", "V. Balakrishnan", "So nothing in the BFSI vertical we don\u2019t have any particular project that have been canceled et cetera. Insurance has been a bit of a laggard over the last couple of quarters but again from where we are seeing it today some of our large transactions that we hope to close very soon are in the insurance space. We have had not such a large footprint in insurance as compared to the rest of BFS and hopefully we are in a place very quickly actually in a place where we can correct that situation.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Ed Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi good evening. Can you talk a little bit about where attrition stands now and where you think employee attrition will go?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Attrition has come down we lost 3,500 people in services in this quarter. And I think that the stability that\u2019s coming to the place. We have announced a compensation hike of 10% to 12% for India, 2% to 3% for overseas people. And I think this year the attrition for the entire industry will be lower because last year the industry opened up there was heavy growth, many people did not have enough people and they went and push from others.", "This year they come to a new normal and the new normal they have hired lot more people last year. They are going to call this and made lot more offers about 140,000 offers for the top five companies if I\u2019m right. And overall people know that they are not going to push as much because they have enough people and I think attrition will be stabilized for the whole year it could be between 12.5% to maybe 13.5%, 14% on a voluntary basis which is very good.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Follow real quick tax rate assumption for FY \u201812?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well the effective tax rate for the full fiscal of 2011 was 27%. I think it will continue to be within the range of 26, 27 even for next year because all the incremental growth could be in SEZ. To an extent that will give some benefit on the tax rates. So I think it will be at the same effective tax rate what you\u2019ve seen in this fiscal.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "On the earlier call there was some discussion about increasing hiring outside of India. I was curious how that was going what the implications are for margins and what fallout you\u2019re having on the lawsuit in Alabama?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Overall we had hired about 1500 about 1000 people in the U.S and 500 outside the U.S. This year also we are planning to hire a similar number or maybe up to 2000 people outside India see the impact on the margin is limited because in many cases these are for higher value added service the revenue productivity is higher. So we are doing this in such a way that the impact on margin is minimal, but that something we have to calibrate as we go long, but the aim or the goal is to minimize them back on margin it\u2019s in line with the our change that is happening in that service lines and things of that.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "And any update on Alabama?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Any \u2013 can you repeat that.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Any update on the lawsuit in Alabama?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, I cannot comment on it we are taking it seriously and working on it that\u2019s all I can say.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Last quick question lot of chatter in the press about changes at the senior management level. Can you update us on what the current status is?", "V. Balakrishnan", "So there are two sets actually one is today Dinesh one of the founders has announced retirement second is Mohandas Pai has announced his, he\u2019s had to explore things outside in terms of education field and things of that now broaden his portfolio and then of course where you have Murthy\u2019s retirement which is coming up in August. So the board is meeting in August, April 20th it\u2019s about 15 days from now and we will announce the succession planning.", "As in the past we have a bench leadership bench and we are confident that we can manage these transitions well there will be continuity. We\u2019ve done it in the past and I\u2019m very confident about the leadership that is there in the company. The second set is changes in management internally and things like that, but here it\u2019s more about aligning our portfolios, so that we can serve our clients better.", "And we have moved in this direction seven, eight years back when we verticalized the North America then we included Europe also and today we\u2019re saying we will be going to market as four large vertical industry groupings and one smaller one the four being BFSI, retail logistics and life sciences manufacturing and energy technology, energy, telecom and Services. And the fifth one which is smaller is public services and healthcare. Many of the horizontal services like infrastructure management; IBS et cetera have reached a size of $300 million plus no critical mass so that we can vertically align those also.", "So within those services we are creating industry groups aligning them with the good market industries and that\u2019s the transformation that is happening internally. We are also creating new engines of growth overall the products and platforms and the innovations which Subhash Dhar will take responsibility. We hope to grow that significantly. We also have cloud, mobility and sustainability a three growth engines which we are creating as business units.", "So they will also contribute to growth over time. So we will continuously do these things such that we create engines of growth we align ourselves to serve our clients better. We look at scale efficiencies we look at leadership development we look at serving our clients better. So this is an ongoing process we hope to complete this part of the transformation also this quarter and we will be then very prepared to manage the growth or handle the growth. We have also launched what we call Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise, Thought Leadership as a solutions program for the company.", "This is to again serve our clients better. We\u2019re looking at where the clients are investing in the future and making sure that all the things that we do all the solutions that we create every project that we execute and some sense are reliant to these themes and we can articulate the value we delivered to the clients better we can serve our clients better, we can create our leadership solutions that are on this things. So these are the changes we believe that this makes Infosys stronger. This makes Infosys better in terms of ability to serve our clients, value addition to clients and things to that.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Caso. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Hey, thanks. Looking at where the revenue mix are expired top one, top five and top ten clients it seems that the weakness was generated from at least maybe one of these top clients maybe one or two. We\u2019ll be correct should that this potential weakness from some of your large as for the unusual weak results that you did pose and BFSI North? Okay.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, Moshe we know that this quarter has some seasonal impact some clients take much longer to start spending after the budgets has set. We knew that and that\u2019s why we had actually projected and muted quarter. There was nothing surprising there is nothing which is going to go forward. This is not actually a change in our client spending or anything to that, they\u2019re just seasonal which some clients have that seasonality built into their spending pattern. So we had anticipated that we knew about and we had anticipated that.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Well close it\u2019s beyond that and what we\u2019re talking about sequentially flat numbers and BFSI sequentially flat numbers in North America. So again I think more color on that, that would be helpful, and then given Mohan\u2019s resignation what is Infosys doing to retain top talent at the company and his condolence could be? Thanks.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, Moshe if you look at the annual numbers for North America for BFSI these are very strong numbers. So there is a seasonality, we\u2019ve had strong quarters in these segments. See North America grew full year by 25%, BFSI grew 42% for the full year. So we\u2019ve strong and we\u2019re confident about our \u2013 our 32% actually BFSI grew 32% for the full year. So we\u2019re confident about these sectors and these will be our intense of growth in the future.", "Now your second part of the question was about ability to retain top talent. Our ability to retain top talent is pretty good, if you look at the leadership pool that we have many of them have spent long years now 10, 12 years with the company. If you look at our Executive Council very long-term within the company, Bala is pointing to himself and he is saying he is there for 20 years now with the company.", "So our ability to retain and there is stability in the team. Now Mohan has been there for 16, 17 years with the company now and as we know he is a person who wants to contribute back to society, he is passionate about certain things in life like education his canvas is much larger he has been significantly contributing to policy and things and then he wants to expand that and that\u2019s the reason he is looking at it and he has been there for 17 years.", "Dinesh is there for 30 years actually and he is one of the co-founders of the company and he has run the marathon with us, we\u2019ve grown the company together with him and he is expressly sad to retire. I don\u2019t think these are normal events are which we can treat them as our inability to retain our leadership talent.", "Murthy retiring he is about age which we had certain things to that. This we have known for quite sometime. So these are unique very, very unique events it\u2019s not about retaining talent leadership talent it is about changes that we have to prepare ourselves and we have to plan ahead and things like that four, five years from now another set of changes would happen in terms of other people retiring.", "So these are things we have to plan ahead we are confident that we have the leadership within the company this leadership is very experienced, this leadership is well known in the industry, this leadership has been meeting you people have been meeting clients, the clients are confident, they are running very large portfolios today. I\u2019m very confident that the company will be in very, very good hands as we proceed forward.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks, Kris.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Kris I guess what stands out is and I know you are the first to report here but your momentum and the business seems to standing contrast to many of your peers and to be fair historically you\u2019ve been able to manage the various headwinds that the businesses stays whether that be wage increases FX attrition et cetera.", "So with that as a backdrop can you help us understand the head count constraints and the impact on growth in the fourth quarter as well as your sequential growth in the first quarter and I guess as well as the impact on margins and then specifically with the lack of capacity the primary issue impacting growth in margin. And do you expect to see a more normal sequential pattern of growth and level of profitability as the year progresses and you start adjusting your capacity?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So David very interesting question. I\u2019ll share our thoughts here. See at the beginning of the year we said that 25,000 people 17% to 19% growth for the year. And we started the year we had very good two quarters and utilization crossed 82% actually the peak was around 82%. And at 82% we knew and we\u2019ve shared this in the past with you that with all of you actually that it will start impacting customer service, our ability to stop projects.", "We also we\u2019re not able to take on some of the projects and things like that. So things started slowing down and it takes actually couple of quarters to gain regain momentum because you don\u2019t overnight get back those deals or replace those deals. That\u2019s a learning and so that is why we said this year let\u2019s be ahead and the numbers are very large. We are now talking about recruiting 10,000 people in a quarter and to bump up 10,000 to 11,000.", "The 1000 is actually a pretty steep target. So you have to plan ahead, you have to could prepare the pipeline to hire 10,000 people typically we have to get 100,000 applications and things like that 1:10 ratio minimum. And so that is why we said let\u2019s shoot for about recruiting 45,000 people. This year we recruited 43, so we have confidence that we can recruit 45,000. This quarter also we said 8,500 people were recruited instead of 5,800. Again it is because we believe that the year is normal and we can grow.", "What is the result of that? There is a slight impact on margin. It\u2019s an investment we are making. We are creating capacity and hoping that when the growth is there when the growth comes our way, we can accelerate growth and we can prepare ourselves better and that will offset or that will actually improve margins at that point. So, that\u2019s the dynamics of this and I hope that explains it.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Well I guess what I\u2019m thinking is if you get to a more steady state I guess model if you will. Should we expect the growth to kind of go back to a mid-single-digit type of sequential growth profile, but at a lower margin or would in fact you see both the margins and the sequential growth rate returned to more historical levels.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So if, so for example if this year we only recruit for the 18% to 20% actually the margin will be better except for the rupee impact fee. Rupee impact is a structural thing and that will have an impact. We have actually taken care of the impact of tax rate and things like that. We\u2019ve now at the 27% effective tax rate. So the rupee is the only structural impact.", "We are investing ahead. So our ability to sustain margins and demonstrated consistently year-after-year even this year, if you actually exclude the rupee impact, but look at the impact on margin. It would have been actually better. The margin would have been improved if it were not for the slight drop in utilization and things like that. But that\u2019s how it is, so if we stop recruiting or reduce the pace of recruiting actually our margin would improve that\u2019s one of the levers now that we have that we can use if need be.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And just one last thing that the local hiring and the investment spending you didn\u2019t talk as much about that I know you mentioned that you made double the local hiring. But you are only at a 1000 people, it sounds like a year. So can you again help us at least better understand what\u2019s going on structurally in the industry and how that may change the requirement for the acceleration of those investments over the next several quarters?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So in our case it\u2019s tied to the service lines in which we are investing, consulting, system integration, the services that are closer to the clients and things like that and they are growing. So as they grow, we need to recruit a lot more people locally, but the revenue productivity is higher and it also generates downstream revenue. So that\u2019s how we are hoping that and we have demonstrated this year now we\u2019ve added one of the largest numbers in our history in terms of hiring outside India. So we are able to do this hiring and maintain margins reasonably well. Of course this is an execution game and we have to continuously execute these things properly. So that this can go on and that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving to do at that point.", "David Grossman \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Grossman. Our next question is from the line of Sanil Daptardar of Sentinel Investments. Please go ahead.", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "Yeah, thanks. In your guidance what were you assuming in terms of the pricing?", "Operator", "Excuse me this is the operator. Sir, are you on a speaker phone?", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "No, I\u2019m not.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Please go ahead.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So for the purpose of guidance we have assumed stable pricing. So the revenue productivity of Q4 is what we have assumed for our guidance.", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "So all the guidance for fiscal \u201812 is basically based on the volume growth that you\u2019re assuming and where is that volume growth you\u2019re seeing in which verticals you\u2019re seeing this trend that you mentioned right now in the conference call although this manufacturing BFSI and retail are going to continue with this trend going forward for the next year you think so?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So it\u2019s all volume growth which we have factored in our guidance because that is our standard process and the revenue productivity improvement is not entirely in our hands. So we don\u2019t factor it in for guidance and future planning at this stage. It goes quarter-after-quarter number one.", "Number two the verticals which where we are seeing where we are seeing traction. Of course BFSI will continue to an important vertical and we believe that this will grow manufacturing retail, energy and utilities is growing faster for us. And healthcare and life science are areas where we are investing, we believe that they will also pick up momentum so other than telecom. Telecom is the only segment where we are seeing weakness and we believe that is because of the investment cycle. So other than telecom most of the other verticals will do very well for us.", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "Okay. Just give me a color on what you \u2013 when you compare 2010 and I think 2010 was a cyclical recovery year. There was aggressive growth out there people had projects that were spent and then the projects we\u2019re spending money. When you look into next two years this year I think you saw a more normal environment that\u2019s what you had commented in your press release and you say it\u2019s a stable environment. When you compare and contrast that with what happened before the financial crisis is the environment what it is now before the financial crisis and going forward do you think that most of the projects are over and the rate of growth is going to slow into fiscal 2013 with the kind of pipeline you\u2019re using?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, to answer the question on the environment, the environment is definitely not exactly same as what it was before the financial crisis. It is not same as what was in the financial crisis but nor is it same as what was before the financial crisis. That kind of stability I don\u2019t think we can hope for at this point in time because of various reasons, you have economic uncertainty, you have currency volatility, you have regulatory volatility going on and clients are dealing with various macro-economic events.", "So what is happening is that the decisions are getting delayed also when they take them they\u2019ve taken on a arrear basis. And so we are getting used to that new normal which is different from what is well in the PAT. That\u2019s part of life we need to get used to that new normal. Now as well as growth is concerned we have given a guidance of 18% to 20% at the same time we are prepared completely prepared to take advantage of any other opportunities which will come during the year that is where the investment for recruitment and the dipping of utilization is planned at the second part.", "Thirdly, when we look at the future what we are trying to focus on is on the client and on the areas in which the clients are trying to achieve certain things right. So it\u2019s all focused on the client Chris talked about it. We have traditionally we are very strong in the operation business operations part. And optimizing that piece that means what you have done in the past is to deliver lot of value due to optimization in the business operations piece.", "Our ability to transform the business is consistently improved today our revenue from consulting some integration kind of work is approximately 25% which is considerably gone up over the last let\u2019s say five to six years. So that is the second piece where we are investing where we are expanding of a addressable market and that is also very relevant to the client.", "The third part is the business innovation piece where the clients want to innovate to take advantage of some of these global plans like digital consumer, sustainability, emerging markets or smarter organization. So what we are seeing is there very good traction with those teams. Our accelerators \u2013 our ability to co-create, our ability to transform are allowing us to address more and more of those markets.", "So, if you look at these, in total we are extremely relevant to the clients in all the three areas where they spend or where their, where their action is, operations and optimization. Second is transformation and third is, business innovations. So we believe that expands our addressable market space that gives us an ability to add value to our clients in all the three areas and drive growth for ourselves.", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "Okay. If I can ask one last question on the deal size as what are you seeing in the marketplace in terms of the deal sizes. I think given last few quarters there had been some mega deals but have those mega deals gone away or it\u2019s still continuing and how you tend to gain more market shares on those deals?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, in the last quarter we have closed four transformational deals and six large out-sourcing deals. And so a pleasant surprise actually the deals which we\u2019ve won were actually larger than the deals which we lost, which means that our average size of the deal which we win are going up which is good news for us. At this point we are chasing deals about 12 deals which are anywhere between $50 million to $250 million. And our win rate is usually one-third approximately one-third. We would like it to be higher and we are working on it, but otherwise it is one-third.", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "Okay.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "And our transformational deal sizes have definitely gone up. It used to be somewhere between $30 million to $50 million. Today we are easily winning $80 million to $100 million.", "Sanil Daptardar \u2013 Sentinel Investments", "Good. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mark Zgutowicz \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi. Thank you. Just may be a clarification from a prior question. I was hoping you could be a little more specific about customer service issues that you encountered last year that and sort of direct to the hiring the levels you\u2019re expecting this year. I\u2019m just curious how much that was volume or attrition related versus just charge of skill-sets and also may be charges geographically and sort of how the hires you plan for this year will alleviate those issues? Thanks.", "V. Balakrishnan", "So, regarding the utilization we talked about our philosophy of the operation is that during the planning stage we do optimized planning which means we will plan for 78% utilization that\u2019s basically I\u2019ve given the guidance of 20% we will plan for 78% and 20%. And during execution we maximize so as and when we find opportunities we will actually take them up even if our utilization goes above 78% it is \u2013 it is not \u2013 we\u2019ve done it many, many times in the past.", "The talent happens if it goes above let\u2019s say about 81% and it remains there for couple of quarters. One quarter 81%, 82% it goes back we had find but if it\u2019s made separate that a longer period of time our ability to take up programs definitely come down because if you are 78% utilization on a 100,000 people base you have 22,000 people on bench but if you have of course please remember lot of it is leave and travel and training and things like that but still at a gross level.", "If you go to 82% you have 18% people on the bench and out of that about 10% almost 10% is about all the leave, travel, training, sabbatical all kinds of other things. So your number of people who are available to start new projects come down, you don\u2019t see an immediate impact because the impact of project start I\u2019ve seen a World Cup about two quarters down the line and that was what Kris was talking about. That is the answer to one question. The second was about hiring, we are planning to hire 45,000 people next year, 6,500 in Q1, our lateral hiring is about let\u2019s say 20% of that approximately. And as Kris said we are planning to hire about 2,000 people outside India 2,000 plus people.", "Mark Zgutowicz \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes guys, thanks for letting me ask another question here. So over the last couple of quarters the volume growth in particular has been softer than what we\u2019ve come to expect particularly in a more normal market environment from the Infosys. So I guess I am wondering I mean over the last couple of quarters the December quarter and the March quarter, do you think you\u2019ve been keeping pace with the offshore markets overall growth rate particularly in the March quarter where your sequential volume growth was actually slightly negative?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So, we cannot at this point speculate because we are one of the first to announce the results but having said that 26% for the year seems to be actually ahead of the overall industry, the industry is expected to grow what was expected to grow at 18%. So, we\u2019re ahead of the industry for the annual growth rate.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Right. But the run rates for the last couple of quarters has dropped. So I mean to the extent that you had some issues in the March quarter related to you might have lost the week of work as budgets transition from one year to the next or some deals that were delayed. Do you expect those to be similar issues that we\u2019ll hear from other offshore players in the upcoming weeks as they release earnings or do you think you might have experienced some client specific issues on your own part that contributed to that?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So we have a seasonality which we had guided also. I do not know about others because others have not as per their results I don\u2019t know.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay. But I mean would you be surprised if the other players have sequential volume growth that\u2019s flat or slightly negative or would you expect that other players would have more positive growth trends. Because it does seem that the offshore market is still on a growth trajectory that\u2019s I mean in the low 20s range from what we can tell. And so I mean either you have been through a low here or the offshore market has experienced some problems. And it looks more like you have been through a low here rather than that the offshore market is experiencing some problems. So, can you give us any perspective on that?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "So if we look at our guidance of 18% to 20% for the next four quarters, we believe that the growth is there for this model growth is there. So there is some seasonality and that\u2019s what is reflected. This is our perspective.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research. Please go ahead", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities", "Thank you. Couple of questions here. If I look at where the industry structure over the last I would say four months or so we\u2019ve seen some changes may not be some significant but it\u2019s definitely pointing to something, we saw MindTree having some issues, we also saw Genpact acquiring Headstrong, we also saw (inaudible) and IGIG. When I look at all these tools is that probably the industry of out-sourcing is getting matured and probably the industry growth of about 18% to 20% that we have resumed may not be right probably it is more around 11% and 13% of the IC.", "Based on less than we have right for the industry growth it\u2019s not 18% to 20% and industry growth is more towards the 10% to 12% or maybe 13%. In that situation first what can Infosys do to outgrow the market? Number two is the growth rate of the industry is nearly 10% to 12% then definitely acquisition should be your top priority and quarterly revenues and cash flows (inaudible) technology. So if suppose I am right whether this change your equation and then I have a follow up question?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Very interesting question. So, again let me give you my perspective actually I would say many of you are probably better positioned to answer this question. If you look at NASSCOM\u2019s projection this year was 18%, we are doing 26%. NASSCOM\u2019s projection for next year is about 16%, 17%, we\u2019ve given a guidance of 18% to 20%. NASSCOM\u2019s guidance our projection for the next ten years through 2020 is the industry would grow around 11% to 13%. So that\u2019s the range of numbers we are talking about. For this year NASSCOM says 16%, 17% we are saying 18%, 20%. Last year NASSCOM said 18, we are saying 26 we have delivered 26. So those are some of the numbers.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities", "Perfect. The question I had was \u2013 if suppose \u2013", "Operator", "Excuse me, this is the operator, sorry to interrupt. Mr. Chowdhry your line is not very clear. If you\u2019re on a speakerphone, please use your handset. Mr. Chowdhry?", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities", "Hello?", "Operator", "Yes. Please go ahead.", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities", "Perfect. The follow-up question I had was regarding \u2013 yeah hello can you hear me? I guess not so. I\u2019ll just pass my second question. Go ahead.", "Operator", "This is the operator. Mr. Chowdhry please go ahead. Okay.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Can we go to the next question?", "Trip Chowdhry \u2013 Global Equities", "Yes, probably that would be better.", "Operator", "So shall we move on to the next question?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yes. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rahul Acharya of the Everest Group. Please go ahead.", "Rahul Acharya \u2013 Everest Group", "Hello, thanks. Last time around we mentioned about investments made around into BFSI about mobile banking, rural banking and investment around that area. So I wanted to get an update of how is that coming along in this particular quarter and any outlook in the next year?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Yeah in fact mobile banking we launched in November in Vegas and RDS and we have already signed up three customers globally. And it\u2019s \u2013 we are seeing very good traction on that and on top-flight we have also been able to do the PoC on the mobile commerce as well which is another offshoot of the whole mobile initiative. This quarter we have made investments in launching Finacle on cloud for a segment called cooperative and community banks. So this is something which we are following through.", "Rahul Acharya \u2013 Everest Group", "Okay. And the energy and utilities vertical products \u2013 investments around Smart Meters and Smart Grid technology?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Pardon?", "Rahul Acharya \u2013 Everest Group", "In the energy and utilities vertical any investments around (inaudible) and smart meter solutions?", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "As in other industry verticals we do invest in creating point of view, creating solutions and things like that. The whole area of sustainability is a very interesting area and we believe that will be an area of growth for the company. So we have created a Center of Excellence around sustainability. And energy and utilities is a growth engine for us and we will continue to invest, we\u2019re looking at smart metering or automated metering. We\u2019re looking at smart grids, we are looking at suitability. So there are lot of opportunities in the area of energy and utilities.", "Rahul Acharya \u2013 Everest Group", "Okay. Thanks so much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Acharya. Ladies and gentlemen due to time constraints that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to the Infosys management team to add closing comments.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Thanks everyone for joining us.", "S. Gopalakrishnan", "Thank you everyone for participating in this call, really appreciate all the questions. Our investment relationship managers are available and you know them. So if you have any further questions they will be able to answer or if you need to talk to anyone of us we are also available, looking forward to interacting with you during the quarter or at the end of next quarter.

As a reminder, for the duration of this conference, all participants\u2019 lines will be in the listen-only mode, and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of the opening remarks. Please note that this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys. Thank you, and over to you Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo \u2013 Investor Relations", "Thanks, (Rochelle). Good morning, everyone and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys earnings release for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York.", "Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and M.D., Mr. Kris Gopalakrishnan; COO, Mr. S. D. Shibulal; and CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management team.", "We\u2019ll start the call with a brief statement of the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed with outlook for the quarter ending September 30 and year ending March 31, 2012. Subsequently, we will open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and the explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019ll now like to pass it on to Mr. S. Gopalakrishnan.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan \u2013 Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director", "Thank you, Sandeep. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening to every one of you. The top headline is we have exceeded the upper end of our guidance. Our guidance for the quarter was $1.643 billion to $1.659 billion. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.671 billion. The revenue grew sequentially by 4.3%. The volumes increased sequentially by 4%, onsite volumes increased by 6.8%. This typically happens when there is an acceleration of growth because most projects start onsite. There is all round good performance by the company. So, revenue per employee increased by 1.2% on blended terms.", "We added about 9,900 employees this quarter. We said we will add 6,500. Because of that, of course, our utilization is slightly lower. Utilization, excluding trainees is 73.3%. Last quarter, it was 73.4%. But given that we want to be prepared to take advantage of growth opportunities that we see. We had decided to actually recruit ahead of demand. And so this was in some sense planned. In fact, we planned to recruit another 12,000 people in the second quarter. We had three large deals closed this quarter, three transformation deals this quarter. We added 26 clients. The top five clients grew at the rate of 8.2% sequentially. We had five platform deals closed this quarter.", "As part of Infy 3.0, product platforms and solutions is a key thrust area for the company. It takes advantage of some of the trends that we see in the market in terms of cloud, mobility etcetera. It takes advantage of emerging engagement models like pay-for-use because most of these are sold as services to our clients, takes advantage of the IT that we develop, sometimes co-create with our clients. So, an inventory of the IT, it shows that we have an increasing portfolio today.", "And lastly, this also is part of our strategy to look at a non-linear growth engine, where the growth happens disproportionate to the number of employees being added, because the traditional model is that growth is proportional to the employee is added. So, this addresses that also. So, it is very strategic for us and I am very happy to report that we have five platform wins in this quarter. Shibu will talk about what some of these platforms are.", "The revenue per file as we move to these kind of solutions are different from our traditional revenue streams because you invest upfront and then you derive revenue on a continuous basis across several quarters. So, your revenue per file is very different. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.67 versus the guidance of $0.63. We\u2019ve exceeded our guidance. We have kept our annual guidance the same 18% to 20% growth. There is a slight improvement in the margin side. We\u2019ve projected a decline of 300 basis points in operating margin, but now we project 2.5% or 250 basis points, a slight improvement on the margin side.", "Given that the environment is uncertain, given that this may impact the timing of decisions being made by our clients, we tell that it is better to be cautious in this environment and that\u2019s why we have not revised our guidance for the entire year at this point, even though we have exceeded our guidance in Q1. So, all-round good performance in the different parameters we used to measure the company. So, I will now pass it on to my colleague S.D. Shibulal to give you more details about the performance in this quarter. Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal \u2013 Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Kris. Let me start with Infosys 3.0. Our strategic direction has been rolled out to the market and we are seeing good traction with our clients. We have identified specific focus areas, which we believe are important to our clients. So, it is all about being relevant to the clients. It is all about being strengthening our strategic partnership with our clients. It is all about operating with them globally. It is also all about being relevant to all their parts of the business, operations part of their business, transformation piece, as well as where they do innovation for their clients or their customers.", "We have realigned our organization completely to our strategic direction. We have created four go-to-market industry verticals. These are global verticals. They will operate globally with our clients. And these are FSI, manufacturing, retail and lifesciences and energy utilities and services. They are headed by people who have been with us for the last many years, who understand the clients as well Infosys very well.", "We have also created three offerings at a very broad level, starting with the first one, business operations, which is application, development and maintenance, infrastructure management, independent validation, and business process management. Mostly the lights-on work which we do with our clients, here our focus will be to build efficiencies to increase productivity, to increase the business value which we deliver to our clients during these engagements. The second large piece will be the consulting and system integration piece. We have created this offering by combining our enterprise solutions, consulting and system integration. That piece gives us 31% of our revenue today. And we are seeing good traction with our clients.", "The third piece is what Kris talked about. It is a new area of focus for us, product platforms and solutions. It also includes the new models of engagement, which we do with our clients. So, on the platform space we have the HRO platform, the B2B platform, iEngage digital marketing. So, out of the five deals, which we\u2019ve got, actually most of them are iEngage deals. There are so different scenarios of iEngage, actually five different scenarios of iEngage, which are already in the market and we are seeing good traction.", "We have multiple models when we want to create this platform, some cases we create our own platforms like Flypp or digital marketing, some cases we build it on other people\u2019s intellectual property like for example iEngage uses one of the other Jive right, when iEngage uses Jive as the basic platform on which we have built it. In other cases like HRO, P2P we are hosting a third-party intellectual property. HRO uses Oracle and P2P uses SAP. So, they are different modules, which we are adapting to deliver this to our clients. These are delivered on pay-per-user. These are delivered on the cloud and it truly converts clients\u2019 fixed cost to variable cost.", "Now let me give you some color on various other parameters this quarter. U.S. has marginally grown ahead of Europe and rest of the world. U.S. revenue this quarter is 64.2%. Our segmentation has changed. Our revenue from business operations is 60% this includes business process management, consulting and systems integration gives 31.8%, product, platform and solutions 8.3%. And actually all the service we have grown this quarter. Business operation by 4%, consulting and systems integration by 4.5%, and product platforms and solutions quarter quarter-on-quarter by 5.3%. Our segmentation in the verticals reflect our go-to-market structures. FSI, which is banking financial services and insurance, was 35.4%. The growth was led by retail, which grew by 10.1% quarter-on-quarter.", "As Kris said, our onsite percentage has marginally gone up, while volume growth is 4% across it was 6.8% onsite. We generally indicate higher levels of project start. We added 26 new clients this quarter, couple of them in the Fortune 500 Global and U.S. Number of clients, number of $1 million clients have gone up to 374. Number of $50 million clients went up from 28 to 34. Growth has been led by the top five this quarter. The top five grew by 8.2% and the non-top five grew by 3.6%. We have a 142 U.S. Global 500 and 154 Global 500 clients working with us.", "With that, let me now hand off to Bala for the financial highlights. Thank you.", "V. Balakrishnan \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Good evening friends. This quarter has come out much better than what we expected in the beginning of the year. The revenues grew by 4.3% and the revenue productivity went up by 1.2%. On constant currency basis, the revenue productivity is almost flat. As you remember, in the beginning of the year, we said the operating margins this quarter could decline by around 4% and for the full year could decline by around 3%, mainly because of one, wage impact in the first quarter. We increased wages in India by around 10% to 12%, onsite by around 2% to 3%. It typically impacts our margins in the first quarter. The first quarter came much better than what we expected. The margins declined only by 3%. The operating margins declined from 29% last quarter to around 26.1% this quarter mainly factoring the wage increases what we have given this quarter.", "The non-operating income is slightly higher in this quarter because the yield has gone up, yield has gone up to around 9.5% and also we had a exchange gain of around $10 million in the non-operating income this quarter, which may not be there next quarter. The effective tax rate is close to 28%. We always said it could be somewhere between 27% to 28%, but it will be closer to 28% and the EPS came much better than what we expected.", "For the next quarter, we are giving a guidance of around 5% growth on the upper end. We are also assuming the operating margins to remain at the same level as Q1, but the non-operating could be lesser because we won\u2019t get the exchange gains of $10 million, what we saw in the first quarter to the extent the net margin could be slightly lesser than the first quarter. And for the full year, we are retaining the guidance at 18% to 20% growth, because we believe the environment is still volatile. Plans are still cautious about the spending. So, it\u2019s too early for us to re-look at the yearly guidance.", "And we also assuming that the operating margins for full year could decline by around 2.5% instead of 3% we predicted in the beginning of this year and 2.5% is basically due to three reasons. One is the currency. The average rupee dollar rate last year was 45.54, this year it could be 44.72, because for rest of the year, they are assuming at 44.50, which means appreciation of around 1.8%, which could impact the margin by around 80 basis points.", "Utilization could come down from 72% to 70%. As we add more people, we are adding 45,000 more people this year and 12,000 in the second quarter that could impact the margin by around 90 basis points and the balance 0.5 is mainly due to salary impact, which is not fully absorbed at the growth level of 18% to 20%.", "The foreign exchange, it has been very volatile this quarter. Almost all the currencies appreciated against US dollar, while the rupee also appreciated against the US dollar. We believe the currency environment will be very volatile. We want to take a short-term view. We are not changing that. We have a total cover of $745 million at the end of Q1. It was $620 million at the end of last fiscal. So, we had increased slightly our hedging position, but we still believe the rupee could depreciate in the short-term.", "We are also assuming that the effective tax rate could be closer to 28% for the full year. The cash position has been extremely good. We have a cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion at the end of this quarter. Our DSO days are 63 days similar to what we have seen last quarter. So, overall I think this quarter has come much better than what we expected in the beginning and the margins for the full year also we believe it will be slightly better than what we predicted in the beginning of the year.", "The revenue productivity, it is stable, because in constant currency terms, we are not seeing any increase in the first quarter and we are assuming it will remain flat for rest of the year. So overall, I think that it turned out better than what we expected, but we are cautious because the economic situation, all the markets we are operating still not recovered and our plans are very cautious.", "With this, I will open up the floor for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi. I was wondering if you could take a little time to maybe frame for us what you are seeing on the demand side that causes the caution. Has there been any cancellations, any push out of projects or just maybe extrapolating what you are seeing on the headlines in the general economy?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "We are not seeing any cancellations. As you can see, our Q1 results show that we have done better than guidance. But given that there is uncertainty about the overall environment, sometimes you can see very short-term delays in decision-making. So, we want to be cautious because of that actually rather than anything specific that we see in our client behavior. So, we are not seeing any cancellations.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "And then \u2013 but it seems like you are taking a longer term approach in the business in general by putting \u2013 by increasing hiring, maybe you can help us reconcile sort of the cautiousness over the short-term versus your increasing of headcount?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, we are definitely taking a very long-term view of the business. We are recruiting ahead of demand. We believe that we need to have a strategic bend, so that if the demand picks up we are in a better position to take advantage of that. The recruiting ahead of demand, so that we can train and prepare this workforce to provide value to our clients, remember that our training is one of the best at the entry level. We train our people for 23 weeks at our corporate education facility, Global Education Center. So, we prepare our people.", "We are also thinking long-term by looking at the needs of our clients. The clients have three sets of needs actually. One to optimize to reduce the cost in business operations and we are trying to add this, that has been our traditional business. Second, we are looking at the need for our clients to transform their business, to grow their business, to become more competitive, the transformation-related services. These are the consulting system integration services. And the third piece is when the clients look at new technologies emerging, new ways of engaging with their service providers may be moving to a platform model, a Cloud-based model. And we are offering those services also today. This actually also helps us to look at nonlinear models of growth. So, we are thinking long-term. We are adding a thought leadership piece to our value addition to our clients. This is the whole thought leadership around building tomorrow\u2019s enterprise.", "Here we look at what are the themes that are emerging? Where are companies spending money today? Where are they looking at new opportunities for transforming their business, to create new revenue engines, sales engines, new markets, and things like that. So, we are definitely thinking long-term. And we are also thinking long-term from a leadership development and leadership bank\u2019s perspective.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "One last question for me, I just want if you could update us on the pricing environment and the general deal size and remind us if what\u2019s built into that revenue growth guidance. And has anything changed on that side?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So even though we have seen a slight uptick this quarter also in terms of revenue per employee, we have assumed flat pricing and we have assumed the same revenue productivity for the rest of the year. So, we have not built in any revenue productivity increase for the rest of the year. It\u2019s the same as Q1. And then what is the second part of your question, sorry?", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yeah. I just wanted to know in general is pricing trending upwards and what is deal size like at this point?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, large deals are back on the table. Even this quarter we have had three large deals, one more than $100 million. So, we see large deals coming back in the strategic global sourcing space as well as in the transformation space.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And is pricing, you are still getting price increases storm upward bias there?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, we have assumed flat revenue per employee. I think the pricing will be stable at this point.", "Joseph Foresi \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies", "Thanks. Hello guys. I just wanted to build on the last question a little bit, just to make sure that everyone is clear as far as what you guys are actually seeing versus what you guys think you may actually start to see at some point in time. And it sounds like what you are saying is that you are not really seeing or actually observing slower client decision-making at this point in time. You are simply incrementally cautious that that dynamic could start to occur on a more prevalent basis over the course of the next quarter and therefore you are taking a more measured view of your September quarter guidance? Is that a fair assessment or are you actually observing a slowdown in client decision-making versus the time of your last earnings call?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "What we are seeing is, maybe it\u2019s temporary, that is for example, what I mean by this is let\u2019s say a deal is supposed to be signed today. The client sees something in the market in the morning when they come in. They may delay actually that decision by two or three weeks till they fully understand the implications of that. The overhang of the global economy is in everybody\u2019s mind today. Are we going to see something dramatic happen suddenly? So, even though we are not seeing a reduction in IT budget for example, we are not seeing a reduction in the IT budget. We believe that the money will be spent, but it may be delayed spending for the year. That is what we are cautious about.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And so, you are a little bit more cautious about that versus how you felt three months ago.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "It\u2019s almost the same. Actually, we said three months ago also that we have to be cautious and we are still saying be cautious and that\u2019s why we have not revised our guidance. Even though our first quarter performance has been better than what we\u2019ve guided.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, okay, understood. The new client adds in the quarter, I know it\u2019s just one-quarter data, you can\u2019t really extrapolate it necessarily, but obviously a bit lower in some recent trends. Do you read that as more of a timing issue or have you see any material change in your win rate in pursuing the customers?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There is no material change in win rates or client additions. Last year we had very, very strong client additions. In fact we added close to 130 clients last year. This quarter we have added 26 clients net eight new clients. There is no secular trend to be taken out of this one-quarter number. I think we need to see \u2013 and also when you 130 new clients and even if the net is 40, there is a lot of mining to be done on those 40 clients. So, we have to balance both, but there is nothing secular which I can say about this quarter\u2019s number.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And just last question from me, your balance sheet obviously remains in a tremendous shape with a terrific flexibility. Has the aperture opened at all in terms of types of acquisitions Infosys might consider just in this organic growth environment or any appetite to do acquisitions larger than what we\u2019ve seen in the past and can you just make some general comments around what your M&A pipeline looks like right now and any changes there?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, we look at M&A from a strategic perspective. We want to add capability. We want to add capability in some of the new areas that we are looking at. So, for example one of the last acquisitions we did was McCamish. It provided us a platform for policy management. We do an extremely small \u2013 it\u2019s a minute acquisition in New Zealand. It opened up the New Zealand market for us. So, we look at acquisitions very strategically, typically smaller acquisitions. We have an active pursuit team in place. They look at maybe 5, 10 companies at any point of time. It doesn\u2019t mean that all or any of them will close, actually, because that we have a pursuit team, as and when we see opportunities, as and when we see a company that wants to be part of Infosys. We are looking at friendly acquisitions. So, once we thought it\u2019s a strategic fit, we feel that we can leverage that, then you will see us make an acquisition.", "Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. Thanks guys for the comments.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Kupferberg. Our next question is from the line of Nabil Elsheshai of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess to followup on the macro questions and specifically on the Financial Services in the US. There is a lot of headlines about cut backs and word going around of them under spending their IT budget. So, could you give a little color on what you are seeing in that vertical, particularly since it\u2019s little bit less than the company overall in this quarter.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yeah, so, Financial Services actually grew about 3.3% this quarter. But, if you break down that into various components, our capital markets business, which is a fairly large chunk of our overall Financial Services, grew about 5.5%. Our banking business on the services side grew about 5.2% and insurance, which has been fairly muted in the past couple of quarters also showed fairly robust growth. We obviously lost out in terms of some amount of discretionary spend delays, Kris was alluded to earlier on, not cancellations, but some delays which did not allow us to capture that revenue in the first quarter. By having said that, I think what we are seeing in the Financial Services space is increased spending in the compliance and regulatory space, significant amount of interest and traction for our products platforms and services space, especially in the area of analytics, mobility and securities trading and processing, etcetera.", "We, at the same time, are hearing increasing concerns or commentary from our clients, let me put it that way about sovereign risk issues of the fact that because of increased requirements for capital that is associated cost will trickle down, nothing that we can put a finger on today, but could trickle down to impact IT budgets, but nothing that we \u2013 as I said earlier, we can put a finger on.", "So, I mean, overall, I would therefore say that the news on the Financial Services notwithstanding a fairly positive performance in the first quarter is a mixed bag. We have had no cancellations. We have had one large deal of the three that Shibu was mentioning in Financial Services. We have seen fairly significant growth in the non-U.S. and non-European markets, that\u2019s essentially, Australia. We see good traction in the Asian markets. And we continue to see strong demand for our business operation services in the Financial Services space in the U.S.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "So, given what you had mentioned in terms of the regulatory constraints, what have you \u2013 I mean, you are closer toward the math. So I mean what are you assuming for the second half from IT spending, are you expecting them to pullback a little bit?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Well, we do expect some pullback in some of the areas that we are engaged with, but that would be compensated, we believe given the commentary and the traction that we have in areas like regulatory and compliance. And these two specifically we have seen very good traction. Also in wealth management space, we are seeing very good traction due to some of the regulatory changes, process and systems changes in the cards business. So, at this point in time, I don\u2019t think it would be \u2013 we would call that we would see a deterioration in either spend, but this is a space that we are going to watch very, very closely.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. Last question on the regulatory, is that a result of Dodd-Frank or is it related to how it impacts (albeit) from that?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Some multiple things, Dodd-Frank, which got delayed, so lot of preparatory work on Dodd-Frank. We are seeing work as a result of, for example Volcker rule so operating going away to wealth management investment. We are seeing rule from a compliance perspective, just basic, we are doing projects, for example, on taxonomy. We are doing projects and programs on just compliance reporting, both in and audit service. So, the whole slew of work that\u2019s actually coming in. And our expectation is that last two years or about 18 months, we made significant revenue on the M&A part of the business. And as that is tapering off, we think that this is the one that would actually replace it. And from our estimates and from our conversations with the clients, we actually expect to see at least two or three times increase in spend in this particular space as compared to what we saw in the M&A space.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay, great. Just real quick on the service lines, this SI work is particularly strong, maybe a little less in the packaged implementation. So, in terms of kind of new application plus development and implementation, what are you seeing going forward there in terms of your customers\u2019 appetite for investments and kind of discretionary application expansion?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, application development is approximately 16% of our revenue. And our consulting system integration side is about 31%. Yeah, I think clients are more and more deciding towards package solutions rather than developing Greenfield applications, but there are occasions where they do decide on a Greenfield application, and that is what you see in the application development space. We are seeing traction in application development space, but you can clearly see that our revenue from consulting and system integration, which includes the package implementation space, has grown faster than the application development space over the last many quarters.", "Nabil Elsheshai \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you, guys for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Elsheshai. Our next question is from the line of George Price of BB&T. Please go ahead.", "George Price \u2013 BB&T", "Hi. Thanks very much. I guess I just wanted to kind of clarify your response to the question before just kind of understand, where your general sense of mindset is that, back to Jason\u2019s question, when you said you are basically \u2013 your view on the broader demand kind of what\u2019s happening on there. Basically the same in terms of caution it was three months ago, but as I recall last quarter you said you were looking fiscal \u201812 be more of a \u201cnormal year\u201d and clearly that doesn\u2019t seen like what\u2019s you are saying right now. That it seems to imply that there is some more fundamental change in the market during the quarter and I guess I would like to hear a little bit more about, it\u2019s a very temporary delay basis, that could we see something, you know, more fundamental happenings here in the demand environment in terms of what\u2019s going on, if I could get your views on that?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "From an IT budget perspective we have seen no change. IT budgets, where up by about 3%, 4% and that\u2019s why we said normal year and the IT budgets continue to be the same. There is no reduction in IT budgets that we can see. But given the overall economic environment and remember that we are now at least some analysts are even talking about double-dip in certain economies. We believe that if something were to happen there maybe a pullback, there maybe. We are not seeing any at this point, but there maybe pullback and that is the reason why we want to be cautious. Now the way it is being reflected is sometimes a temporary delay in decision making that is what we are seeing on the ground right now. No cuts in budgets. No cancellation of project. But we want to be cautious that\u2019s all we are saying.", "George Price \u2013 BB&T", "Okay. And I guess can you just be maybe specific as possible in terms of two things, one with the delays that you are seeing, when do these start to become apparent? What\u2019s the major driver that started off these delays and then related to that, what portion of things that you have seen delayed have since been restarted I mean I guess in another word to say, what\u2019s kind of visibility do you have that these things when they get started up again shortly?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, these delays are temporary in nature. So, for example the deal, which is supposed to close last quarter, may close this quarter actually. It\u2019s a temporary delay. It\u2019s just not anything more specific than that. It is not attributable to any one thing. Something happens in the environment, which raises a concern suddenly a decision is taken to be cautious. That\u2019s it. So, there is nothing specific I can point to. These are temporary delays we see occasionally in decision making.", "George Price \u2013 BB&T", "Okay. Just to be clear have you seen are these delays still I guess occurring or these things started up again. So, you just basically assuming a push out of be it a month or whatever, which is actually maybe these initiates that again started so you are just going to see that move to revenue, when you are cautious to make sure that, you don\u2019t see that again or are you still waiting for the majority of these initiatives that have been delayed to actually start up. You are hoping that this start surely, that\u2019s the clients telling you. But you don\u2019t have concrete visibility on that at this point?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "There is nothing is permanent. So, it just is a delay for a week, two weeks, sometimes. So, these are not permanent. We are not waiting for something to close within an uncertainty. If the clients say, yes everything is fine, but I will sign next week. That\u2019s the kind of thing, nothing more alarming than that at this point.", "George Price \u2013 BB&T", "Okay. And again when did these really start to become apparent?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "During the course of Q1 that\u2019s it, on the last three months. Especially when the Greece situation happened, that\u2019s when we saw concerns and even in the financial services actually. Ashok mentioned this actually. So, that happens suddenly there maybe a week or two of delay before they asses the situation or see whether it\u2019s going to deteriorate further or for example, when France decided to actually renegotiate the loans outstanding. There is a temporary feeling of normalcy coming back right. So, those are the things I\u2019m talking about.", "George Price \u2013 BB&T", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Price. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Thanks. Top one customer was sequentially flat excluding the impact from that top one customer about sequentially revenues were up 5% for the quarter. Couple of things, one can you give us some details on what happened there that\u2019s number one. Number two, should we assume that the weakness from the top one client also had impacted the sequential growth coming out of Europe. And then final question that\u2019s related to the final few questions that came onboard is, whether you see some of the delays towards the end of the quarter specifically during the month of June? Thanks.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "See there is nothing particular in the top one client. Quarter upon quarter some clients grow, some clients don\u2019t grow. So, there is nothing particular I can talk about in the top one client. This is the quarter, where there is not much change in the top one client that\u2019s all Moshe.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay. Did that impact European sequential growth? Was that one of the issues why sequentially Europe was up, but slower pace in the overall company rate?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "No, Europe in generally is flat for us because I see the impact of whatever is happened in the global economy being felt in Europe more than anywhere else actually. So, our strategy in Europe has been to broaden our client base. So, we are practically investing in France, Germany. We are having sales capacity on the ground adding more clients and things to that. So, Europe is slower to recover and is more concerned about whatever is happening in the European region than other regions. We do have (inaudible) issues, but they are actually turning around in Europe.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Going back to your revenue concentration question, you had that uneven performance coming in from your top five and top 10 customers and top one customer during the past quarters and see that has been impacting your sequential growth as a whole. I think it will be beneficially if you kind of give us an update on what\u2019s going on with your top five or top 10 clients. Again top one customer 5% or 11% sequentially flat had pretty significant impact on sequential growth in your company?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "In this quarter the top five clients grew 8.2% much faster than the company average. So, we have seen the top five clients grow faster this quarter. Top five clients are across industries. It just not all one industry and I can\u2019t be more specific than reading our client names Moshe, which I don\u2019t want to do.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Understood and telecom down 7% is that attributable also to one or two customers or this is a cross currency, you have across the board weakness?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Telecom is customer related, plus in telecom we have been primarily in wireline side of the business rather than wireless. So, we are now proactively moving in to wireless and cable, that\u2019s where the investment is going. And so, proactively we are actually focusing more on the wireless and cable. And we have added clients. We have added business in that space and hopefully we will see now growth come back into telecom space also because of the shift in focus to wireless and cable.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "All right, and should we assume that the deferrals that you spoke about started taking place during the month of June. This is when some of the negative economic data started coming out, I mean spook in the markets.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Yes, that is also part of what is happening. Yes.", "Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. There is definitely some evidence that there are increased obstacles for getting U.S. visas approved and I know NASSCOM is also trying to address this issue with the U.S. So, can you give us any update on how many additional U.S. visas you've been able to secure in the last month or during the June quarter, or any sort of general update on how that U.S. visa approval process is going for the company?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "No, I cannot certainly give you those details. All I can say is that this quarter we grew. So, we are able to grow the business in this environment.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. And can you give us any outlook in the U.S. visa approval process, I mean to the extent that you agree that the approval process has become tougher, rejection rates are higher and information request has been up and so on. I mean do you expect that to be resolved over the next several months or could this be an ongoing issue from what you can tell so far?", "V. Balakrishnan", "NASSCOM which is a industry body necessarily talked about higher degree of rejection for the industry. They also talked about delays in getting visas for some of the companies. I think large companies like us who have credibility, we\u2019re able to get our visas. We have enough visas in the system. We also plan in advance and make sure we get visas on time, so it doesn\u2019t hurt us our business. So, we are not seeing any material disruption on the visa front, which will affect our business plans.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. So, when your inventory of visas you have enough of the right visas for the right types of skillsets, so that cannot be a disruption any time soon. Is that the way to look at it?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, we plan in advance. We make sure we have the visas for the right skill of people that it doesn\u2019t impact our business.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. And then are you continuing down the path of, I know you talked about on the last couple of conference calls your desire to lower utilization to prepare for the upcoming growth that you expect to improve. We had a lot of discussions in this conference call where people are asking about sort of demand weakening. But it seems like the strategy is to lower utilization to get ready for better growth. So, is that strategy still fully in tact to try to drop utilizations to get ready for better growth that apparently has been signaled in your pipeline?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Let\u2019s look at it as the clients\u2019 budgets are still firm. I don\u2019t think anybody cut down their budgets. So, budget looks good. So, our strategy is to make sure we have enough capacity in the system. So, we are still growing ahead with the early hiring plan of 45,000 gross additions for the year. So, that could naturally impact the utilization if the growth is only what we are projecting for, that is 18% to 20%. So, we are keeping the model ready. The budget looks good, the environment stable, clients could possibly spend the budgets. That could give us incremental growth. So, we are hiring those people, creating the capacity and keeping the model ready for growth.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Right. So, you\u2019re saying you haven\u2019t changed your, lower your \u2013 you haven\u2019t changed the plan to lower your utilization over the last three months.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yeah, the utilization could naturally be lower if the growth doesn\u2019t come. But if the growth comes, utilization will look up.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Bourgeois. Our next question is from the line of David Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.", "David Koning \u2013 Baird", "Yeah, hey, guys. I was just wondering if we could talk just a little bit about the margins again and I know you improved your margin forecast to down 250 basis points this year. I\u2019m just wondering if you consider this year kind of a one-time step down in margin given a few different items that you mentioned before or if you feel like the wage pressures et cetera might contribute to a longer-term pattern of margin decline. If you are not able to leverage some utilization or currency continues to be a headwind, maybe you could just talk through, whether it does feel like a one-time or maybe more of an ongoing?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, the way to look at it as two things. One is the currency, which is external growth. The currency moved quite faster in a very short timeframe, you can't do much. It could hurt our margins. But if gradually appreciates over a period of time probably you can pull in some of the levers to offset the impact.", "The other two, the utilization and also the wages is more internal to us. If the growth comes better than what we expect, I think growth is the biggest lever we have and if the growth comes better than what we expect, probably some of its impact we could absorb. So, the way to look at it is, we are in an industry with a lot of opportunities for growth. Of course, we will be subject to economic cycles, sometimes it could hurt our growth.", "But if you're taking a long-term view and where growth opportunities are possible, some of the internal things like the wages, and also the utilization can be taken care of. The external thing as I said, the currency, as long as a moment is over a period of time we will be able to absorb, but in a short period of time it could impact us.", "David Koning \u2013 Baird", "Great, thanks and then just a couple of quick modeling questions as well. The other income line, I think you mentioned $10 million of Fx gains in there. So, is the best way to think about that going forward just to take for next quarter, are we just to take $10 million out sequentially?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Can you please repeat, I've not got your question?", "David Koning \u2013 Baird", "I think, within the other income line, it was higher than the spend, in the last several quarters it was $99 million, and I think in the prepared remarks you said $10 million of that was from FX gains, I believe something around that. So, is the best way to think about that in next quarter just to take $10 million out of the Q1 number?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes. Naturally, the yield has gone up this quarter. It was around 9.5%, but I think in the next few quarters, probably the interest rate in India could moderate. So, for the guidance purpose, we assume that the yields could make easier a little bit maybe somewhere between 8.5% to 9% for the rest of the year. So, I think naturally the other income will proportionately come down. The first quarter we had a $10 million positive impact, because of the movement in currency in the non-operating income. That naturally will not be there for rest of the three quarters.", "David Koning \u2013 Baird", "Great. And then just finally the tax rate, you said I think, you might have been in your first call this morning, you said it was going to be about 28% this year. Is that sustainable at 28% or was there something one-time in nature that pushing it higher this year that might subside in the next couple of years?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, there is no one-time in that impact. Even last year, we had a small proportion of revenues coming from our Software Technology Park unit, there is only unit. That also has gone out of tax holiday this year. So, I think we always said it could be somewhere between 27% to 28% and it could be closer to 28% that is what we have seen in the first quarter.", "David Koning \u2013 Baird", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Koning. Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good evening. I want to ask a little bit about the labor market, particularly in India, it looks like your attrition is starting to come under control. Is that effort on your part or is it also sort of the market kind of settling out at this point. And do you sense that there might be needs for interim compensation adjustments as we might have seen in the last 18 months or so or are we sort of beyond that now?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "No, I don't expect any interim comp increase is necessary. I think there is enough supply attrition has come down. The blip we saw was when growth accelerated, everybody is scrambling for resources. We had done long-term planning and so we were probably more of a target. We were not scrambling, because we had actually continuously recruited during the downturn, but things are stabilizing and our own attrition is also coming down. Our comp increase is behind us. So, this is the quarter and it impacted us and it is already behind us.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Can you talk a little bit about your win rates and your trends? I think you talked about slippage within the quarter, but how sort of over, say, a year or two timeframe, could you talk about your win rates and maybe your pipeline trends?", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "So, let me request my colleague Pravin. Retail is one of the fastest growing segments and our win rates there is very strong there and I\u2019ll also ask Prasad who heads our energy utilities, communications, services group actually to talk to about win rates in the ECS segment. Pravin?", "Pravin Rao", "Hello. In the retail space we are seeing lot of traction in the transformation, consulting and system integration space. So, our win rate is anywhere upward 60% to 70%. We have this win rate over the last couple of quarters and the kind of growth we are seeing this quarter is currently because of many deals that we have won in the last couple of quarters. We continue to see a healthy pipeline in this space and we are also having two or three large deals in the pipeline, which we expect to close sometime towards the end of quarter two. So, the overall pipeline is fairly good, mostly around transformation, mostly around platforms, consulting and system integration and about 60% to 70% conversion.", "Kris Gopalakrishnan", "Prasad?", "Prasad Thrikutam", "Hi, this is Prasad. Yeah, let me comment about the energy, utilities and services sector. Q1 if you take the communications part of the energy, utilities and services-", "Operator", "I'm sorry to interrupt. May we request the current speaker to move closer to the microphone please.", "Prasad Thrikutam", "Can you hear me now?", "Operator", "Yes, please go ahead.", "Prasad Thrikutam", "Yeah, so let me repeat what I said. I\u2019m going to comment on how energy, utilities and services performed last quarter. We grew 7.6% quarter-on-quarter and this is on the basis of strong pipeline. We had good conversions in Q1. We\u2019re continuing the momentum. And the pipeline continues to look healthy. There are transformation deals involving package implementations, involving a very deep domain consulting capabilities that, for example, enhances hydrocarbon accounting capabilities of our oil companies, our smartgrid for our utility companies, etcetera. So, the pipeline is strong, the outlook is pretty good in this sector.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yes, my last question is, are the management changes at this point pretty well baked in and what\u2019s your view on replacing the COO role?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, the management changes are fully done. We have the realignment completed. The business operations space is completely done. 55,000 peoples are realigned without looking at date. The consulting and system integration space realignment is going on. It is also almost done. It will be finished by the end of this month. And there will be some residual work, which we need to do next month. So, before the end of next month, definitely we would have completed the full realignment.", "The four industry vertical heads are in place. Two operating heads are in place and we have a new person looking after sales at the corporate level. We have one slot to be filled which is the Corporate Head for products and platforms. We have the process in progress.", "As far as the COO position is concerned, I think given the changes we have made, we will wait for a while before we look at that. We will look at assigning somebody as a COO.", "Edward Caso \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Caso. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo to add closing comments. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Mahindroo \u2013 Investor Relations", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again during the course of the quarter. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Mahindroo. Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of Infosys that concludes this conference call.

Thank you, and over to you Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Rochelle. A very warm welcome to everyone on this call to discuss Infosys earnings release for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. I\u2019m Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this conference call is CEO and M.D., Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. V.

Subsequently, we will open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019ll now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S.D. Shibulal", "Thank you. This is Shibu. I will give you a color on the quarter performance and then give it to Bala for more details on the numbers. We have seen overall growth in Q2. We have delivered $1.746 billion in revenue which is 4.5% growth in reported currency and 5% growth in constant currency. Actually in rupee terms we have grown 8.2%, volume growth is 4.5%. Pricing, blended pricing has gone by 0.5% and the utilization is at 78%. Margins have improved and we have added 1.9% to the margin, 26.1% to 28%, at the operating margin.", "Overall client additions have been very strong this quarter, 45 new clients. 19 of them in our new investment areas which is in utilities, life science, healthcare. Million dollar clients have 388 and our repeat business is 98.5% this quarter.", "Now let me give you some color on our strategic direction and our new organization structure. We have seen very good traction for Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise. Clients are acknowledging that this is very relevant to them. They are acknowledging that it is through thought leadership in the teams which we have chosen. We are wining deals in those teams. We have closed a deal in the Smarter Organizations team with a European client in transforming them from a country focused to a client centric approach. From a country centric approach to a client centric approach and build their next generation organization.", "We are working on another deal in creating new consumer experience in the store with a major retailer, that\u2019s it\u2019s in the digital consumer space. And in the emerging market space we are working with a client in creating engineering innovation in the emerging markets. So these are examples of opportunities and deals which we are seeing in our Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise teams.", "As far as Infosys 3.0 concerned, we have completed the realignment. We have reorganized 100,000 people. We have four major go to market verticals. We of course have Finacle, BPO and the Engineering service. We have new leadership, new executive council in place and new sectors in place, which will allow us to move towards our aspirations.", "We are also investing in new areas. We have new units for enterprise mobility, sustainability and cloud. Those units are also seeing good traction. Our products and platform strategy is planning out well. We have launched Infosys Edge, which is a Infosys family of platforms. Nine of them. We have 20 clients operating on them, we have 10 new clients this quarter. $200 million in TCB closed. Good traction in that direction.", "Consulting and system integration is doing well for us, 31% of our revenue. It has grown quarter-on-quarter and we are seeing -- we are at this point -- our pipeline for transformational programs is 27 at this point. We have been recognized with the industry and by our partners. We are rated in the leadership quadrant by Gartner and Forrester. We received the Titan award, 3rd year in a row at -- Oracle Titan award, 3rd year in a row. We are rated number 15 in the most innovative company list in the world by Forbes. So we are recognized by the industry and our partners.", "With that let me now hand it out to Bala to give you more color and more numbers.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning. In the beginning of the quarter we said our revenue could grow somewhere between 3.5% to 5%. We had actually grown at 4.5%, adjusted for cross currency. In constant currency terms we had grown at 5%, that has come out what he had planned. If you look at the gross margin, the gross margin went up 38.8% last quarter to 41.3%, mainly tracking the movement in the currency. Our operating margin went up by 1.9% and there is a beneficial impact of 1.5% due to rupee-dollar movement. Rupee depreciated against the dollar by 3.4%, so it had positive impact of 1.5% on the margin.", "Utilization went up by 1%, so it contributed another 40 basis points. So net-net the operating margin went up by 1.9%. On the non-operating income side we had $90 million of tertiary income. We had a $6 million negative impact because of currency because when we do hedges, when the currency moves in either direction we\u2019ll have some impact on the non-operating income. So there was a $6 million impact because of the currency on non-operating side.", "Our effective tax rate, slightly gone up during the quarter. It is around 28.6% for the quarter, it was 28.1% for the last quarter. Today we get around 29% of the revenues in SEZ. If you look at revenue growth this quarter, it has been all round growth. Our top client grew by 6.6%. Top 25 clients grew by 7.1%. We added 15,350 employees. Our guidance was 12,000 for the quarter.", "So I think we had seen good revenue traction and the currency movement to some extent helped us to better our margins. So quarter has come out well. Going forward for the full year, earlier we had given a guidance of 18% to 20% growth in revenues. Now, if you re-cast it for the movement in cross currency, our new guidance is at 17.1% to 19.1%. So the assumption on volume growth, pricing growth remains same. The change in guidance is purely because of the cross currency movement.", "And for the full year, in the beginning of the year we said our operating margin could decline by 3-percentage point. In the last quarter we said it could decline by 2.5 percentage point. Now we are talking about somewhere between 50 to 100 basis point decline because the rupee has depreciated against the dollar and if you take the average rate for the full year, I think we will get a beneficial impact of around 1.5% on the margin. Of course utilization will have a negative impact on the margin but because of the currency movement, I think our overall operating margin for the full year could decline only within a range of 50 to 100 basis points.", "So I think we had done well this quarter and we are maintaining our guidance. For the third quarter we are talking about a growth of 3.2% to 5.4%. That is based on the visibility we see in the marketplace today. As we said earlier, this year our growth could be evenly spread out across the four quarters. Typically, in a normal year we could see the growth coming in the first two quarters and third fourth quarters are always soft quarters. But this year probably it will be evenly spread out across all the four quarters.", "With this I will conclude. We will now open it for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies", "Thanks. I appreciate the time. I wanted to just ask a question, as we start to look out the back half of your fiscal year, it looks like the implied sequential revenue growth guidance for the March quarter is roughly 4%, I believe at the mid-point. And I wanted to know if the accounts for any potential delays at the start of the new calendar year in terms of new projects getting ramped up or does it assume a more normal start to the New Year. And as part of that if you can just talk about what you have been seeing most recently in terms of any changes in client decision making patterns? It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s been anything severe in that front despite the macro environment but would love some color there. Thank you.", "S.D. Shibulal", "So our guidance is a statement of fact as we see it today. We look at what we see today, our pipeline, booked revenue, our clients. What we are seeing with the client base and that\u2019s how we come up with the guidance. And as I said it\u2019s a statement of fact as we see it today. Your numbers are accurate in the mid-point it will be 4% numbers and that is based on what we see today.", "From an environmental perspective we are definitely -- we need to be very cautious. We are seeing challenges in Europe, in U.S. There is unemployment, there is economic uncertainty. Financial industry is going through challenges. The Euro Zone is turbulent. There are multiple scenarios which people are talking about. So the environment is definitely challenging for our clients and for ourselves. There is currency uncertainty, currency volatility, regulatory volatility. So we are very cautious. We need to remain cautious.", "And at the same time, if you look at our strategic direction of Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise and Infosys 3.0, it is all about strengthening our strategic partnerships. It is about increasing relevancy for our clients. It is about operating globally for our clients. It is about aligning in front of our clients as one Infy. So we believe that these strategic directions and these steps which we have taken should stand up in good terms in the medium to long term. But that short-term we can be impacted by the environment because we are in an eco-system and the eco-system is definitely undergoing -- is faced with challenges.", "Last point, we are seeing delays in decision making and higher scrutiny of larger investments. We are not seeing project cancelations or program cancelations at this point in time. We are not seeing budget cuts for the current year. Next year budgets are yet to be finalized and we will only know it by the end of this year of Jan.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-on to that, can you clarify, are you more cautious on the demand environment now then you were during your last earnings call and you may have just covered this at the end of your last answer but I couldn\u2019t exactly hear, but with regard to the \u2018012 budgets we have started to hear that in some cases there are some signs of potential delay in budget setting processes. Are you picking that up as well?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, we are always cautious. If you look at our commentary for the last two quarters we are one of the very few in the industry talking about all the macro challenges and what impact it could have on our revenues. But the whole global economic environment is evolving. It is only getting worse every day. But having said that, as Shibu said, we have not seen any project cancelations. We are not seeing any plans changing the budgets or reducing the budget. So clients are spending money. They are cautious and we are also cautious on the macro-economic environment. I don\u2019t think we are seeing any drastic change in client spending behavior from what we saw last quarter, but definitely the evolving economic environment is a concern for us and we are watching it closely.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies", "Okay. That makes sense. And just last one for me, just on the supply side. I think you are still planning to hire 45,000 folks this year, if I am not mistaken. Can you remind of how many of those will be freshers and just any commentary you can provide in terms of quality among the campus talent pool in India that you look to recruit. Has there been any changes there? Any incremental challenges on the hiring front? Thank you.", "S.D. Shibulal", "So we are hiring 45,000 people this year. It will be probably a 70:30 split. 70% from campus and 30% from laterals. We have given 23,000 offers in the campus for people to join next year. This quarter we added 15,000 people gross and 8000 people net. Next quarter we will be adding 8000 people. The quality of talent remains as a concern. While India produces 700,000 engineers, we need to do a lot of effort in making them industry ready or multinational ready. And that is where our investments in Mysore, where we have the global education center. With 14,000 people residential capacity helps us in creating the talent and taking the talent to the next level.", "We believe for the industry in the long term, recruiting very large number of highly talented individuals will be a challenge. And again that is where our strategic direction of Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise with the products and platform play as well as the consulting system integration revenue, consulting system integration space, should give us some relief in the linearity.", "Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi, my first question here is just -- you mentioned some delays, I wonder if you could point to where your biggest areas of concern are, right now on the delay front. Maybe you could just talk about geographies or services?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, actually, there is really no difference between U.S. and Europe in the decision making delays. We are seeing it in both parts of the world. And these are delays in decision making because the clients are uncertain about their future or uncertain about their environment. As I said multi-year programs go under a lot more scrutiny than before. And of course that delays them also, those decision making gets delayed. At the same time clients are looking for better business value. They are looking for better solutions. They are looking for efficiency in operations. That is where our business operation service makes perfect sense because we are driving business where we are delivering business value as well as higher productivity in those service lines.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "The potential delays on discretionary spending and new business awards in existing projects, I am just trying to get a full color for it.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So existing projects are running as usual. We are not seeing project cancellations. There is no question of a delay in an existing program for most part because once it is committed -- in fact once it is committed they want to accelerate it. So that it can be done. So this is not about existing programs or projects. It\u2019s about new programs and project awards.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And if I look at the growth rates this year, they seem to be sort of smoothed out. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what causes the sequential growth to be a little less lumpy than past years. Are you seeing -- was there a delay in the start-up projects at the beginning of the year? How should we think about it because traditionally I think December started to slow and then March of course is the decision making process?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So this is an unusual year because of all the environmental issues. Clients are investing in the short-term but not taking decisions on the long-term ones or taking more time to do it. So that is why in the beginning of the year itself we were saying that it will be evenly paced growth rather than a cyclical growth which we have seen in the past, and that is what we expect at this point in time.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Just one last quick question. Just if you can give us a little color on the pricing environment as it is now and what your expectations are going forward? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "We expect the pricing to be stable. We have seen 0.5% increase in the blended pricing this quarter. 1.3% down on-site and 3.1%, up offshore. We expect the pricing to be stable at this point.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Yeah, thanks. Shibu, going back to discussion over calendar year 2012 budget, when do, in our view, do we get visibility on this budget? Should we assume that budgets get finalized in the January, February timeframe rather than in December?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I would expect the budgets to get finalized in December-January timeframe. Because see while there are environmental factors, corporations have gotten used to operating in this environment. They understand that they need to close it sooner than later. So, I expect that it will close by end of Jan.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "So we\u2019re talking about maybe a slight push out, but not a big one at this point?", "S. D. Shibulal", "At this point, we\u2019re not. At least my judgment and my team\u2019s judgment we feel that it will be mostly January end.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Understood. And then you had a nice sequential uptick in Europe and BFSI, this is in constant currency. Can we get details on the main drivers for these improvements? And in this context maybe you can specifically comment on clients buying behavior in Europe and BFSI? What are they buying? What are they funding in this environment?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me ask BG to give you some color on Europe followed by Ashok to give you some color on the BFSI space?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Hi. In the last quarter, we have added 10 new clients in Europe, and this cuts across the various key industry verticals we focus on including FSI, manufacturing, energy utilities, retail and pharma. So, we have had a pretty good client acquisition in a challenging environment in Europe. Our focus and strategies with respect to both building local capability in Europe, understanding and making sure we are very relevant in the client context with respect to the solutions we bring to bear. And also in each of the countries where we\u2019re clearly focused on building local capability has helped us acquire clients. We continue to expand business within our existing client footprint.", "We have also had in the last six months several co-creation workshops on our Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise brand promise. And in that context we have actually engaged with few of our key clients on actually shaping a client\u2019s destiny in terms of reshaping their internal operations, helping them improve. And we have had some two transformation -- business transformational wins. The business is usual in terms of outsourcing deals. We are not seeing too many of them but there are few deals in the pipeline. This is in financial services, pharma, energy utilities.", "So, in spite of the macro-environment, we are seeing a relatively stable environment within our client businesses. While the decision making is relatively slower, but decisions are being made, investments are being made at this point in time. We have so far not seen any project cancellations or withdrawal of budgets and then that is something we see continuing for this quarter.", "However, we are cautious. The budgets which will get cast for the coming fiscal year in the month of Jan, will let us know how the next fiscal year is going to shape up. But we\u2019re well positioned both in the UK and in the Continental market in terms of our local capability. And we are hopeful that if the Euro Zone holds and there is no real panic, while we will see in the short-term to medium-term the fact that there will be slow demand, we should still be able to leverage our growth in the current market environment. Ashok, you would like add something on the financial services?", "Ashok Vemuri", "Sure. Thanks, B.G. I think from the financial BFSI perspective if you look at our numbers, we have done about 4.5% growth this quarter. Of that, the professional services has grown about 8.5% quarter-on-quarter. So this is coming on the back of two very strong quarter growths that we\u2019ve already had. In terms of a geographical distribution, BFSI has -- about 20% of its revenue comes from the European market.", "So given that we had such a small footprint, we were actually fairly happy with the kind of penetration that we are seeing in Continental Europe which has not been a market which has been very big for us given language issues or labor regulations etcetera. But all the accounts that we have opened in BFSI this quarter have come from Continental Europe. So we\u2019re seeing a resurgence or a significant surge in terms of our clients or prospects wanting to engage with us and going deeper and wider in terms of the services that they buy from us for those accounts that -- those -- companies that work with us.", "We\u2019ve seen good growth in BFSI in the U.S. as well, especially in the insurance sector. That is an area of big focus for us again. Certain regulatory changes in the U.S. market and in Europe are driving some of the increased desire of insurance companies to work with companies such as ourselves, such as us. Our focus on the Asia Pacific market is beginning to yield dividends. Our Australian business is doing very well, our forte into Japan, our foray into China etcetera is also beginning to reap big dividends.", "The focus continues to be on risk management compliance which continues to be the big money spinner if you will. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction in mobility. We\u2019re seeing traction in the area of data quality in management and in the BPM space. So a lot of the investments that we had made as part of our Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise, whether it\u2019s in pervasive computing, whether it\u2019s in digital commerce, whether it\u2019s making smarter organizations. Those investments, as I said earlier, are now beginning to turn around and give us the kind of traction in the market as well as driving the profitability up for the financial services sector. Thank you.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Last question just for Bala. Big improvements in margin sequentially, can you give us a typical breakdown in terms of the kind of pluses and minuses that kind of move the margin sequentially?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, the operating margin went up by 1.9% in Q2 as compared to Q1. It\u2019s mainly because of the rupee, because the average rupee dollar rate in the first quarter was $44.78. The average for the second quarter was $46.30, which means around 3.4% depreciation in rupee which contributed to 1.5% improvement in margin and the utilization went up by 1.1%. That contributed another 40 basis points. So net-net, the margin went up by 1.9%.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair and Company. Please go ahead.", "Bhavan Suri - William Blair", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. Just a question on pricing, at the Analyst Day in the past quarters you\u2019ve talked about some of the pricing challenges you faced in some of the commodity work. Obviously you saw a nice pricing increase this quarter. How do we reconcile those two?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See these pricing increases are very marginal, right, 0.5%. In fact, on-site has declined by 1.3% and offshore has gone up by 3.1%. So, these are very marginal shifts. We are expecting the pricing to be stable. And some of the pricing difference -- the revenue productivity improvements come from the shift, that portfolio shift, right. But from a rate perspective, from a rate negotiation perspective, we are expecting it to be stable.", "Bhavan Suri - William Blair", "Okay. And then talking about the shift in services, you\u2019ve been making the investments in SaaS and non-linear revenue, but if I go back even a few quarters that part of the revenue base has remained roughly stable, and the app dev piece of it has remained roughly stable. What\u2019s been growing nicely obviously is the package implementation system integration. How long do you think before this transition that you\u2019ve been talking about for a while now, starts to become more material?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, please remember our strategy is five to seven years. If you look at, today we have consulting revenue and system -- consulting and system integration revenue of 31%. But we started in 1999 and then I\u2019m sure same questions we answered. So these are long-term strategies. Infosys 3.0 and Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise is a strategic direction for us on the next five to seven years. It is the foundation which we are laying for our next phase of transformation.", "So, today we have 20 clients on our platform. We have TCV of $200 million, because the platform revenue is over a period of time. We invest upfront but the revenue comes over a period of time. So, we have TCV of $200 million, but the revenue is only $30 million. But when you look at the platform revenue, when you look at the revenue in the new service areas like enterprise mobility or cloud, when you look at our new investment areas like life sciences or healthcare, we are very confident that it will grow above our average. It will grow much above our average. That is only thing we can focus on.", "Bhavan Suri - William Blair", "Sure. It\u2019s fair enough. And then the questions have come up about the budget cycle. You guys survey your top, you know, sort of 100 customers. As you talk to them, any sense of sort of, while they have started the budgeting process, what budgets might look like next year? Obviously, I know you guys survey them regularly, so I was wondering if you could provide any color based on those conversations.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, it is early, because our survey actually what we do with the clients happened in Jan. It\u2019s not before that. It happens in Jan. This year we are not seeing budget cuts. It is too early for us to predict about the next year and we do the survey only in Jan.", "Bhavan Suri - William Blair", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions guys.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Okay, guys. So over the past three quarters, your growth results and also your commentary about market demand trends have been somewhat less positive than your peers such as TCS and Cognizant. And I wonder if you could give some color on what\u2019s causing that discrepancy? And do you feel like that\u2019s a temporary phenomenon that has just something to do with the timing of your pipeline, but if you can give us some color on what\u2019s causing the discrepancy in both your growth results and in your market commentary, especially since that same scenario may occur again this quarter as it did last quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, we\u2019re the ones who have been talking about caution and the macroeconomic challenges and the environment not being stable. In fact, while we are talking the environment has become more unstable, more challenging and more problematic over the last couple of quarters. Now, I think it is important to look at our performance in the context in which what we are trying to do. We are truly trying to create the next generation consulting system, integration and services corporation. So it\u2019s a different path. It\u2019s a different path which we\u2019re taking.", "Our aspiration is to have superior financial performance, and we define it as above industry average growth and industry leading or one of the leading industry margins, right. That is our aspiration. So, our investments are in that direction. So, when we talk about Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise when we took our Infosys 3.0, those are the foundations which we are laying down to achieve that superior financial performance which is high quality growth.", "So if you look the industry, industry is going through some challenges. Number one, some part of the industry is getting commoditized. Number two, in the long-term, getting large number of highly qualified people will be a challenge. Number three, competition is actually accelerating the commoditization in some cases. If you look at our strategy, it is meant to counter some of these things in the medium to long-term. So, we clearly believe that our strategies will allow us to have superior financial performance as defined by us.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "All right. It seems like maybe you\u2019re in somewhat of an investment transition mode given the longer term aspirations and that definitely makes sense. You also indicated in your comments today that clients are looking for business value and efficiency. And so given this seemingly increased demand for value and efficiency due to the macro trends, does this change in anyway your go-to market approach and the type of offerings and proposals you\u2019re currently presenting to clients?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So actually, we have just gone through a very big transformation in our offerings, right? Because we used to have wide set of offerings. We have brought everything under three broad categories. Consulting system integration is number one, business operations is number two, number three, products and platforms. It\u2019s a huge transformation. And these are very much in line with the industry standards, right? Because what industry considers as consulting and system integration is what we consider as consulting and system integration. And these offerings are totally aligned.", "Our go-to market is through the industry verticals. Our capability building is through the horizontals. So we have totally aligned these offerings in front of the client, right? And these offerings are seeing extremely good tractions. So today we have capability to do end-to-end system integration for our clients. Today, we have capability to put together a proposal which is IMS and IVS and ITO together. Today, we have capabilities to do ITO plus BPO together.", "We also -- this current structure also allows us to do different things in different offerings. So, in the case of business operations offering we can drive productivity improvements, we can do automation, we can drive business value articulation. In the consulting and systems integration space we can drive better capabilities, better deep domain capabilities, we can do end-to-end transformational work. We can use Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise teams for identifying opportunities. In the platforms and products space, we can do non-linear growth, non-effort based pricing, pricing per usage. So, these are three different models and Infosys 3.0 will allow us to actually do the best in each of those different offerings.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "That\u2019s helpful. Just to expand on that though, I mean, with clients more focused on business value and efficiency, does that change in any way the financial profile of the type of business you\u2019re pursuing. I mean does it affect your visibility over the next couple of quarters? Does it affect the margin profile at all of the type of deals you\u2019re trying to sign just because of the shorter-term and value efficiency focus that you\u2019re seeing more with clients?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, business value, when I talk about business value, I\u2019m talking about the impact what we\u2019re delivering is having on their business. It is not about pricing, it\u2019s about having a better solution, it is about having better predictability, it is about driving efficiencies. It is not about pricing. Clients are looking for better value for the money which they spent. Clients are looking for reducing the total cost of operations.", "So as long as we can provide relevant solutions, as long as we can provide unified solutions, as long as we can provide better value for the money which they are spending, we are fine. So, I don\u2019t expect any impact on our financial model or any impact on our margins because of this. The other point is, there are delays in decision making but that has nothing got to do with this. That has something to do with the environment and the caution from the -- uncertainty from the environment.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "I agree. Thank you, Shibu.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you. I had a couple as well. In terms of the financial services in particular, you commented that you\u2019re not seeing cuts. I just want to be clear, are you suggesting that you\u2019re not seeing cuts in the dollars being allocated to you or to service providers versus the broader IT budgets. Because there\u2019s been more mixed comments from a broader set of technology related companies on current demand patterns from the financial services. So, I just want to get a clarification of your comments, please?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, let me ask Ashok Vemuri to answer that.", "Ashok Vemuri", "So, that comment was addressed more towards the addressable space that we are engaged with all the projects or work we are engaged with. We have heard that there has been a deduction to an extent for hardware and software product companies, but we\u2019re only interested in what is our addressable space and we have found no cuts or cancelations there.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Fair enough then. In the last cycle though, if you look back at what happened in \u201808 and \u201809, the hardware, the transaction companies and software transaction companies saw reduced spending before the service providers, including yourself. And a quarter later, a little bit more than a quarter later, then the service providers indicated they also saw some reduction in allocation of dollars. What\u2019s different now?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So, in fact, in the 2008 time period we actually saw the reductions approximately at the same time as the software companies and/or the infrastructure companies did. So in fact, I would say in some cases we were ahead because we were easy to manage in terms of these not long-term contracts. So, there is no annuity contracts or license agreement etcetera. So it was on a work to hire basis and it was easy to negotiate the rates downwards with technology service providers such as ourselves.", "This time basically what\u2019s happened is, in 2008 as we read it, 2008, Lehman Brothers happened. There was a period of paralysis followed by a flight to procurement. This time around, we\u2019ve not seen a flight to procurement. There is more time that our clients have in terms of determining what their overall cost structure should be and they are engaging with us in two areas. One, on trying to change their overall cost structure, not just the rates. So they are looking for more higher productivity, they are looking for optimization. On the other side, they are also engaging with us much more than they have ever done before and definitely much more than they did in 2008. They are engaging with us on the revenue side of the balance sheet which is essentially about creating products, which is about creating services, improving the services for customer centricity, CRM investment, investments in mobility etcetera, on the back of infrastructure and software packages of products that they have already either procured or that they already have.", "So, more and more decisions that we\u2019re seeing are tending towards the build option rather than the buy and implement option. Which is why we feel that this time around, given the amount of time that they have had to prepare for this and the time that this kind of uncertainty will exist for, and they are looking at us for more fundamental changes in their overall cost structure. They are looking at us more on the revenue side of the balance sheet. So, if you look at our numbers for this particular quarter, a bulk of that has come from risk management, governance and compliance. A year ago, we probably made maybe a tenth of what we did this quarter on this particular thing. Last quarter, we made some amount of it. It is still not scaling up. But this quarter the bulk of it has actually come from these initiatives.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Got it. Okay, thank you. Let me just get two more shorter ones in. Why was on-shore pricing down? I would have thought mix would have helped and the trend in the last couple of quarters has been positive for on-site pricing?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See our pricing increases have been marginal. It is not because our rates have gone up, it is because our portfolios have shifted.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "So when you said, when you suggested that pricing would be stable, does that suggest that on-site pricing will also be stable over the next couple of quarters?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes. On-site, offshore and blended, all three will be stable other than portfolio shifts.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. My last one then is your lateral hiring was down a bit at least compared to past quarters. When you think about targets for CY12, maybe you could talk more broadly about your hiring thoughts and in particular address, how you\u2019re thinking about the mix including laterals? And that will be it for me, thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. There is no secular trend. That is a quarter-to-quarter operation. It is also because of the -- truly it is also because of the transformation we were going through. Our philosophy is to do 70/30. 70% from freshers and 30% from laterals.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Shashi Bhushan of Prabhudas Liladhar. Please go ahead.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. When we started the year, we guided for 18% to 20% growth coming entirely from volume growth. But we have witnessed modest uptick in pricing in the past two quarters despite that we maintained our guidance. So even through marginally where we have witnessed negative surprise that we didn\u2019t upgrade our U.S. dollar revenue guidance?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We started out the year with 18% to 20% guidance based on a certain volume and pricing assumptions. The volume and pricing assumptions have remained the same. We have not changed it at this point in time. At the same time, the currency has moved. So, we have re-casted our guidance for the year at 17.1% to 19.1% based on the currency movement.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Okay. Also second part of my question is you\u2019ve mentioned earlier in the call that we have given 23,000 fresher offer for FY \u201913. Are we going to give more offer or are we done with the fresher hiring for the next financial year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We\u2019re done with the fresher hiring for the next financial. I think it\u2019s in progress. We will give 23,000 and that is the number.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "And we have mentioned that we\u2019re going to have 70 to 30 fresher lateral mix. In that case, we\u2019re looking for approximately 33,000 gross hiring for FY\u201913. Any reason for deceleration in hiring in FY\u201913 compared to that in FY\u201912?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Please remember these are all guidelines, right, 70/30. There are multiple ratios which we try to keep. It will never be absolutely 70/30. It will be based on the environment; it will be based on growth, various other factors, right?", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Sure, sure.", "S. D. Shibulal", "And your question was -- can you just repeat the question once more?", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Yeah, as we mentioned that we\u2019re going to give 23,000 fresher offer for FY\u201913, and we have also mentioned that the fresher to lateral ratio would be somewhere in the range 70 to 30, 70% fresher and 30% lateral. Now if we work with that number that means we\u2019re looking for almost 33,000 gross hiring for FY\u201913. I was wondering that why there is deceleration in hiring in FY\u201913 compared to that in FY \u201912 -- ", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually there is one more thing, because even when we do freshers there is a percentage of the freshers which we do hire -- which we will hire on time.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Yes.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Okay. So, there is campus and non-campus hiring even for freshers.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Okay. So, just-in time hiring for fresher also in that, that is possible.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Right. Right.", "Shashi Bhushan - Prabhudas Liladhar", "Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s all from my side.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you. So, Shibu, your hiring plan looks like or it looks like you are a little ahead of planned hiring for the year. Pricing has remained relatively stable if not improving slightly. Can you help us think about or should we think about these metrics as leading indicators, lagging indicators or coincident indicators of overall demand trends?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, we do things as we -- when we give a guidance, when we do these things, it\u2019s always on our current understanding of the environment, current understanding of our pipeline demand, what our clients are looking for. So, I would think that these are all simultaneous indicators. And when we talk about next year and when we say we are hiring 23,000, we have given 23,000 offers, it is based on a projection which we have but it also has things baked into it like off-campus hiring that is just in-time hiring out of campus, lateral recruitment and things like that. So, this year, 45,000, we are already behind by 27,000 or so, more than that actually. So, these are indicators of where we are today and the guidance we have given as of this point.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "So maybe another way to think about it is as you go back in time through other cycles. For example pricing degrade in front of demand starting to drop precipitously or was really pricing more of a lagging indicator of where demand is heading?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Can you please repeat the question, David?", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Sure, just curious whether in prior cycles, did pricing start to come under pressure in front of demand, dropping fairly significantly or did in fact pricing represent more of a lagging indicator?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Okay. David, the thing is I think the environments are quite different because I think when we were in -- if you look at 2003 we were in a pricing bubble. 2008 was a real turmoil and there was some amount of pricing pressure. But right now, at least our understanding and what we are seeing is that clients are more focused on driving business value and better solutions than focusing on the pricing. We are not seeing at this point a go back to procurement kind of situation. So, if there is an indicator which we will start seeing because of the environment, I would think that it will be in the volume rather than price in phase I.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "I see. Okay. I got that thank you. And then just maybe a quick question on the margins. It seemed that the assumption underlying guidance for the rupee would drive a more significant increase in the margins and I think Bala said that utilization perhaps would mitigate some of the increase from currency. Is that the only offset going forward for the balance of the year, or are you capturing, are you providing for perhaps some degradation of the rupee or taking the opportunity to increase the pace of investments, given the excess margin that you may have from the change in currency?", "V. Balakrishnan", "David, right now we\u2019ve given a margin guidance based on the currency level at the end of September. If it remains so, we\u2019ll have offset on the margins. Even if the currency moves against us we always had certain levers on the cost side, right. We have a variable cost structure. We have the onsite offshore mix, if we can push more work offshore, that will be beneficial for our margins. So in utilization, I mean, if we are able to push it up that could be beneficial to our margin. Business mix if you change that, if we move more into consulting enterprise solution kind of business, margins could be better. So you always have a lot of cost levers and if the currency moves actually against us, probably we can use some of the levers. Right now we\u2019ve given the guidance based on the currency level what we are seeing. That is a big upside for our guidance on the margins for the full year.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right. So is there, are you taking any incremental down to the investment line there, Bala, in terms of taking advantage of the excess margin from currency and perhaps accelerating the pace of some of the investments you talked about earlier in the year?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, we always do whatever investments is required for the business. I don\u2019t think we have cut down anything and our guidance is after factoring in all those investments. And if there is any incremental benefit we get because of currency or otherwise, and if we have investment opportunities, we\u2019ll definitely look at it.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon of Needham. Please go ahead.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good evening, everybody. I had a quick question, Shibu, in terms of the insurance vertical and the telecom vertical, they\u2019ve been soft spots for you guys for a couple of quarters. It seemed to held out pretty well this time around. Maybe just give us some sense of -- has the worst been behind for these two sectors or just maybe an update in terms where the trends are for these two verticals?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, actually we have focused on these areas. We have put in leadership and we have invested. So, let me ask Prasad to comment on the telecom space and Ashok to comment on the insurance space.", "Prasad Thrikutam", "Yeah. So this quarter, we did have a good performance on telecom. One of the conscious things that we\u2019ve done over the last couple of quarters is to try and reduce our percentage of spend on our posted revenue on wireline and move it more into the cable and the wireless. So, from a wireline perspective which is under quite a bit of pricing pressure -- not so much pricing pressure, I\u2019m sorry, it should be more cost pressure of our customers. We\u2019ve actually reduced our wireline business from about 80% to 74% this quarter, but we have increased our cable and our wireless business substantially.", "Wireless, actually grew 70% quarter-on-quarter and then the cable grew about 40%. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re focusing. So, we\u2019ve seen some good traction. We\u2019ve also won a transformation program this quarter on telecom. So, overall our strategies are beginning to work, the focus on business transformation and focus on the Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise based platforms are beginning to work for us. So, I think it\u2019s definitely a good place where we are in right now, we feel good about where we are on telecom.", "Ashok Vemuri", "Hi, this is Ashok. On the insurance and healthcare part of the question, what we\u2019ve essentially done is to allow us to recruit talent in these areas, to focus and build capabilities in these two particular sub-verticals. We have taken healthcare and put that for the U.S. market into our subsidiary called IPS, so as to provide much more focus and capability building there and platform building, which is a very big play. So, we\u2019ve -- actually the three accounts that we have opened -- we opened three accounts, in the healthcare sector in the U.S. Insurance is actually beginning to find significant traction in the European market. Some of the regulatory changes there are driving more usage of the global delivery model and we are also consolidating our portfolio in the U.S. market on the insurance side and beginning to see some traction build up there as well.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company", "Thank you. I just have one follow-up on the healthcare front. I mean, when I compare Infosys with some of your larger peers, it seems like your healthcare practice is relatively small. I know there has been some talk about potential acquisitions; maybe just give us some sense of what the game plan is to scale that business up to take advantage of some of the regulatory changes that are coming down the pike?", "Ashok Vemuri", "Yeah, undoubtedly the healthcare practice for us is much smaller than our peer group. I think we got off the blocks kind of late. And even though we got off the blocks late, we lost our way somewhere again. So now we have consolidated all of that and it is a big focus area because we see that having a significantly large potential and opportunity in the U.S. market. So, we have put it in IPS which is our subsidiary company.", "We are in not only for healthcare, but across the board we are looking at inorganic options which will allow us to pursue the strategies that we\u2019ve adopted which is in the space of consulting, system integration and definitely in the space of product platforms and solutions. But we clearly do understand that we have catching up to do in the healthcare business and we are fully prepared from our strategy and action plan perspective, we are more than ready and we should be able to see some of those results, tangible results, as we progress the quarters.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company", "Great. Thanks. Just one last question to Bala, can you just remind us about the specifics on the hedging in terms of, at what rate are you hedged and what is the timing of the hedges in place? And what impacts have you built into your other income item in terms of the hedging impact?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, we had taken a view that because the currency environment is too volatile, we\u2019ll take a very short-term view on the currency movements and we\u2019ll hedge up to next two quarters of net exposures at any point of time. The time horizon for our hedging is not more than one year. So, currently we have around $742 million of hedges, last quarter it was $745 million. In the current quarter, we had some impact on a non-operating level of around 6 million or so because of the hedging impact and we mark-to-market all our hedges at the end of quarter at the closing rate. So, the closing rate for September was 48.98, so all the hedges were mark-to-market at that rate.", "For December and March quarter guidance, we have not assumed any impact on the non-operating level because of the hedges. Because it is mark-to-market at the current level, any incremental move happens that could impact which we don\u2019t know. So we have not factored in any currency impact on non-operating level for Q3 and Q4.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen due to time constraints that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo to add closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone for being on this call. We look forward to talking to you again during the course of the quarter. Thanks and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Mahindroo and members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen with that we end this conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines."]}

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thank you, Merina. A very warm welcome to everyone on this call to discuss Infosys\u2019 financial results for the quarter ended December 2011. I\u2019m Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Let me start by wishing you all a very Happy New Year. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S. D. Shibulal, CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan and other members of the senior management team. We\u2019ll start the proceedings with a brief statement on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter followed by the outlook for the quarter and year ending March 31, 2012. Subsequently, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunctions with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019ll now like to pass it on to Mr. S. D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you, Sandeep. Good morning to everyone. We had a good Q3 quarter. We have grown by 4.4% in constant currency and 3.4% in reported currency. Our revenue is $18.6 million in reported currency and $18.23 million in constant currency. Margins are up by 3% quarter-on-quarter from 28% to 31% operating margin and net margin is also up quarter-on-quarter from 23.5% to 25.4%.", "This has been a good quarter for client additions as well as for deal wins. We have added 49 new clients this quarter, 18 of them net, 6 of them in Fortune 500. Interestingly enough if you look at the last nine months, we have added 120 new clients which is probably one of the strongest client additions we have seen in a nine-month period in the history of Infosys. It means that clients are choosing us. Clients are choosing us as a partner in their journey, and as and when they decide to spend, as and when they become confident about their spending, we will definitely benefit from that.", "Quality of growth is pretty good. This quarter, in constant currency terms, our pricing has gone up -- our revenue productivity has gone up by 0.8%. Year-on-year, it has gone up by 5% and if you actually look at the last nine months, it has gone up by 6.1%. This is a reflection of our tremendous focus on high quality growth. We are focused on high quality growth and we clearly believe that as long as we deliver business value, as long as we participate in the growth and the differentiation journey of the client, as long as we strengthen our strategic partnerships, we will continue to achieve that in the long run.", "We had good wins this quarter. We won five large deals, one transformational deal. Two of the five large deals were more than $500 million, including (REBIT). It\u2019s a strong quarter for large deals. Growth has been all around this quarter. We have seen the non-top 25 grew by 4.9%, which means that the broader base of clients grew this quarter.", "Attrition has come down from what it was four quarters back. In Q3 of FY \u201811 we had attrition of 17.4% and this Q3 we have attrition of 15.4%. So, there is a 2% drop in attrition on a quarter-on-quarter basis from last year this quarter to this quarter. Our product and platform strategy is working well. We have $300 million of booked revenue, TCV in the pipe, and multiple deals. Finacle is also doing well. We had 10 wins this quarter. We have -- as I said we have signed multiple large deals.", "Now, in this background I also want to give a color on the environment. The environment is definitely volatile. It is challenging. It is challenging for our clients. There is overall uncertainty in the market. The European crisis, the unemployment in the U.S., lack of political will to quickly sort out some of these issues in the coming election year, and downward trend in growth in emerging markets. All of these are concerns for our clients and they definitely have less visibility about their future. They are not confident about taking decisions and that is being reflected in the velocity of decision making, velocity of business. There is marginal downturn in the velocity of business from the beginning of Q3 to the end of Q3.", "We had noticed it early on, and in the middle of Q3 we had said that our revenue will be closer to the lower end of the guidance and that\u2019s where we ended up. We have -- based on all this, we remain cautious. We have given a guidance of flat to 0.2% growth for Q4. Budgets are being finalized. We expect majority of the budgets to be closed before the middle of February. Early indication is flat to marginally down, that is the early indication. The critical question is that even after closing the budgets will they spend. And that will be determined by multiple factors, the factors about the environment as well as factors about and their confidence in their future.", "Being said that, if you look at our new strategic direction of Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise and Infosys 3.0, it is very clear that we participate in all facets of clients\u2019 business. We do transformational work which will enable them to create growth. We do operational work which is a driver for efficiency and productivity for the clients, and also reducing total cost of ownership. We are seeing traction in the products and platform space which is a way for us to deliver innovation through the Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise framework to the client.", "So, we clearly believe that as long as we are centered around the client, centered around client\u2019s priorities of growth, differentiation in return on investment. As long as we strengthen our strategic partnership, as long as will deliver higher business value, as long as we build more and more capabilities in the local markets, we will be able to achieve our aspiration of high quality growth.", "With that let me now hand it over to Bala.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning, everyone. We had done better, another challenging environment where we are in. In the beginning of the quarter we gave a guidance of 3.4% to something around 5% growth in revenues because the clients\u2019 budgets looked good and the indication was they could spend the budget. But when we went to the quarter, the environment became much more challenging. The concerns on global economic environment only increased. That made the clients more cautious on the spending. So, in the middle of the quarter, we came and updated saying that our growth could be somewhere closer to the lower end of the guidance. And if you look at the actual numbers, that is where we ended up with.", "Our top line grew by around 3.4% and the EPS grew by around 11.8% for the quarter. The operating margin increased by 3%, mainly on the back of rupee depreciation. The average rate of rupee was $51.37 for the quarter as compared to the $46.30 for the last quarter, resulting in a deprecation of 11%. It could have technically increased the margins by around 4.4%, but we have some increase in other costs and the utilization to drop to some extent. So, net-net, our operating margin went up by around 3% for the quarter.", "On the non-operating side, the overall losses because of foreign currency is only $4 million, because we had a hedging loss, to some extent was offset by the translation gain what we saw, and the interest income has gone up because the yield has gone up. The average yield on our portfolio is something around 9.7%. The effective tax rate is around 28.6%, but if it\u2019s normalized to non-operating income, the effective tax rate on operating income is stable at around 27.8%. We guided for an EPS of $0.79 to $0.80. We ended up with $0.80. So, net, net, on the top line, we are closer to a lower end of the range. On the EPS front we are at the higher end of the range of what we guided for.", "We added 9,655 employees. Our guidance was 8,000. The attrition rate too has come down to 15.4% for the quarter. Our DSO days are 61 days. We have a hedging position of something around $847 million at the end of the quarter. We believe the currency markets will continue to remain volatile and we do take a short term view on the currency and hedge for the next two quarters at any point of time. We are continuing with the practice. We\u2019re not changing that because we believe that the currency environment will remain volatile for some more periods to come.", "On the guidance, we had revised the guidance for the full year. We assume the revenues to be flat from what we ended up in Q3 for Q4 too. We assume the currency at 52 for the next quarter. We assume the pricing to remain constant from what we saw in the third quarter. So if you put all this together, we believe our operating margins for the full year, that is fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, will remain stable within a narrow band of 50 basis points.", "So, net, net, I think we are in a challenging environment. The clients are cautious, the budgets are getting finalized. We will have a better view of fiscal 2013 maybe in the beginning of April. But as long as the environment is stable, I think next year could span out to be better, but if there are any catastrophe in Europe, probably it could impact the global markets and it could impact the sentiments of clients. It\u2019s too early, the early indications are that budgets could be flat or slightly down. What is relevant for us is off-shoring components in the budget. Hopefully, if the environment remains stable and if there is no, any big shock, hopefully the next year could look better.", "With this I conclude. We\u2019ll open it for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, good morning, or good evening. Could you talk about the difference between growth in Europe and the U.S., somewhat surprisingly you had Q-on-Q growth in Europe, U.S. was less so?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me request B.G. to give some color on the European growth and Ashok to give some color on the U.S. growth.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Hello, yeah, this is B.G. Last quarter Europe we saw significant growth primarily driven on two fronts. One is, existing clients across financial services, manufacturing sector and retail. We saw uptake in growth from existing programs as well as cross-selling new services into these accounts. We also saw a significant jump in the number of clients we added during the quarter, 14 new clients added in the quarter within Europe. Again, the clients are spread across different segments, but also equally spread across U.K. and the continent. We also saw two large deal wins in Europe, and both in the order of magnitude of $500 million each, and some of it is existing business which is getting consolidated. And these are multi-year deals.", "So this is definitely one of the best quarters in Europe in the recent past and while there has been a spike in revenues within the quarter, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean secular trend, but at the same time we have significant traction by adding new clients and adding new deals of sizeable nature, and this could help us give us good growth momentum at least for the next two quarters. The external environment in Europe continues definitely to be uncertain. There are no easy answers for fixing that problem but at the same time we see a fair degree of stability within our clients in terms of their businesses. At the same time, there is enough caution and the client IT spend early indicators in Europe continue to be downward or flat. So this is what we see as of now.", "At the same time we continue to invest in Europe. We see from medium-term to long-term perspective, there is enough opportunities for Infosys. We continue to invest in Germany, France which are still under-developed from outsourcing perspective, but we have seen our investments paying dividends in the last two years. These two markets have grown at 40% to 50% year-on-year. Our near-shore centers in Czech Republic and Poland, we continue to invest and we are adding talent to support the continental market. Thank you.", "Stephen Pratt", "Hi, this is Steve Pratt. I\u2019ll just give a quick commentary on U.S. and then maybe Basab, the Head of Sales can discuss also. So the quarter-over-quarter growth in the U.S. was 0.9% which is less than Europe. I wouldn\u2019t draw too many conclusions, sometimes our business, especially with big deals is lumpy and so I don\u2019t think this is a trend that we would see over time. The U.S. business continues to be very healthy. We\u2019re very strong across sectors and I think it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that we\u2019ve just gone through a very important transformation of our company to what we are calling Infosys 3.0, which is really consolidating our service offerings around business IT services, around consulting and systems integration and products and platforms which really gives us a simplified and consolidated organization structure, and also align by vertical so we\u2019re closer to the client. So, with that, the last piece that went into place at the beginning of Q3. And I think we\u2019re very well positioned to compete strongly going forward. So, I\u2019ll turn it over to Basab.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "My last question is just on apples-to-apples pricing this is about that time a year where you\u2019re talking to your clients. Could you just give us some sense on, just sort of the apples-to-apples-based pricing in your different offerings? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, pricing we are seeing as stable. Actually as I said, pricing has gone -- our revenue productivity has gone up. Even this quarter our revenue productivity in constant terms has gone up by 0.8%. Year-on-year, the revenue productivity has gone up by 5% and actually if you consider a nine-month period, it has gone up by 6.1%. Which means that our constant focus on delivering higher and higher business value, engaging with our clients better and better, building new capabilities in consulting and system integration, creating non-linearity through products and platforms is yielding results. It is in a tough environment but it is yielding results. And right now we\u2019re considering the pricing as stable.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "My first question here is, can you be more specific about what you are seeing in the macro and is there a chance that this is specific to a particular group of clients or a particular area within your client base? In other words, I\u2019m wondering have we seen any delays? Are budgets being set later than usual, what would cause that March guidance and do you think it is specific to a particular group of the revenue base?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I did not get that question properly but I believe your question was about budgets and decision-making, is that right?", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yeah, that\u2019s right, and maybe you could just hone in on what is happening there?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, I will give part of the answer and then I will hand it over to Basab to give a wider picture. You see, what we\u2019re seeing is velocity of business coming down, and it has marginally come down. In the beginning of Q3 itself we said there is slowness in decision making and multiple scrutinies of large opportunities. We have seen that marginally increase during the quarter and velocity of this business margin they are coming down. In fact, we noticed it halfway through the quarter and that is when we said that we will be closer to the bottom of the guidance. Now, let me ask Basab to give you a little more color and then probably it can come back to me.", "Basab Pradhan", "Okay. I also sort of only party got the question, but just continuing from where Shibu left off, what we are seeing on the deal sizes especially with respect to how clients are seeing their own budgets, there is a general cautiousness in our clients where there they have the money to spend. They believe that technology is important for them, it gives them competitive advantage. They want to get that competitive advantage but at the same time because of the things that are happening especially, what\u2019s going on in Europe and how it might impact their own business, they don\u2019t want to make very long-term commitments. So, even when we do let\u2019s say a big transformational deal, the first, we might do a big proposal, but first statement of work will be for a particular scope, which is more contained. And if they choose to stop it after that they get some value for the money they have spent. So, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question completely or not.", "S. D. Shibulal", "And let me add to it a little bit more. Occasionally, we are seeing that even in the programs which are in flight where the ramp ups are supposed to happen, there has been some delays in getting the ramp ups done. At the same time we are not seeing cancellations. It\u2019s important to note that we are not seeing cancellations. But you see 30% of our work is in consulting and system integration. The average lifespan of a program is somewhere between 9 to 18 months. Which means that if I consider it as nine months, every quarter I have to refill the cup with one-third of the transformational work. So, if the velocity of business comes down then that creates challenges in doing that and also growing on top of it. So when we talk about velocity of business, and it\u2019s marginally down, what we mean is delays in decision making, larger opportunities getting scrutinized multiple times, programs which are on ramp up cycle getting slowed down, and general caution in spending even though the budget is there.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. I think in the past Infosys has talked about wanting to outgrow the industry and it looks like this year\u2019s growth rate is far on the line, maybe on the bottom end of where the industry is going to grow. How do you view that philosophy going forward with all the changes and what can we expect in regards to that going forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Again, it was not clear, but I believe your question was about how do you see the future, is that right?", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "That\u2019s right. Yes. I mean (inaudible) 16% to 18% for this year, you\u2019ve talked about outgrowing that rate on a consistent basis but you\u2019re at the lower end of that. So I am curious as to how you view those comments going forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So you know it is too early for us to comment on the next year, but there are some fundamentals which have not changed and I think it\u2019s very, very important to keep that in mind. So, it\u2019s early for us to give any guidance on next year. The budgets are getting closed. We expect them to get closed by February middle. We expect them to be flat and the early indication is that it will be fat or marginally down. So that is on the budgets. The critical question is will they spend the money next year. Our belief is that if there is no catastrophe, if there is no event which is a catastrophe event, the clients will get used to the new normal and then they will start taking decisions because they all, they have to do it, right. Because they need to do it. So, our belief is that if there is no catastrophe event, clients will start taking decisions. That is point number two.", "Point number three is that they will go with partners whom they have chosen. That is where that new clients openings, the existing client base favors us big time. When we talk about 120 clients being opened over a period of nine months, even if the net is about 50 or 60, that means we have opportunities to grow in new accounts, 50 or 60 of them as and when they take the decisions. Clients have made their choices on whom they want to spend the money with. So if the second argument is correct, then as and when they start taking those decisions, it will benefit us. That is number three point.", "Number four is, if you look at our strategic direction we have made a clear direction towards making sure that we are part of the journey in every aspect of their life. They will spend money on transformation to create growth because they need to create new products, new services, new consumer experiences. They will spend money on operational efficiency because they need to reduce total cost of ownership. They need to drive productivity improvements, they need to drive better efficiency and better alignment. That is where our operations services come into picture. And today having integrated operation services really places us in a very, very good position to take advantage of that opportunity.", "And number three is about innovation. Our products and platform play, as well as our Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise framework gives us a clear opportunity for us to co-create or co-innovate with our clients. In fact, every conversation I\u2019m having with CSOs is leading to a co-creation workshop. And last quarter we had closed a deal which is moving a client from country-centric approach to client-centric approach. This quarter we have closed a deal where we are moving a client from a non-profit to a listed corporation. All of these are being done in the Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise framework. And either through transformation or through the TPS track.", "So we clearly believe that the strategic direction we have taken will put us in enormous benefit as long as we continue to focus on the client, continue to partner with them on their growth journey, on their transformational journey and provide better and better business value. So in the long-term, we believe our strategies will definitely help us produce superior financial results and that is high quality growth.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And lastly, just really quickly, have you changed your approach to guidance at all and methodology just given the volatility in the environment? Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, there is no change in the guidance methodology. We have always said that our guidance is a statement of facts as we see it at that point in time. In the beginning of the year we had given a guidance of 18% to 20%. Last year, purely due to currency fluctuations, purely due to cross currency movements, we had re-casted that guidance to 17.1% to 18.1%. In the middle of the quarter we had said that we will be closer to the lower-end of the guidance due to emerging situations. Now, given where we are, we have given you a flat to 0.2% in guidance for Q4.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Thanks. Bala, what\u2019s embedded in terms of the performance by the specific vertical in your March quarterly guidance? You\u2019re talking about roughly of sequentially flat revenue growth. Are we going to see some verticals underperforming being down year-over-year versus others, and maybe you could give us some more color on that? And then should we expect anything in terms of major movements looking at North America versus Europe on a sequential basis? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, we are not seeing major differences across verticals and we are not expecting that next quarter either. And interestingly enough, even during the downturn in 2008, 2009 our financial FSI segment was within a band of, within a very narrow band of 33% to 35% of our total revenue even during that major, major downturn. So, we don\u2019t expect any material change in our performance. There may be marginal changes but no material change in our ratios, neither in vertical nor in country.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "You mentioned (inaudible) deferrals when your project starts, is there -- are we seeing that maybe more on the FSI, are we seeing that in a specific vertical? In the past, recently, you\u2019ve spoke about deferrals that you\u2019re seeing in Continental Europe by some of the banks. Maybe you can kind of elaborate more on that. I am assuming, we\u2019re seeing more -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even across the board or this is really coming in from one or couple specific areas.", "S. D. Shibulal", "It is more -- see as it\u2019s that we\u2019re not seeing project cancellations at all, nothing abnormal there. The delays in decision making we are seeing across the board. We are seeing it in SSI. We are seeing it in manufacturing in small chunks across the board. But when you are trying to grow and if your discretionary spend is under strain, then that\u2019s becomes a challenge.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "All right. And then final question, are you considering or reconsidering your recruitment plans?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, we are not reconsidering the recruitment plan for this year. We have -- all the people whom we had given offers last year are joining now. Our utilization has marginally come down because of that, because people will get released to production. We had planned for 45,000 recruitment this year and I think we\u2019ll end up at 47,000 gross. We have given 20,000 offers for next year. We are not reconsidering our recruitment plan because of all the reasons I told you before, budgets are getting closed. Unless there is catastrophe event, things will start -- our view is that decisions will start happening. Then we are very well positioned with those strategic directions as well as our Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise framework. So we believe that the decisions will really favor us, as and when it happens.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Hey guys. Just a quick clarification question on the demand environment. Has the decision slowness of clients that you\u2019re citing, has that changed only marginally over the last three months? I think you used word marginally. I just wanted to clarify if that was your intention?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yeah. From the point in which we\u2019ve gave the guidance last time, last quarter to now, it is only a marginal change. But we had given some color at the time also saying that it\u2019s happening, so from there to here it is a marginal change.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Right. Yeah. You\u2019ve been citing decision slowness over most of the last year. That\u2019s helpful. And secondly, in the vendor consolidation events that we see happening around the industry and this has been around for the last several years, are you doing anything new with your strategy to better compete in those vendor consolidation situations?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, we clearly believe that the new Infosys 3.0 architecture is extremely well placed for those kinds of opportunities. What we have done is to -- we had service lines like IVS, IMS that is infrastructure management, independent validation services etcetera, as horizontal service lines. Now, we have combined all our service lines under the verticals and our go-to market always has been the verticals. So, now we are able to create integrated offerings. Very, very, very strong integrated offerings integrated offerings, very, very, very strong integrated offerings. For example, infrastructure management and application management, infrastructure management and independent validation, then independent validation and application development. We are able to create very, very strong integrated service offerings, and I clearly believe that that is of great help. And also on the platform side we have a very strong story.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "Okay. It\u2019s just that the platform part of your business is fairly small at this point in time?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, I can ask Sanjay to give us some color on that particularly.", "Sanjay Purohit", "This is Sanjay here. On the platform side of business obviously -- so now we have 12 platforms in the market and last quarter also we have picked up another four clients, taking our overall client strength to about 23. We\u2019ve booked about $300 million in TCV. This of course is a different kind of a model because the revenue momentum comes over time rather than coming up as upfront. But what\u2019s more important for us is to ensure that we are on boarding more and more clients and we are seeing traction every quarter in terms of on boarding onto the 12 platforms, the Infosys Edge Platforms that we have in the market. So, the good part today is that we are seeing quarter, quarter increase on total contract value and the number of clients that are on boarding on the platform. So while your observation is right that the current revenue is small but what\u2019s important for us is to build the momentum so that we are able to bring this to a substantial revenue stream over time.", "Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein", "All right, great. And Shibu, just one final question on that similar note. Obviously, your growth outlook is not just a function of macro trends since in 2012 you had expected back-end loaded growth in the fiscal year despite macro issues that you were citing. So, I guess, the question that raises is, do you expect your overall quarter-to-quarter revenue growth trajectory sort of adjusted for normal seasonality? Do you expect that growth trajectory could improve after the March quarter based on the strength of your pipeline and some of the growth strategies that you say are gaining some momentum here?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, in a way you are asking for a guidance for next quarter, you know which is very difficult for us to give at this point because there are many factors which goes into that kind of a prediction, right. So, we are very closely involved in the client\u2019s budgeting and spend process and we will have a much better view on this coming April. But I want to say this, we clearly believe that the strategic directions we have taken in Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise framework, Infosys 3.0, the ability to align in front of the clients, the ability to create deals which are cross service oriented, the ability to win large deals, the ability to drive consulting and system integration revenue. All of those things are meant to create high quality growth. They are meant to create high quality growth. We also have the capacity, right. Our utilization is 77%, we have the capacity. We have recruited people who are in training. All of those things are meant to create high quality growth. So, we are very well prepared to take advantage of the situation and we believe that all the strategic directions should allow us to create high quality growth in the long-term. There may be challenges in the short-term.", "Operator", "The next question is from [Dave Kay of BED]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah. Hey guys, I wanted to just ask a very high level question just on this year\u2019s growth and it tended, I guess a little more on the trajectory, but if we break down the 16% revenue growth, it\u2019s about 10%, 11% from just core volume, 4% to 5% from price and 1% to 2% from FX. That\u2019s pretty clear that that breakdown based on what we\u2019ve seen so far year-to-date and the way you\u2019re guiding for next quarter. As we look next year, you\u2019re talking about much more flattish pricing environment which we\u2019ve seen for about four quarters now. So year-over-year I would expect the recent sequential patterns to drive pretty much flat pricing growth and FX is actually a headwind. So unless we see volume reacceleration, the target growth 10% next year and I don\u2019t expect you to give guidance on that core volume growth, but is it at least fair to think about, like you said the pricing environment is stable and FX is a headwind. So to see anywhere near growth that you saw in fiscal \u201912, will be able to see a pretty nice reacceleration in core volume. Is that at least a fair way to put this all into perspective?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So for all practical purposes we are assuming that the pricing will be stable. Which means that the majority of the growth will come out of the volume, that is true.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And at...", "S. D. Shibulal", "But at the same time we will continue to build capabilities and implement strategies which will allow us to increase our revenue productivity. But for all practical purposes we assume stable pricing which means that majority of the growth will come from volume.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That\u2019s great. And then just a second question. Over the last several years we have seen pretty big growth in the interest component or the other income component of pre-tax earnings. So, this year it looks like that the interest component will be about 15% of pre-tax earnings. So, it\u2019s pretty important that the rates hold up. I would imagine you\u2019re seeing a little bit of interest rate weakening with the rupee being weaker. Is that fair, maybe to kind of put in context, what sort of interest rate you see on your cash over the next several quarters?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, we do focus on operating margins. Non-operating, the income related to what we hold in the balance sheet. The interest rate regime is in favor of us now. Today, we get a yield of something around 9.7% on our portfolio. Go forward when the inflation comes down in India, there is a probability that interest rates could come down. You\u2019re right. But our focus always had been in maintaining or increasing the operating margins and non-operating is non-core to us, but we do hold strategic cash to meet our strategic objectives. So that is not a focus area that could go up and down. The key for us and the key focus area for us is maintaining the operating margins.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. You know I am trying, I think the revenue deceleration, I got that piece, but I am still trying to reconcile the margin dynamic. Can you help us reconcile the reported margins, both gross and operating. Factoring in the different variables including pricing, utilization, the incremental investments you\u2019re making in the business, and then obviously the impact of currency?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, David, we don\u2019t look at it by verticals, we focus to manage the whole business as a portfolio. Of course, our revenue productivity depends on different aspects of the business, whether the onsite-offshore mix or the geography mix or the services mix or the vertical mix, so we take a portfolio approach. We don\u2019t try to look at each of our industry vertical, try to see the utilization margin and stuff like that. Because some of the new verticals we start, these are all too strategic. Some of it could be in an investment phase, some of it could be losing money, but at the overall company level, we need to focus on all high growth areas and try to manage it as a portfolio.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right. So I guess what I am trying to understand Bala is that, it appears that you\u2019re talking about flattish pricing trends. I guess utilization is off modestly as you continue to ramp hiring in the face, some deceleration in revenue, and obviously you increased investments. But you had a fairly significant tailwind you know from the depreciation of the rupee. So I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand the magnitude of all these different things and how they are impacting the margins?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, no, right now rupee is a tailwind because rupee has depreciated, but we have gone through times when the rupee appreciated too. See, as we keep saying always, we have different levers within the business. We have the utilization rate, we have the onsite-offshore mix, we have the services mix, and of course the currency comes and benefits or impacts us once in a while. We had demonstrated again and again at different currency level, our ability to maintain margins. Because we do focus on high quality growth that gives us enough flexibility to maintain the margin to some extent in spite of currency level. It doesn\u2019t mean we will be able to do it in the future, but we have done it in the past and our model has enough flexibility to manage it.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Maybe just a different taxi, you obviously decided to maintain your hiring rates and actually exceeded them in the quarter. How should we think about your bench relative to how you managed it historically? Is this really more a time and place thing just because demand trends have softened, or are you thinking to continue to drive growth you may want to maintain perhaps a bigger bench than you\u2019ve done historically?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, we always said we are comfortable with the utilization, excluding trainees, in a band of somewhere between 76% to 80%. The peak, in some year we went to 81%, 82%. We want to retain that flexibility, because if we are looking at an opportunity to grow, you need that capacity in the system. Because when the growth comes we don\u2019t blink. We added more people this quarter than what we targeted. In fact, we targeted for 8,000 hiring. We ended up with 9,655. But don\u2019t forget whatever we hire from October, that is for next year, not for this year because we have a lead time of around six months training for people we hire from the campus and then they become billable. So whatever we are hiring now that is for next year. On an overall utilization front we are comfortable between 76% to 80%. We want to retain that flexibility if we can because we don\u2019t want to miss on the growth.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then just one last question is that in terms of your visibility and not getting into clients necessarily, your verticals, but is the visibility a lot different? I think I understand the dynamic in terms of the economic environment, but in terms of some of the larger customers is the visibility getting worse or is it getting -- did it get better over the course of the quarter in terms of what their spending plans are going to take over the next six months?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we expect that once the budgets are closed and the decision making starts, we will have a better visibility. See there is another point I want to give you at this time. Our pipeline is pretty strong. It is not like our pipeline has weakened. So it is not lack of opportunity or lack of pipeline. What is happening is that the decisions are not happening, that is what is creating the issue. So from a pipeline perspective we have a pretty good pipeline and we closed five large deals this quarter which is pretty good, and it was around $500 million and above. So the deal pipeline is pretty strong. The decision making is where we are seeing an issue. We can definitely hope that after the budgets are closed and people will consider the current environment, our view is that the decision making will happen.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you. My first question follows from the past line of questioning. If you continue on with the hiring plans and growth doesn\u2019t improve, aren\u2019t you at risk for compressing your margins from where we are here and how do you respond to that scenario?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, we are quite comfortable between 76% to 80%. We have operated in that bracket even before, even slightly lower. Now, as what we know -- and another point is as I said, our pipeline is strong. We\u2019re not -- see, you\u2019re looking at one quarter and trying to think it\u2019s a secular trend, and we are not considering it that way. We\u2019re not seeing a secular trend of downturn. We are at this point in time given all the information we have given in the guidance. Last quarter we gave the guidance and when the situation changed we actually talked about it. We are not considering a secular trend of downturn and we clearly believe that in the long term, we will need these people. So, that is why we have continued with the recruitment.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Let me ask a different question, it looks like your top clients, your revenue performance of your top clients is less than the broader revenue performance of the company. Can you speak to why and does that continue?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, actually if you look at the eight quarters and we have -- if you look at it you can see that there are multiple quarters in which the top clients have grown faster than the rest, the rest of the world has grown faster than the top clients. This quarter the non-top 25 actually have driven the growth. So, in that sense the growth is broad-based, which is a good thing. And which also shows that the new clients whom we have added, we are able to create growth out of them. So, I wouldn\u2019t consider that again as a secular trend. It will be a quarter-to-quarter aberration.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. The final one for me then relates to that, when during over the next few -- over the next month, we\u2019re going to get more reports from other companies, and how would you anticipate share to shake out in terms of your relative share in the markets that you\u2019re serving this quarter and over the next couple of quarters, both in terms of client additions and/or revenue, relative revenue performance? Because it looks like you\u2019re, again particularly relative to Cognizant, looks like you\u2019re losing a little bit of share. But I want to get your views on how you would anticipate share dynamics to unfold over the near-term?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, I think there are two factors of this, right. Because the performance is a reflection of the strategic direction and the aspiration which each corporation has. And different corporations take different strategic directions and different aspirations and that is what is reflected in my mind and the performance. So, when you compare performance it\u2019s very important to keep in mind that what is the foundation on which the performance happened. In our case, we are looking for high quality growth. We are looking for high quality growth, what does that mean? Superior growth, superior margins, that\u2019s what it means. And that is our aspiration. I\u2019m not guaranteeing that that\u2019s going to be happening every turn of the next future, but that is our aspiration.", "All the strategies we have put in place, increasing consulting and system integration revenue, Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise, Infosys 3.0, integrated service offerings, local investments in Germany and France, local recruitment in U.S., all of these are meant to achieve our aspiration of high quality growth. Which is higher growth and industry leading, or at least one of the industry leading, but otherwise the industry leading margin, and that is our aspiration. So, when you measure -- compare performance, this is an important benchmark to keep. If you compare performance of the piece rather than the whole, then the observation may not be the right one. So, from a high quality growth, that is the benchmark which we need to compare rather than only one aspect of the performance.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Shibulal, with the two transformational deals that you announced over $500 million, what vertical was that in?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I\u2019m going to ask Prasad, Prasad Thrikutam, who heads our Energy, Utilities and Services market to talk about it.", "Prasad Thrikutam", "So, hi, this is Prasad. There were two transformational deals, one was in our manufacturing vertical, where we actually used our Building Tomorrow\u2019s Enterprise as a platform for creating a future of a specific business process for this organization. So we are actually designing the business process and innovating the business process using technology. And the other one which Shibu kind of mentioned at the beginning, is a company that is based in the U.S. It\u2019s in the services sector. Where they were moving from a not-for-profit status to a for-profit status, which means the entire enterprise architecture, not from a technology standpoint but from a business functions, you know how do they do forecasting, how do they manage their financials, how do they manage their product development strategy, how do they manage their supply chain strategies. The entire set of operating functions of the company were reviewed and then a new strategy was developed. So that is the second transformational win that we talked about. I hope I answered that question.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Yes. Thank you for the clarification, Prasad. My second question was for Balakrishnan. I was wondering, Bala, with regard to the dividend, the company has been generous with its special dividends. The cash flow remains healthy, the growth may be decelerating, wondering if similar to others in the industry, IBM, Accenture, would you consider raising the regular dividend?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well right now, pay up to 30% of our net profit as dividend every year and one-time dividend comes in only when we don\u2019t have a use of cash. Today, we have close to some $3.7 billion of cash. We believe that strategic required in the business, because one of the areas we look at for our growth is also strategic M&As. So if we find some nice strategic fit we\u2019ll use the cash. And I don\u2019t agree with you that our growth is not decelerating. Even if you look at fiscal 2012 we\u2019re still growing at 16%, 16% is not a small growth. And we believe if you look at the opportunities in the market, we have the ability to grow at a much faster pace. You do get impacted by short-term economic environment but if you take a medium to long-term view, we have a potential to grow double-digit for many, many years. There are opportunities in the market. So, I don\u2019t think we have come to a saturated point in growth for us to look at making a permanent, accelerated dividend payouts.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Okay. And my last question maybe for Sandeep. Am I correct that your number one customer which did continue to decelerate, is still in the BFS vertical?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Can you please repeat the question?", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Your number one customer, is it still in the BFS vertical?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yeah. It is in the financial services vertical, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Nabil Elsheshai of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Nabil Elsheshai - Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the investment in sales and marketing, you had seen some pretty steady increases in that and then it declined substantially this quarter. I\u2019m guessing some of that is the euro, but it seems to be down even accounting for that on an absolute basis. So are you cutting back in investments in that and what\u2019s that going to look like going forward, and if so, how does that align with kind of a more long-term focus you guys are talking about?", "Basab Pradhan", "This is Basab Pradhan. So, quarter-to-quarter changes in our sales and marketing expenses are really -- shouldn\u2019t be taken as a trend. We have some lumpiness in marketing expenditure because of some major events that we -- either third party events that we do or our own events as well. But I think the headline news here is, what we are doing on re-architecting our sales force for the future and that is going very well. We have a very good handle on what we need to do for our sales force to be able to take the company into in the 3.0 realm of things that the strategy that we\u2019ve put in place. And that is going quite well and hopefully I will have more to talk about in the coming quarters about this.", "Nabil Elsheshai - Pacific Crest Securities", "So we should expect to see that if it\u2019s just lumpiness, that to reaccelerate going forward?", "Basab Pradhan", "No, I think it\u2019s lumpy so it goes up and down, that\u2019s what I meant by a lumpy. Because we do have some major events. We sponsor -- this time we were lead sponsors on, for instance Oracle OpenWorld, on an SAP event as well. So, these are fairly large commitments from us. That\u2019s what I meant by a lumpy.", "Nabil Elsheshai - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. That\u2019s fine. Just one other question I have, and I apologize if this was covered earlier, but just on the wage front given maybe a little bit of slackening in demand, what are you seeing on the wage inflation side and is the hiring market maybe easing up a little bit?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, wage is a function of supply and demand. This year we gave around 10% to 13% increase in offshore wages. It\u2019s too early to decide on wages for next year. Probably, we\u2019ll get a better view in April, but looking at the situation today we believe the wage increase for next year offshore could be in the high single-digit, not more than that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints that was the last question. I would now like to hand over the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again during the course of the quarter. Thanks and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. On behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Marina. A very warm welcome to everyone on this call to discuss Infosys' financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2012. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. ", "Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan, along with other members of the senior management team. ", "We'll start the proceedings with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the quarter ending June 30, 2012, and year ending March 31, 2013. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending the call. I will start with some color on the previous quarter. ", "Q4 was a difficult quarter for Infosys. It was very challenging quarter for us. We knew it going into the quarter a bit. We had adjusted our guidance in the beginning of the quarter to be flat or marginally up. During the quarter, we faced an unprecedented convergence of a number of events. Our guidance -- when we give the guidance as we have mentioned in the past, we have visibility for 95% of the revenue of the quarter, which means that we have to make up approximately $90 million during the quarter. The first 2 months progressed pretty okay. It was not  exceptionally well, but it was on track -- barely on track, okay. In the third month, we faced with a number of challenges: number one was a set of contractual closure delays -- delays in closing contracts; number two was unanticipated down -- ramp-downs predominantly in the FSI segment in the U.S. This is not a single client-specific situation. It was a multi-client situation with multiple client ramp-down in a very surprising manner during the month of March predominantly. Then we had anticipated a bunch of ramp-ups in wins we had in Q3 and many of them got delayed.", "So in that situation and the way it happened during the quarter and the time in which it happened -- in the time frame in which it happened, we were not able to make up the entire gap of $90 million of visibility we had in the beginning of the quarter. That led to a situation where we did not meet the guidance. We -- our guidance was $1.806 to $1.810 billion. We delivered a revenue of $1.771 billion. ", "On the EPS then, we were able to deliver the numbers. The EPS guidance was $0.81, and we did $0.81. ", "We were able to manage the expenses. We were able to manage the costs and delivered the EPS. ", "So that is about the quarter. ", "For the coming year, we have given a guidance of 8% to 10%. The event, which I talked about, happened predominantly at the end of last quarter, that means the later part of last quarter and many of them in March. There is, of course, an overhang of those events entering into this quarter. For the quarter, we have given a guidance of 0% to 1% growth. And for the year, we have given a guidance of 8% to 10% growth. ", "We have not changed the principles of giving guidance. We have always believed that there should be [indiscernible] information between the external world and the internal world. On that belief, we have given the guidance. It is definitely a much more volatile environment today than in the past. We believe that this will be a new normal and this will be the normal in which we will need to operate. And even then, we have not changed the principles of guidance. We have given the guidance. Our visibility for the coming quarter, actually the current quarter, is, as usual, 95% and for the year it is 65%. And it is a statement of fact as we see it today. ", "We have done quite a few -- quite a number of -- we have done a lot of diligence to arrive at this guidance. And this guidance reflects all the information, all the facts we know at this point in time.", "At the same time, I want to point out that it is a volatile environment and we have taken the bold step of giving the guidance. There has been a number of good things, which happened in Q4 and across the year. In Q4, we added 52 new clients, 8 of them in Fortune 500 U.S. and 4 of them in Fortune 500 global. That takes our client list to 694. ", "During the year, we got a revenue productivity increase of 4.7%. It was a difficult year. Even then, we got a revenue productivity increase of 4.67%, which is a clear reflection of our strategic direction. Our strategic direction of Building Tomorrow's Enterprise and focusing on 3 parts of client business: transformation, operation and innovation, is definitely seeing traction with our clients and that is the way we are providing higher and higher business value, client value to our clients.", "We had good deal wins actually in Q4. Now we had 5 large deals, 3 of them more than $100 million closed in Q4; 7 transformational programs were won in Q4. ", "The third part of our business, products and platforms side, also has seen improvement in Q4. The revenue from products and platform was 6.2% in the quarter. We have, in the revenue from platform, which is an interesting thing to look at, was $25 million for the year, but we exited the year with a $350 million booked business.", "So our model is also evolving, right? Our portfolio is evolving. Our model is also evolving. The products and platforms space is predominantly about investing and actually booking revenue, which has a lot of future potential, a lot of future revenue included. ", "Recruitment. We recruited 1,200 people in U.S. and in Europe over the last 18 months. We are recruiting another 1,200 people in the U.S. and Europe over the next 12 months. This will be new employment, new jobs created in the local countries. This is also very much in line with our strategic direction of increasing our revenue in consulting and system integration. That definitely require more local talent. ", "So from a strategic perspective, we are definitely building a balanced portfolio, balanced from a client perspective by adding a large number of clients, predominantly in the Fortune 2000 space. From an offering perspective, by balancing -- increasing our revenues in products and platform and solutions and trying to build a balanced portfolio across transformation, operation and innovation. ", "Our European revenues have marginally gone up. Again, it's about balancing our portfolio across the globe from U.S., Europe and rest of the world. Our long-term aspiration is to have a much balanced -- much better balanced portfolio geographically.", "So I clearly believe that our investment, our strategic direction, our offerings, our focus is all towards increasing client relevance, strengthening our partnership with our clients and more and more adding a higher and higher client value for our clients. And I believe that, that will definitely benefit us in the medium to short term. ", "With that, now, let me hand over to Bala.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning, everyone. We had done well under the circumstances that we are in. Sequentially, those decline in revenues, but year-on-year, we have seen revenues growing by 11% and EPS growing by around 16%. ", "The operating margin, there was a slight decline in the fourth quarter as compared to third quarter. Our operating margin came down by around 1.1% and that is basically due to rupee because the rupee-dollar rate, which was 51.37 in Q3 has come down to 49.96 in Q4, resulting in appreciation of 2.7%, which impacted the margin by 1.1%. Except for rupee, the margin has been stable from Q3. ", "If you look at the full year, our operating margin came down by around 70 basis points, from 29.5 to 28.8. Again, rupee had a favorable impact of around 2.3%, but the utilization came down from 73 to 69, which impacted the margin by around 2%. We had some decline in our results of around 70 basis points, so net-net, for the full year, we have seen the margin declining by around 70 basis points. If we take the full year, our revenues grew close to 16%, and EPS grew close to 15%. ", "So we have done well under the circumstance that we are in. We had a hedging position of $80 million, $89 million. As of the end of March, the currency volatility continues to be a factor and we are not changing our hedging policy. We're going to hedge for next 2 quarters at any point of time.", "On the utilization front, our comfort zone is somewhere between 76% to 80%. Excluding trainees, our utilization today is around 70%, so we have enough buffers in the system to take on growth when it comes. ", "If you look at the other financial metrics that are DSO. DSO is 63 days, which is one of the best we had seen in the industry. Our return on capital employed is around 40%, 42%. Our operating cash flows continues to be very strong. It is at 25% of revenues. So if you look at the other metrics, too, we had done well. The unbilled revenues had slightly gone up this quarter, that is because we are doing some nice transformational projects that are building milestones or elongated and this is the trend we have seen even in the fourth quarter of last year, so there's nothing unusual there.", "Coming to next year's guidance. We have given an 8% to 10% growth in revenues and around 4% to 6% growth in EPS. We have assumed 35,000 addition in employees for next year, which includes around 13,000 employees for our BPO operations. We're assuming the revenue productivity to remain same for rest of the year. We are not assuming any increase. And we're also assuming the rupee-dollar rate at 50.88, which is what we had seen as of closing for the March quarter. ", "We are assuming the full year operating margin to behave within a band of 50 to 100 basis points. That is what happens in any normal year. In the first quarter, the operating margin could decline by around 200 basis points, mainly because of 2 reasons: All the visas to us gets bunched up in the first quarter because the window for our visas opens up in April and that is a month we spend more on visas. And number two, like we did in last 2 years, even this year, we are going to add some 1,200 employees in the U.S., which are local hires. That is because we want to localize our operations in all parts of the world, and most of those hiring could get bunched up in the first quarter. So for these 2 reasons, the operating margin could decline by 200 basis points in the first quarter. But over the years, we will see some improvement in operating margin and net-net for the full year, the decline could be maybe around 50 to 100 basis points.", "Our guidance is a statement of fact based on what we are seeing at this point of time. Of course, some conservatism is built into our guidance because we are coming out of the tough year and a tough quarter, but it's more realistic based on what we are seeing as clients' budgets and what they're saying to us about their spending. ", "So net-net, we have done well for the year. We have given our guidance based on facts what we are seeing today. And we hope if the environment stabilizes, we'll look much, much better.", "With this, I open up the floor for Q&A. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Shibu, I think it will be helpful if you get us -- maybe dig a bit deeper in terms of some of the things that you've seen towards the end of the last quarter in financial services. I'm assuming that a lot of those issues happened in the capital markets area that's based out of North America, out of the U.S. and then maybe also talk about whether that also impacted your commercial banking business or the insurance part of financial services as well. So maybe we can start with that.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Moshe, let me request Ashok to give you a very detailed rundown if he has -- and he can give you a very detailed rundown.", "Ashok Vemuri", "So Moshe, we had \u2013- some, couple of things happened to us in the financial services space in the U.S. First and foremost, we had some large deals that we had closed in the previous quarter whose transition basically took much, much longer and actually did not start or ramp up in this quarter. And the expectation was that this would ramp up and then the transition would happen and the staffing would begin and that actually got delayed for a variety of reasons, most important one being that the transition -- the client was not prepared for the -- was not prepared for the magnitude of the transition that they had to undertake. The second was that we saw some of our programs in our capital markets space actually get terminated or not -- they actually ramped down in this particular quarter and that actually happened -- some of them were expected, but there were a lot more unexpected ones that happened to us especially for some of the larger names on the street. These programs were in the area -- mostly in the fixed income area. They were few on the regulatory compliance area. In the insurance business, again, in Europe, we had to open some large deals in the insurance space and that also the ramp-ups were very, very slow to minimal. The budgets did come on time, maybe a week or so later. They were flat to slightly negative. But the expensing or funding of the programs that we saw were happening on a month-to-month basis or actually happening in a way that some of these programs were just not getting funded. So if you have a 6-month program, they were funded for the first month [ph]. The expectation is that they will continue to get funded for the next 6 months. But they were inadvertently terminated or deferred for a couple of months or actually, as I said, terminated. The other thing that we also saw is a combination of a lot of these things happening. The other thing that we saw in some of our very large client base, there was a significant shuffle in the C-suite and we lost a couple of very prominent sponsors. And that also delayed decision making as -- for a period of time we were awaiting a new CXO, a new line -- a president to the line of business and once that person came on board, that program was not immediately renewed and was referred back for approvals again. And lastly, I think on the insurance sector in the U.S., we actually had some challenges in terms of -- that's not an area, a very large book for us, an area of strength, so on the property and casualty business some of the clients actually did see a dip. Their budgets were -- came in so low that they actually had to terminate some of the programs. Overall, I would say in the financial services space, most of the impact was in the capital markets -- in the capital markets clients and in the insurance clients. And there were about 3 of them in the capital markets and same number in the insurance space as well.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, in that respect, did anything change since the end of the quarter? Are we in the same mode of a lot of these -- kind of a lot of that volatility since the end of March?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So the ones that got terminated are not coming back. But a few of them that got deferred, about 40% -- about 30% have actually restarted again. The ones in Europe, on the insurance side, we expect to actually kick off by the third week of April. On the insurance side \u2013- but over both on the capital markets and in the insurance side, the programs that got ramped down or got actually terminated, we don\u2019t actually expect them to come back in. Just another quick point is that -- so that we will have to go find programs to replace them. So the other quick point is that of the 12 accounts that Shibu talked about, the Fortune 500, 5 of them are from the financial services class. So this quarter, we were actually -- we continue to see new client additions, 5 of them, 4 in the U.S. and one in Europe from financial services sector, which are Fortune 500 clients.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then just 2 very quick questions here going to Bala. Do -- the number, do your projections for this year, 2013, incorporate any wage comp increases for the fiscal year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So right now, we have not factored in any wage increase for the coming year. We will leave it at this as we progress through the year and we get better visibility. We have factored in some promotions. We have factored in promotions to be done during this year.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And that your hiring plans are staying intact despite some of the slowdown and the uncertainty that you're seeing out there?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Our hiring plan is 35,000 people for the year. Out of that, 13,000 people are meant for BPO and the remaining for Infosys Ltd. We believe the net addition because of this in Infosys Ltd. will be 6,000.", "Operator", "The next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Could you talk about your assumptions regarding pricing versus volumes as you look at your forecast, please?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So our pricing. If you look at our revenue productivity over the year, it has gone up by 4.7% year-on-year in the last financial year. It is clearly a reflection of our aspiration or strategic direction in our portfolio and the way we deliver value to our clients. We have done that in a difficult year. For the coming year, we have assumed, as usual, flat pricing and in constant currency. So that's what we have assumed.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Just to push a little bit on that, given the backdrop of what you mentioned as a challenging year, are there scenarios where you envision pricing actually declining as a consequence of weaker demand?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually, right now, we are not seeing major pricing renegotiation. Of course, as usual at any point in time, you have renegotiations, positive and negative, both going on. And so when we look at the overall portfolio, we don't -- at this point, we don't see any reason to change our assumption. And pricing also has a lot to do with supply and demand and various other factors and portfolio. And that is equally important factor. Our portfolio is -- our aspiration is to make it more and more balanced. And actually, if you look at the direction, it is moving towards more and more balanced, but it will take years to completely balance. That is one. So we are balancing high revenue productivity, services -- volume services as well non-effort-based offerings together. So due to all those reasons, we have assumed a flat pricing for the year at this point.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, I will ask one more question then. If -- I understand you mentioned -- I think you said the net hiring is going to be 6,000 people and at the same time you're trying to change some of the workforce balance to get more consultants on-site. My question is related to that is why, if your utilization rates are down to, excluding trainees, to 73%, why not slow hiring more to reflect the weaker demand and take your utilizations and presumably your margins up?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, if you look at what we are doing, to achieve the growth, which we have projected, 8% to 10%, we need to hire, right? Because we have attrition. Attrition has come down. Actually, the attrition now is 15% -- 14.5% or so. Even if we assume a 15% attrition in Infosys Ltd., I will lose approximately 15,000 to 20,000 people. Then, in the BPO side, the attrition is definitely higher than the Infosys Ltd. So we have to backfill the attrition as well as -- to backfill the attrition, we need so many people even if -- even with, not if, even with the utilization going up. So with this recruitment and with the attrition, to achieve our goal of 8% to 10%, our utilization have to go -- has to go up. That is number one. Number two, on the consulting, system integration trend, our focus is more to hire locally so the 1,200 people we are talking about, recruiting in U.S. and in Europe is, to a large extent, meant to increase our capability and capacity in consulting and system integration.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. My final question and I will cede the floor is do you think you'll lose share in calendar year '12?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Please repeat the question. I didn't hear it.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Do you think you'll lose market share in calendar year '12? Based on your projections, you're growing call it, 8% to 10%. NASSCOM's numbers are higher than that. Do you think you'll...", "S. D. Shibulal", "I don't believe we have lost market share. We are growing 15.8% year-on-year. So given the fact that we are growing 15.8% year-on-year, right, I don't think we have lost market share.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Grossman from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess either for Bala or Shibu, it sounds like you're not raising wages. Utilization hopefully goes up during the course of the year. You got a bit of rupee tailwind as well. Yet it sounds like, overall, that it's possible that margins could be down year-over-year. Can you help us understand where that excess margin is going and where you're investing over the course of the year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "David, we couldn't hear it clearly, but if your question that when the utilization rate goes up, what will happen to the margin or -- is that the question?", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "No. What I was, I guess, pointing out that if you're not raising wages and utilization, theoretically it should be improving over the course of the year and you also have a rupee tailwind to margin. If you bundle all that up, your margins, according to your guidance, could be down year-over-year in fiscal '13. So with that said, where are you investing that -- all those tailwinds that would result in a margin overall being down for the year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think I got the question. I will answer and then ask Bala to add to it. I think for the quarter-on-quarter, I think Q1 is when we will apply for our results, so that has an impact on our -- that has an impact. And I think Bala is going to give you a lot more color on this. Actually, I'm going to ask Bala to explain this clearly.", "V. Balakrishnan", "David, this year, that is fiscal 2012, our utilization is 69%. Next year, we're adding 35,000 people more. So utilization could fall to maybe 67% because we are talking about 8% to 10% growth. So the impact of that on the margin could be around 70, 80 basis points. That is what we are talking about for the full year. Operating margins could decline within a band of 50 to 100 basis points. Of course, rupee will give a benefit, but we do make investment in terms of hiring people in all the global markets. We are making investment in our platform, product solution business. We are increasing the spending -- we are increasing some of the hirings in sales and marketing. So we are making those investments so the rupee benefits gets reinvested in some of this and the impact we see on the margin is basically the utilization impact.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So Bala, could you help us understand better. I think this came out, one of the other questions is with revenue decelerating across-the-board in the business, why would you continue to hire at that rate to drive utilization down again year-over-year in fiscal '13?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So David, there are 2 answers to it. One, I said, if we want to grow 8% to 10%, see Bala's numbers reflected including trainees. So without trainees, our utilization is about 70%, 71%. Our comfort level is about 78% to 80%. So if you look at that and then if you are planning to go at 8% to 10%, you still need an additional number. So the net addition in IL, that is Infosys Ltd., due to all this, is 6,000 people. For the entire year, the net addition is 6,000 people. And so on one side, it is required. There is a second factor also. [indiscernible] Many of these people have been given offers in campuses last year, itself. But it can be clearly seen that the net addition is only 6,000 people. And when you move the utilization from 72% to 78%, all you are getting is about 10,000 people extra, so 16,000 people is what it is. And you are looking at about 10% growth.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and perhaps we can follow it up offline. Just one other question is in terms of the client-specific stuff that you talked about, I think you mentioned that some of them were just being terminated outright. But do you think that the programs or the clients where you're seeing duress [ph], do you think you've seen the bottom more or less in terms of the client-specific fundamentals that you're seeing this year or do you think that those clients are otherwise go on a period of transition that you could see incremental deceleration as the year progresses?", "S. D. Shibulal", "David, again due to some reason, your line is not clear. I got bits and pieces of that question. So I think one question you were asking was that do you believe we're seeing the bottom. Please remember what we said about access, that many of the events actually came together only during the very later part of last quarter. So in that sense, there is a bit of overhang, which is continuing. We have looked at -- we have done a lot of analysis before giving the guidance to make sure that our principles are not violated. We have evaluated the situation of all of our clients. We have talked to all of our client partners and master client owners who actually look after our clients. We have looked at our book of business. We have looked at our clients. We have looked at the budget, why the budgets have closed. We are not seeing a spending velocity. We have considered all these before giving the guidance. And so given all the facts, which we know at this point in time, this is the number. And we believe that unless something totally surprising happens, this is the number we see at this point in time.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, Shibu. If I could just sneak in one more, just on the wages. Is your sense that wages are going to be relatively flat throughout the industry for the year? Or do you just feel that you're that much above the industry that you really don\u2019t feel that you would be competitively compromised by holding them relatively flat?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think different people will react in different ways. So because of the volatility we have seen in Q4 and because of the volatility we are seeing coming into Q1 and the overhang, which I talked about, we felt that the right decision for us to do is to delay the compensation increase at this point in time, look at it again in Q2 or Q3. That is what we shall see. If you look at the history, whenever we have done this in the past, as in when the situation got more -- got better and more clearer, we have quickly gone ahead and done compensation changes. That is what we have done in the past. Eventually, actually, there are years in which we did extremely -- actually high compensation increases actually after delaying. So we always believe that we have to be fair to all the stakeholders and we believe given where we are, it is the right decision to make. At the same time, as I said, we are rolling out promotions. We are rolling out promotions effective July 1 for a large number of people. And we also rolled out -- actually in October, we did 7,700 promotions. So we just did one cycle of promotion, about 4 to 6 months back. And we'll be doing a pretty large number of promotions beginning of second quarter. So I believe we have taken the right decision.", "Operator", "The next question is from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "This is Jeffrey Rossetti in for Joe. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on your growth assumptions for financial services for the year and how you expect some of the Q3 ramp-ups that were delayed to progress?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So let me request B.G., B.G. Srinivas to give you that information.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Yes, so given the fact that we are exiting the quarter with shrinkage in the quarter-on-quarter revenues and the fact that even the Q1 number is looking muted, for the full year, the outlook for financial services will be marginally below the Infosys' overall growth rate at this point in time. At the same time, as we see opportunities during the quarter, there are a couple of these in the pipeline, depending on both deal conversions as well as decisions on these decisions for deal closures. We could be revising this, but at this point in time, it is still muted.", "Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and any detail on the change in leadership in the financial services and manufacturing verticals? And if there's any, could you talk about any impact that you're seeing from accelerated visa rejections in the U.S. essentially impacting any of your business in the U.S. at all?", "B. G. Srinivas", "No, the transitioning between me and Ashok, between the manufacturing sector and financial services has started a couple of months ago and that transition is going relatively smooth. There are no issues with respect to any of this, to the business as usual because the respective teams continue to run the business and then this is not something unusual. So there's no impact on the business because of the leadership change. We will continue to build on the respective unit strategies and focus on furthering the growth. The second part of the question was related to delays in visas. Again, this year, we have planned for visas ahead of time. We have already started to process the visas. We applied first visa applications and we should see a number of visas coming in, in time though there have been some queries on some of the visa applications across the industry. But by and large, we have sufficient numbers filed to take care of the eventuality.", "Operator", "The next question is from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC", "I had a question on your intellectual property portfolio. Happening in the last quarter, you did -- I'm sorry, in your Analyst Day you mentioned about 2,000 patents in work. And if you look at the companies like IBM, they had run their IP as a profit center, not as an insurance policy or as a cost center. They run it as a profit center. And we have done some patent analysis on your applications as well as the granted patents and I think they are extremely, extremely strong both in cloud as well as in social media. I was wondering have you been approached or are you approaching companies like Facebook or other companies to exclusively license those patents? Or enforce you patents on violators so that probably you just look at there are $1 billion being spent for 800 patents that AOL sold to Microsoft. So I'm just thinking, other than just granting insurance to the customers' ventures on user's proposition, have you thought about enforcing your patents and any thoughts about how do you intend to monetize that?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So thank you for the question. I will request Sanjay Purohit who heads our Products, Platforms and Solutions Group to respond.", "Sanjay Purohit", "When we're looking at our intellectual property-based strategy, we essentially are looking at it from 2 perspectives: one is how do we develop intellectual property that we can use to improve quality and productivity of these services across our suite of services in the consulting systems integration as well as IT services; and second is how do we use our intellectual assets and intellectual property to actually create new products and platforms that we can take to market as outcome-based offerings to our clients. Obviously, in all of these spaces, we have identified specific areas that we want to make investments, and whenever you do a landscape analysis of such an area, you formulate an IP strategy, which includes what will we develop, where will we partner, where will you build, what do we do with our patents. And we are pursuing in line with that -- with that line of thinking. In that context, when we look at individual spaces, the offerings we have in the space, in the products and platforms, we take decisions as to how you do you want to leverage our intellectual property for either internal or commercial use or look for partnering with other people who have intellectual property that we can actually leverage together to take new offerings to the market.", "Operator", "The next question is from Shashi Bhusan from Prabhudas Lilladher.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "During the call, you attributed the weakness to challenging macro and then changing leadership for clients and project ramp-up business. Are these the only issues or we are also seeing weakness because of protectionism by the Western world and competitive bidding by peers or our stickiness to quality rather than quantity?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think it's predominantly the factors which we mentioned, that is the lack of confidence in the global economy, some leadership change in our clients and regulatory things being pushed out, in the financial business, the regulatory requirements, the regulatory and compliance requirements being pushed out. That removes the urgency in some of the programs. So those kind of factors. We are not seeing our client base responding to protectionism or things like that. And now, our philosophy always has been to create quality growth and that is superior financial performance, which is a balance of above industry average growth and superior profitability. And of course, there is no doubt that, that is the aspiration. So our aspiration is not to be the largest volume, right? That's not our aspiration. So our aspiration actually drives those strategic direction, the investment which we make, the choices which we make and the performance which we get. I firmly believe that dropping price -- I firmly believe that dropping price is not going to actually drive growth in the long term. It may have a blip. If you look at the different service lines, which we have, consulting and system integration, we are not the pricing umbrella. There are -- the global size we're operating who are the pricing umbrella for us. If you look at business and IT operations space [ph] for the entire Indian [ph] industry, probably we are the pricing umbrella. I don't believe that we can drop price and get higher volume because of the simple reason that it is a closed loop system and the industry, itself, will be forced to readjust. And again, the last point I want to make is that the value, which we deliver -- it's an important point to remember, the value, which we deliver is what allows us to actually get that premium. It is not that we just hold on to the price. It is all about the appropriate client value. So as long as we are delivering value, as long as we are continuously improving our performance, our productivity, our investments and investing in the right place and being innovative in terms of the clients, I believe that we will continue to get the premium. So I don't think one should think of giving up the premium to get volume, and I don't think it will work either.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "So did it happen in the past that either trying to walk out of -- from -- away from us or we walked out of contract just because there was a pricing issue even though the client was premium or if, say, Fortune 500 clients?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There is no doubt that we have lost deals and clients. That happens to anybody in the world. That is part of the business. Like in any business, you lose some opportunities because of price. See, the important thing is that when it is a strategic customer, when it is a strategic client, when it is a large relationship, so these are choices you make not at the corporate level. These are choices, which you make at the individual client level or into individual deal level. When it is a strategic client and if they are going through a tough time, it is our responsibility to respond to it, our responsibility to make sure that their total spend, total cost of ownership comes down. And there are various mechanisms of doing it. It cannot be price at all. It can be more offshoring. It can be more -- moving to managed services. It can be converted into a fixed price. It can be moving to a platform. There are many ways of doing this. So when a strategic client is going through a tough time, we have a responsibility towards it and we try and deliver that through various mechanisms. So to answer the question, it's the losing a deal or a price is something, which is part of every business. I'm sure it has happened to us also. But winning the deal is actually not on price. Winning the deal is based on the solution, based on the client value, which we'll provide and that is where we focus the highest.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "If we look at our client wins over the past 4 quarters, strongest among all the Indian Tier 1 peers, moreover, the net client position has been also the strongest we have ever witnessed and that, too, across the buckets. But when we are seeing quarter-on-quarter growth, it is only turning out to be more anemic in nature. So where are things going wrong? Are these clients, which we are winning are not ramping up, or it's just a ramp-down from some of our existing client is creating the problem?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually, our client wins are predominantly in the right place. They are mostly Fortune 500. If you look at the 52 wins we had, 52 additions we had this quarter, 8 of them are U.S. 500 and 4 of them are Global 500. We have a must-have client list, which is predominantly the Global 2000. And that is where we spend most of our energy adding clients. See, during the -- because of the environment, in many situations, we are actually starting very slow. And that is leading to the observations, which you are making. But these are strategic clients. These are the clients we really want to have. And we really want to have -- the one way to actually manage the bumps and manage the volatile environment, we should actually expand the portfolio in all dimensions. One dimension is clients. During the last downturn, one of the interesting things, which we noticed was that some of our global competitions have client base of 2,000. And so it is very important that we have a large client base that will allow us to mine the client base, that will allow us to manage some of the volatility as we go along. We are applying the same principles to other parts of our business, so we are actually expanding in Europe. It is about -- again about having a balanced portfolio across the globe. Our offerings are also meant to create a balanced portfolio across different kinds of strengths, which the client has.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "So just I will squeeze in one more. If you look at our G&A in the quarter, it has gone down materially over the previous quarter. Any specific reasons for the same [ph]?", "S. D. Shibulal", "That is quarter-on-quarter fluctuation. One cannot look at it as a secular trend.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes, do you think the month of March in terms of demand was weak across the entire industry? And also do you see a reason that demand trend would improve later in the year to support a back end-loaded growth outlook for Infosys?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So our demand trends in later part of last quarter was more weaker in FSI segment than any other segment and a little bit in manufacturing, but down in the FSI and that is where we saw the weakest situation. And now we have looked at our client base over the -- looking at this from the next one-year perspective. We have taken into account any kind of fluctuations they could go through as far as we know, to best of our knowledge. And most of that has been factored into our guidance process. Now, if things improve, we will definitely be ready to take advantage of it. If things don't improve, we will continue to do our best, take advantage of the situation even if it doesn't improve. But if it improves, we will -- we are the ones -- we will be the ones who will benefit because we will be prepared. We will have the capacity. We will have the relationship. We will have the clients and I believe that will help us.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then the weakness that you saw in the financial services vertical, you've given some good color on the specific things that happened. But you believe those things are due to financial services industry-wide trends? Or could it have possibly been just due to some specific issues you happen to encounter in your particular client base?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So I think across-the-board in financial services, there is a structural change that we are noticing. But the speed and rapidity with which it impacted us this quarter is specific to a few clients in the capital markets space and in the insurance space. But Shibu was also mentioning that the amount of investment -- dollar investment and time that was being diverted to ensure meeting regulatory and compliance [indiscernible] issues, that pressure seems to be a little off from a technology and process perspective. But we do -- we are seeing the fact that there is -- some of this has an impact on our competitors as well in some of the accounts where we have been impacted and they are also present.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, and then, Ashok, on the -- you mentioned earlier today as well that there was some particular weakness in the area of risk management and compliance. Is that a market-wide issue or is that due to some client-specific factors where leadership changes occurred and some important work was essentially delayed or pushed out?", "Ashok Vemuri", "So this is specific to a couple -- actually 3 capital market clients where were we had a significantly large programs in risk management and compliance. We have not seen that to be a secular situation across, but this is specifically in the area of -- these are capital market clients in the U.S.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then one final thing, I mean you talked a little bit earlier about the wage inflation and the decision to not give wage hikes this year. If you see some issues with employee attrition or particularly an issue in losing some of the higher potential talent in the organization because of the absence of a wage hike, particularly if competitors decide to go through and actually give wage hikes, is that a decision that you would reconsider very quickly? Or is this something that is probably going to be in place for the next several months regardless of what happens?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think it is important to note that we are not taking a decision not to give wage hike this year. We have taken a decision to delay the wage hike. We will revisit it in the beginning of Q2 and beginning of Q3 again to see what is the right thing to do based on where we are. So it is not about delay -- not having the wage hike this year. It is about delaying the wage hike given the volatility we are in. We are explaining this to our employees. Our employees do understand the challenges, which we are going through. And also, please remember, our value to our employees are multifaceted. We do not base only on compensation. It is based on capability building, it is based on the kind of work which they do and various other factors. So our -- and our attrition has actually come down over the last 2, 3 quarters. Now I cannot rule out the fact there could be a small hike -- a small spike in attrition because of this. But that's part of life. We believe that is the right decision to take at this point in time.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I would now like to hand over the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Over to Shibu for some closing remarks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So once again, thank you very much for joining the call. We look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we conclude this conference call. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

Thank you and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Marina. Good morning, everyone, and a very warm welcome to all of you to discuss Infosys' financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan; along with other members of the senior management. We'll start the proceedings with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the year ending March 31, 2013. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'd now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you, Sandeep. This is Shibu. We have done fairly well in a challenging environment. On dollar terms on year-on-year, we have grown by 4.8%. We have achieved our EPS guidance for the quarter. We have added 51 new clients during this quarter. Our million-dollar clients have grossed 400. Top 10% grew by 2.4% and top 5 grew by 4% this quarter. Our quarterly guidance was $1.771 billion to $1.786 billion. Our revenue came at $1.80 billion, but there are 2 events which happened: number one was the currency impact, which is $13 million for the quarter; number two, we took a one-time reversal of revenue -- reversal of accrued revenue as a matter of prudence on a large transformation program, which got canceled during the quarter.  This happened in Europe in the energy and utilities space. So we took a one-time reversal of $15 million. So that puts the revenue and in reported terms at $1.752 billion. That's a de-growth in constant currency terms of 0.4%.", "Apart from these 2 events, we would have ended up in the middle of the guidance for the quarter. This is a one-time reversal, and we don't expect this to happen on a frequent basis in the future. Our client additions, as I said, has been quite strong. We are continuing to execute on our Infosys 3.0 strategy. We have completed the transformation. We have the new leadership in place. We are purely in the execution mode. The early signs of successes are clearly there. This quarter, we have closed 4 transformational deals, 4 large deals in the bid space, one of them more than $300 million, multiple deals in the Products & Platforms space. We added 10 new clients in the Products & Platforms space. We launched branded, a new platform along with fabric, in this quarter. Our SocialEdge platform has more than 10 clients today, and our book value in Products & Platforms has grossed $380 million. Our new areas are doing well. Cloud, we have 3,000 people working in Cloud, revenues growing above company average. We have 150 engagements in Cloud. Mobility, we have 1,200 people working. We have 60 clients. We have seen very good traction.", "We are also seeing  very good traction with our Building Tomorrow's Enterprise innovation framework with our clients. We had numerous conversations during the last 2 quarters, which are now converted into opportunities or deals for us. So as I started saying, we have done fairly well in a challenging environment. The environment continues to be challenging. We have high exposure to the financial services space. We also have high exposure to the discretionary spend because of our large percentage of revenue coming from consulting and system integration. That makes our ability to predict -- that challenges our ability to predict. We have given a guidance of 7% to 8%. Now we have revised it to at least 5% growth for the year. There are 3 factors which have gone into this division: number one is the currency impact, which is 1% to 2%; number two is the pricing decline, which we have seen in this quarter of 3.7%; and number three are business reasons. All of these have been factored into revising the guidance to at least minimum 5% for the year.", "If you look at the volume growth, it has remained somewhat similar to what we have predicted. Because of the pricing decline, while the revenue is growing at 5%, the volume has to grow around somewhere between 8% to 9% for the year. Now the pricing decline came from 2 factors: number one is the portfolio change. We have seen a decline in percentage terms in consulting and systems integration that has impacted our revenue productivity. Number two, we have seen sporadic pricing renegotiations, pricing or discount demands predominantly in the FSA segment during this quarter. We are not seeing a secular trend, but we have seen sporadic instance of pricing renegotiations on these current demands. Both of them have contributed towards the pricing decline.", "From a volume perspective, this quarter we have grown by 2.7%. With that, let me conclude and hand over to Bala.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Hi, it's Bala here. If you look at the gross margin, gross margin has slightly declined this quarter from 41.2 to 39.6. We have seen this almost same like last quarter. Operating profit has come down from 29.8 to 27.9. It is actually planned in the beginning of the quarter when we said the first quarter operating margins could decline by 200 basis points because we are making those investments both on hiring people on-site and also increased investment in visas.", "Rupee has depreciated by around 9.7% this quarter that could have benefited the margin by around 3.9%, but we have seen the pricing decline by 3.7%, so more or less the rupee benefit has been offset by the pricing decline, and we had made those investment like what we planned in the beginning of the quarter. So the operating profit had seen a decline of something around 200 basis points.", "If you look at effective tax rate, effective tax rate has come down this quarter to 26.7 from 28.8 also in Q4. It has come down because one, we have seen some increase in overseas operations; and number two, the overseas taxable income has come down during the quarter. Both had an impact. We added around 51 new clients. Our DSO days is 64 days as compared to 60 days last quarter. I think DSOs are under control, and we have hedging position of close to $1.1 billion. Last quarter, we had $88 million  to $89 million. We continue to have hedging strategy of short term, looking at next 2 quarters at any point of time, not go beyond that.  Our utilization has come down during the quarter. It's 69.5 as compared to 70.7, excluding trainees and including trainees around 64.7. So net-net, the EPS has come at $0.73. That is what we guided for. We're ending the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash. As I told you earlier, receivables have slightly gone up this quarter, but we don't see a trend there.", "For the year, we have revised our guidance to 5% minimum growth for the full year. Our EPS growth for the full year is predicted to grow at 1%. Our pricing, we are assuming the first quarter pricing to continue for rest of the year. On currency, we are assuming that rupee-dollar rate to continue at INR 55 for rest of the year. And we are also assuming that we'll be adding some 35,000 employees gross for the full year. We added around 9,236 in the first quarter. And the CapEx estimated for the full year remains at the same at INR 2,000 crores, which is close to $400 million.", "With this, I conclude. Now we can open up the floor for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  The first question is from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "My first question is just on the guidance. You've changed the methodology a couple of times over the last couple of quarters, maybe you could talk about why you changed it again this time. And also it seems like you're not giving quarterly guidance anymore, maybe why you decided not to give that guidance as well?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the first principle of guidance is to remove estimative information. That is the basic principle on which we have always acted at and we have always done the guidance. We, in the beginning of the year, had visibility for 65% of the revenue for the year, and 94% in the beginning of the quarter for the current quarters. What we are noticing now is that while we have visibility for the client's budget, we understand some of the areas that they will spend. We are not able to predict some of the movements in large programs, which we are involved in. Because we have a dependency on the discretionary spend, 30% of the revenue comes from that space, that and predictability matters a lot. So at this point in time, when you look at all the facts we know, we are fairly confident that we can do a minimum of 5% growth for the year. We are not able to predict the quarterly revenue and it's actually what we used to do in the past, given the uncertainties that we are faced with. So we have communicated. We have started  this principle to make sure that we communicate the information, the facts, as we know it and that is the yearly guidance. Given the volatile environment, given some of the challenges, which we are faced with, we decided that we will not give a quarterly guidance, at least at this point in time. We will revisit that decision once the environment stabilizes.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And moving on to pricing. I think you said in your prepared remarks that the pricing issue is not secular, but you seem to be pointing in your guidance that pricing is going to decline for the full year. Are you expecting more renegotiations as you go throughout the year? And if it's not secular, why would you include same pricing degradation for the full year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we have seen a pricing decrease this quarter because of the portfolio change, as well as the sporadic pricing renegotiations, which we have experienced during this quarter. See, when you prepare the guidance for the rest of the year, we take the current revenue productivity, right, at the end of this quarter because that is where the revenue productivity is today. So we have to factor in the new current revenue productivity for the rest of the year on the -- for the guidance purpose. It is in a sense very similar to the currency. We have taken the current currency for the rest of the year, right? That is the information which we have, and that is the information we need to use for the rest of the year. It is a reflection of where we are today. There is no other secular trend. We have a new revenue productivity. We have used that to compute our guidance for the next 3 quarters. Did I answer that?", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Just as a follow-up, I mean, do you expect -- I understand it's a snapshot of the quarter, but do you expect more renegotiations throughout the year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We are not seeing a widespread demand for renegotiations or a widespread demand for the renegotiations at this point. We have seen only sporadic ones in the financial services space. We have seen some sporadic discount demands in the financial services space, but times are  going through a tough time, but at this point in time, we are not seeing it as widespread or secular.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. One last quick question. In the past, when business has slowed, you've moved utilization higher, pushed off hiring and kind of protected the margins. What can we expect this time around? Will that pattern repeat itself?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we model our recruitment to the demand, definitely. At the same time, a lot of the recruitment which we do, which is the freshers in the colleges, are done earlier on. So the cycle time is about 18 months. So we had already given offers to 26,000 people last year to join this year, starting now, starting July, right? And as our principle is to honor all the commitments which we have given, we are going ahead with joining of those employees. They will be in training for the first 6 months. We have spaced it out in a way which is relevant to us. The conversion rate is usually about 80%, which means that we'll have about 18,000 to 20,000 people join between now and the next 12 months. And they'll be in training for 6 months. We will continue to recruit laterals to enhance our niche capabilities or to fill-in any areas where we have shortage.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Grossman from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I think in the last call, we talked about hiring in the local markets, I guess, primarily in U.S. and in Europe as well. Can you -- I may have missed it in the release, but can you tell us what your plans are for that year, as well as what you hired locally in the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So hiring in the local markets is very much in line with the push which we are doing with consulting and system integration. If you want to put the revenues in that space, that means if you want to build capacity, we have to hire in the local markets. There are actually people who understand the local business practices and have local demand expertise. We hired 600 people last quarter. We hired 600 people the quarter before. I think this quarter, we will hire 550 people. This is the local hires, and that is the plan right now. The rest of the year also, we will hire as we go ahead.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And, Shibu, let me ask you just about the dynamic about the rupee and pricing. So if the rupee starts appreciating relative to the dollar and pricing stays relatively flat or revenue realization stays flat, how should we think about the margin outcome for this year under that scenario?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So if I look at the past, if the change in rupee is gradual, then we will manage. So we have operated the business at 54 and at 44. So in the past, we have been able to manage our business across the rupee rates. As long as the appreciation or the depreciation is gradual, as long as it doesn't happen at the end of the quarter, in fact, we have seen it once before at the end of the quarter, that makes it very tough to adjust. We have multiple levers also being done. So if you look at the volume growth this quarter, it was 2.7%. If that volume continues to grow and the utilization go up, there is a lever right there. You have the onset-offshore ratio, which is another lever. You have the threshold joining into the system. That means the payment structure changes, so the average compensation comes down. We have deferred the compensation -- I mean, we have postponed the compensation increase this quarter. We just rolled out the current margin factors in the 20,000 promotions and the progressions, which we just sold out. So there are multiple levers to margin. It is not rupee alone, and we have operated at different spectrum of the rupee rate. So I believe that as long as it is not a cliff, which happens at the end of the quarter, we should be able to manage within a small range and make sure that our margin aspirations are met.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right, so -- but historically, I don't think you've been going through the same investment cycle that you are right now. So do you have that same point of view that you can manage it and continue the investment trajectory that you're on right now?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have invested continuously in our business, but it has been in different parts of the business. That is an important distinction to make. So for the last many years, we have been investing in building our consulting and system integration practice. We created Infosys Consulting. We hired local talent. We have some of the best people in the industry join us. And now that investment have yielded results in many ways. So we have a -- our revenue from that space is 30%. It is at about 15% to 20% revenue productivity, higher than the rest of our business. So we do some of the most interesting work. So the point I'm trying to make is we have always invested in our business. Now the focus has shifted. The focus has shifted to a new area, Product & Platform, cloud and enterprise mobility and sustainability. These are new areas, so I've -- we are able to shift part of the investment which we do -- which we did in some of the maturing parts of the organization to the newer areas. It is true that in Products & Platforms, you invest upfront and you reap benefits over a long period of time later on. We are already investing into it. It is all factored into the current guidance. So I don't expect it to drastically go up overnight. I also expect the revenues from some of our new investments to pick up.", "David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then let me just ask you about the revenue guidance. If my math is right, it would seem to imply a little over 3% sequential growth on average if you straight line it through the balance of the year. Can you help us understand how much visibility you have on that based on -- it sounds like you've got 10% unit volume baked into your guidance. How much visibility do you have on that now versus what you would typically have at this point of the year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So beginning of the year, we have 65% of visibility for our revenue. Now we are into the second quarter, which should be approximately somewhere between 75% to", "[Audio Gap]", "for the quarter, usually, we have 95% visibility. This time, we have not given a guidance. So we have -- with all the information which we have, we are quite fairly confident about the minimum 5% growth for the year. There are a couple of wildcards, like if you get a huge pricing change, then that will have an impact. But with all the information which we have today, we are fairly confident about the 5% minimum growth, which we have predicted for the year.", "Operator", "The next question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I have 3 specific questions and maybe the first one is a clarification. There are some people out there coming out with a call, saying that Infosys is starting a pricing war. And at this point, this is going to be hugely disruptive to the sector. What would your comment be on that statement?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, it is a reality that we do deal pricing covers for the offshore industry, but we are not in the game. We always want to have balanced growth. We have not seen any across-the-board price reduction in any of our portfolio. There could be some sporadic price reductions, depending on customer situation, and most of the price change is due to portfolio change in the services to our customers. So we are not seeing any across-the-board price reduction at this point of time.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And at this point, this is not your strategy to try to kind of", "[Audio Gap]", "impact of currency, what you're factoring there, the impact of pricing? Maybe a lower blended bill rate. And then on top of that, the impact from the macro, whether it's cancellations or project deferrals, et cetera?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So if you look at the 8% to 10% on where we are today, there are 3 factors which are going into it. Number one is the currency impact. It's somewhere around 1.5%. Number two is the pricing impact. For the same volume growth, when there's a pricing decline of 3.7%, that impacts your revenue. So even though we don't change our volume growth, we are seeing impact on our revenue. Number three is the business environment in which we operate. We are definitely seeing unpredictability and lack of visibility in the deal closures. We are also seeing delays in deals closures and postponement of ramp-ups. So all of these 3 factors have gone into that 8% to 10% detriment, minimum 5%.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right. And then final question, I think Europe was down about 8% sequentially. Is there a way to kind of get the actual number in constant currency and then also x the contract cancellation that you mentioned during the call?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, see, in Europe, overall, currently, we are seeing the business environment recently stable even though we had a challenge in last quarter. One was, of course, about the cancellation of a large program. And also in U.K., one of our large clients, there was ramp-downs in a couple of programs. So that was the reason. It is definitely, again, which impacted the quarter. But overall, if you look at the current pipeline in the last 3 to 4 months, there's no significant change. The macro environment uncertainty has continued. However, in our client environment, we continue to see a fair degree of stable -- the fact that clients continue to spend, continue to invest, there's no change to that. There is definitely a little slowness in the decision making, so that's the reason why we are saying for the full year, we continue to invest in Europe. We continue to see business growth in line with the guidance we have given. What happened last quarter was a one-time.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me give you some color on the numbers which you asked. Last quarter, the revenue from Europe was 480 -- $408 million. This quarter the revenue is $375 million -- $375.7 million to $376 million. $15 million of that difference came from the one-time revenue rollout that we did. So that is $15 million. There is a currency impact afterwards. So it's mostly these 2 and the pricing, there is nothing else. Because if you look at the constant currency revenue, as I said, for the company, we are in the middle of the guidance. We are at $1.780 billion, right? So the -- in constant currency terms, if I remove the $15 million impact, the revenues have gone up from $1.771 billion  to $1.780 billion. So that, in essence, reflects everywhere. So here, also, you will see the impact of the currency and the impact of the $15 million directly in Europe.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So excluding these factors, Europe would have been flat, would have been up?", "S. D. Shibulal", "It would have been right in the middle of the guidance or the upper end of the guidance. In fact, that's very important to remember because our guidance -- last quarter, our revenue was $1.771 billion. This quarter, if I look at the revenue in constant-currency terms, without considering the $15 million one-time impact, our revenue would have been $1.780 billion. Out of that, we lost $13 million because of currency, $15 million because of the one-time -- the loss of revenue, and we ended up at $1.752 billion. So if you eliminate those 2, we will end up at somewhere in the mid-to-upper end of the -- mid of the guidance.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So you explained on the earlier conference call that the pricing decline that you experienced was mostly due to business mix changes. As I look at the margin change in the quarter, it seems the quarter-to-quarter drop in your margin by 190 basis points, it seems to imply that something more fundamental besides mix hurt your margins versus your guidance. You probably received about 260 basis points of margin boost from the rupee depreciation. So is it accurate that your margin was hurt by the low expected pricing on like-for-like deals?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Not really. If you look at the operating margin, the decline was something around 190 basis points. In the beginning of the quarter, we clearly said we are hiring more people outside India to localize our operations, and we intended to hire some 600 -- 500 people in the year in the U.S. -- United States. And actually, we hired 700 employees in the first quarter, and we also said there could be a bunching up of visa costs in the first quarter as we need to apply when the window opens. Both of that had an impact of something around 160 basis points on the margin in the first quarter. To some extent, the pricing decline in the first quarter has been offset by the benefit of the currency regarding the first quarter. So that has not impacted the margin. The margins are impacted because of planned investments on hiring employees in the United States and also the bunching up of visa costs.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So but, Bala, let me just clarify, so your guidance assumed a 200 basis point decline and your actual decline was 190, so almost in line with guidance, but you received an unexpected rupee benefit of probably 260 basis points. And it seems  that your investments onshore were expected and already planned in your guidance. So it seems that there's another fundamental factor that wasn't assumed in your guidance that occurred in the quarter. And I guess I'm wondering, is that additional fundamental factor, is that the impact of effective utilization? Or is it the impact of a pricing effect on like-for-like deals? I guess, the reason I focused on that is if it was a business mix change that caused the pricing decline, then it seems the impact on the margins would not have been so significant.", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, it's like this. Rupee up -- depreciated by around 9.7%. That means there's a benefit of around 3.9% on the margin side. On a full-year basis, the pricing declined by something around 3.7%. So to some extent, the benefit we got from currency, which was not planned in the beginning of the quarter, was offset by a pricing decline we saw, which is also not planned in the beginning of the quarter. So the impact we are seeing on operating margin is due to planned investment of hiring people on-site in the U.S. and also because of the bunching up of visa costs. See, our pricing declined because of portfolio mix change. But at the end of the day, the blend of pricing is what matters. And if that declines, it has got an impact on the revenue and it has got an impact on the margins. So to some extent, the offset happened because of the currency.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right. So I'll move on to another margin-related question. It seems like you're going to make a decision on the wage inflation in the month of October. What are you assuming in your latest EPS guidance related to wage inflation? Are you -- is your guidance subject to change later in the year if you decide to move forward with salary hikes?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, we have not decided on the wage increase as of now. We will review it whenever we have a comfort on the environment, whenever we see some uptick in our -- in the revenue growth. Right now, we have not taken a view on that, and that is not part of the guidance.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. So, I mean, how are you evaluating that? I mean, are you intent on trying to provide a salary hike -- sorry, my voice keeps cutting out. I've got a cough. But are you trying to provide a salary hike if there's any way possible in your financial plan? Or are you feeling like you can make it through the next year competitively and in terms of a morale issue without actually following through with a salary hike?", "V. Balakrishnan", "I think we'll take a view. I think, particularly, if you look at the whole offshore industry, our per capita average employee cost is the highest both offshore and on-site. So there's no pressure on us to do even if some of the competition do some increase. That could be more like a catch-up. So we will review the situation. We'll see how the environment spans out. We'll see how the revenue growth kicks in. If we have greater comfort on that, probably we'll look at that. Otherwise, we can wait. I don't think there's a hurry to do it.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jesse Hulsing from Pacific Crest Securities.", "Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the mechanics of the deal delays that you're seeing? Are these push-outs primarily driven by more levels of sign-off and diligence required on the client side? Or are you seeing a pause in spending while clients try to figure out what is occurring on a macro level? And when do you see these deals, as they're being pushed out, finally coming back in and being executed?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So let me request B.G. to answer this. He's handling the financial services segment, where the impacts are much higher.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Thank you, Shibu. The financial services industry as such across capital markets, banking and insurance is definitely under cost pressure. In the current environment, we see mix of decisions being taken. On one hand, there is a relook at the operating model with respect to further vendor consolidation initiatives within our client environment, again, to consolidate the business, drive up volumes for the partners and look for discounts. So that is definitely happening in today's environment. Number two, in terms of other actions being taken in terms of reducing costs, if we relook at the programs, which can be put-off, and then we have seen some of the existing programs being further thought through before the deal is taken. They have not really clearly said no. But at the same time, they are not thinking of issuing yes  as well. Number two, they are also looking at infra, in fact, in the last 3 to 4 months, we have seen more opportunities, which are being put out in terms of outsourcing on the infrastructure management services side. The third element, which we see a little bit of slowdown is on the investments which were being planned on the regulatory and compliance. There are still investments being made, but at the same time, decisions are not being taken that quickly. These are some of the elements we are seeing. In Europe, particularly, again, a mixed reaction. In the Nordics, we have seen some of the banks looking at offshore initiatives, which was not there in the past. We have seen at least 2 of the large banks putting out bids for off-shoring. These are generic trend across all the banks, but we see it for the first time this sector in Nordics opening up. In Australia, particularly, we are seeing more efforts to drive work offshore as compared to the traditional model of doing more work on-site. So these are some of the activities we are observing in the financial services sector.", "Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Thanks, B.G. And just to dive a little bit deeper, I mean, if you look at financial services' growth for the Tier 1 outsourcing group over the last few quarters, it's been on fairly steep decline. Do you feel like the pie has shrunk to an extent because of secular challenges within the financial services industry? Or is this just a short-term blip in your view? I mean, what -- is growth going to come back? Or has it gotten much tougher for a multi-year cycle?", "B. G. Srinivas", "I would say in the near term, there are challenges the sector is going through. So I would not say there will be a reversal of this trend unless the macro environment stabilizes and then we see any kind of top line growth. If you take the capital markets, both trading volumes are down, M&A activity's down, so top line under pressure. The commercial wholesale banks, similar challenges on the top line. So we do not see a significant shift. There is definitely cut in spending. There's been a relook at the IT budget even midway during the year. So I would definitely agree to the fact that, yes, the overall pie is a bit shrunk. Question is, again, as the company goes through further optimization initiatives, there will be opportunities. It's not that there's no opportunities. But, yes, the overall size of the pie has definitely shrunk in the -- and that is something we'll continue to see in the next 2 quarters.", "Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And with the pie shrinking, are you seeing competitors get more aggressive with their pricing and getting more aggressive with terms to win business and stretching out deal links and lowering profit after tax? I mean, what's the competitive dynamic in an environment where there's really -- it sounds like there's not very much from a low-hanging fruit perspective?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Yes, on the traditional application development, maintenance, infrastructure, these are the areas competitive pressure is definitely high. And we are also making efforts to make sure our solution, which we provided, is equally competitive. In other words, we are trying to drive down effort to deliver the same programs. So that is definitely becoming much more acute in the current environment. At the same time, in the areas where there is still some spend in business analytics in areas where our clients are relooking at some of the applications to a more  cloud digital ecosystem, there is investment happening. These are areas where because of the very nature of the work, there is a little bit of pricing premium even in today's environment.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dave Koning from Baird.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "You guys talked a lot about margins already and when we do look at it though, margins this quarter were the lowest of the last 4 quarters despite the rupee being by far the most attractive in the last 4 quarters. And I guess I'm just wondering as we look out longer term, 2, 3, 4 years out, do you think margins are biased lower? Or do you think they can stay in this 28%, 29% range?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, see, on the margin front, a lot of things play out. One is the currency. But you also have other factors, other levers on the cost side, whether utilization or on-site-offshore mix or the business portfolio itself. So they all play out. You'll see how it evolves. Right now, we had a benefit. I think to some extent, the benefits are offset  because of the pricing moment. I think over a period of time, if the currency changes, we have to see how to utilize some of the other levers to make sure the margin is not impacted. And if we look at the past few years, we have seen that we are able to maintain the margins at different currency levels. So I think we have enough flexibility in the model to manage that in case the currency appreciates.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So it wouldn't be out of the question to think that margins could be stable going forward from here?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Even if you look the current year, we are talking about stable operating margin, which is a band of 50 to 100 basis points.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, okay. And then the other thing, there's some comments in the press about you potentially looking at bigger acquisitions. I'm just wondering if you would make an acquisition, is it something that we could expect to be accretive for the near term. I know the interest rates you get on the cash are so attractive. You're getting 9%, 10% type interest rate. That makes it a little harder for deals to be accretive. So I'm just wondering if that is a threshold for the acquisition.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, it depends on the kind of company we acquire. Our intention is to make sure any acquisition we do, it becomes EPS accretive at least one year down the line. And maybe cash EPS accretive at least a couple of quarters down the line. So we'll see. I mean, we are pursuing certain targets. We don't know whether it'll happen or not. It depends on the targets which we pursue and do actually.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mayank Tandon from Needham.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just had one quick question. This is for Shibu and Bala. The -- looking at to your portfolio of services, I think one area that you're missing relative to your peers is the health care segment just in terms of scale and capabilities. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what the initiatives are in terms of expanding that vertical over time? Do you build or do you buy, or is it some form of combination?", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G. again. The health care sector, again, we have formed a separate group, headed by Eric Paternoster, looking into the sector. A couple of things here, I mean, is one is we are also looking at specific platforms to offer to the sector in terms of entering. We are expanding current relationships in this sector. We are also actively looking at options for an organic growth in this sector. Currently, our footprint is relatively smaller compared to competition, but we are exploring on all the 3 dimensions in terms of expanding our footprint.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "In terms of some of the regulatory changes that are going on and impacting business, can you talk about what are some of the key areas that you're focused on? And is that starting to help your growth? Or are you just too small right now to really benefit from some of these changes?", "B. G. Srinivas", "On the regulatory challenges our clients are facing, particularly in financial services, there's always a challenge for our clients to fund some of these investments, which are required, and then the clients are definitely doing 2 things. One is they're trying to take costs out on the routines on the bank businesses and so that they will be in a better position to fund. On the other hand, we, at Infosys, we are looking at specific areas within regulatory frameworks where we have built accelerators to help our clients to implement these controls as well as specific systems. We have formed solutions for most of the current frameworks, the Basel III, Solvency II, in all of these areas. We are actually engaged working with several clients both in capital markets and in the banking industry, helping clients do this. At the same time, we have been able to help reduce the total cost of implementing these systems and frameworks because of the accelerators and, of course, because we are able to deliver this  with our offshore model. So on both those fronts, we are actively engaged. Yes, in terms of volume of business from services engaged in this particular area, it's not that material yet compared to the big volumes in the traditional application outsourcing. But definitely the traction is picking up. And we have specific practices with capability to understand not only our sectors' business, but more importantly, the regulations themselves, so that we can add value to our client business. So we are pretty active in this area.", "Mayank Tandon - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. But I was actually referring to also the health care side, especially the conversion from ICD-9 to ICD-10, if you have exposure on the payor side of health care insurance and is that going to be an incremental driver?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Our overall footprint in health care is small, while we are definitely investing in capability to address the regulatory as well. It is still too early to say how much of that we'll capitalize in the short term.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Price from BB&T Capital Markets.", "George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Just a couple of things I wanted to follow up on. You mentioned the delays and closures, postponement of ramp-ups. And I wanted to ask more specifically, what did you see with respect to these as the quarter progressed? I mean did they accelerate as the quarter went on? Were they fairly even? Have we seen pick up of this toward the end of the quarter? And maybe you could comment on that from a geographic and vertical basis as well.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So this is Shibu. As the quarter went on, we have seen a deterioration in the environment due to multiple events which happened, which we didn't see -- which we could not have predicted in the beginning of the quarter. So that has led to further lack of confidence, especially in the financial services segment during the quarter. And these events are all public events, so it has led to further lack of confidence in the financial sector. The large deals, if you look at some of the reports which came out, for example, if you look at the TPI Index, the number of large deals have come down quarter-on-quarter, number of billion-dollar-plus deals have come down drastically quarter-on-quarter. So the number of deals in the market, especially the large ones, which will give you large growth also have come down according to the reports. So both have happened during the quarter.", "George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And I know you commented on trends in the quarter in BFSI. And I know health care and Life Sciences are both relatively small parts of the business. But at least on a quarter-over-quarter basis they seem to be relatively weak versus other parts of the business. And I was just curious if you could comment was there any trend behind that, that you could comment on?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Life Sciences and health care both very much -- in Life Sciences, I think we have added numerous clients over the last few quarters, but we have large dependency on a few clients. Some of them are going through challenges due to patent case and other related issues, but we are investing more and more into Life Sciences. When I look at the future, I believe we should be fine. The same thing applies to health care. It is a smaller portfolio for us. So any change will drastically show up in that portfolio. The  verticals which are doing good for us and number one is manufacturing; number two is retail, which is stable and doing well for us. Financial services and health care, financial services is weak, and the energy and communications space, the ECS space are also competitively weak for us at this point in time.", "George A. Price - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then last question I know you've talked a little bit about the pricing decline impact, the main factors there, the portfolio shift and then the renegotiation impact. If I missed it, I apologize, but did you quantify the 2 of those? Or could you quantify that 2 of those, or at least give a rough kind of sizing of which one is having the bigger impact?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I would tend to believe that the portfolio shift is having a bigger impact because the pricing renegotiations which we are seeing are more sporadic than anything else. So I -- we do not quantify it, but I tend to believe that the portfolio shift has a bigger impact.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we will take one last question from Shankar AB (sic) [Shankar AVSB] from MarketStar Capital.", "Shankar AVSB", "My question is how does Infosys planning to use the $3.7 billion cash assets as a weapon for getting back growth even when the economy improves, say, 4 to 8 quarters from now? What I would like from you is you -- to understand what gives you the confidence that Infosys is fully ready to go on the offensive when the opportunities arise? Like you've seen pie shrinking, but when the pie expands, how will you ensure that you won't get choked out by competition?", "V. Balakrishnan", "No, no, look. We don't want to play more and more on the commodity space. It is very easy for us to use the cash to buy large services firm, but it could be commoditizing more of the business. The whole game is to look more on the product platform solutions space, which will give us a nonlinearity in the revenues and also help us to have better portfolio business. So the whole acquisition focus is to look at companies in the product platform solution space. If we find the right fit, we'll definitely do it. But again, we are not going to be in a hurry and do a wrong acquisition. We are very careful in our acquisition, and we'll do it only if it makes strategic sense for us to do it.", "Shankar AVSB", "A quick part 2 of the question would be how much revenue percentage or net profit percentage would you expect, let's say, 8 quarters from now from the products and platforms business that you're alluding to?", "V. Balakrishnan", "We have clearly laid out the medium- to long-term strategy of getting 1/3 of our revenues from that. We can't precisely tell you how much it will be 4 quarters down the line, 3 quarters down the line.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand over the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "So I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on this call and spending time with us. So we look forward to talking to you again over the next few days. Thanks, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we conclude this conference call. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."]}

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys. And over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Rina. Good morning, everyone, and a very warm welcome to all of you to discuss Infosys financial results for the quarter ended September 28, 2012.  I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York.", "Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. V. Balakrishnan and other members of the senior management team.  We'll start the proceedings of the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by the outlook for the year ending March 31, 2013. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'll now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. Thank you very much for joining the call. I'll give a brief update on the quarter and then hand it over to Bala for giving -- and add more color.", "It has been a decent quarter for us. Revenue grew by 2.6%, volume by 3.8%. Pricing's stable, marginally down by 0.2%, but mostly stable. Then good client relations, 39 new clients added, 14 of them in the BFSI segment.  And the growth has been all around. Top 5 has grown. Top 10 has grown. Top 25 has grown. Many of the clients are in the Fortune 500 space. We did an acquisition this quarter, the Lodestone acquisition, which will get consolidated as we go along. It has been closed.", "So if I look at the, any of the early indicators of Q2, it's a clear sign that the Infosys 3.0, which is in execution mode is starting to show results.  See, when we started this transformation, we were definitely in the -- we were in a different time. By the time the transformation was complete, we were in a challenging environment. That does impact our ability to realize early results from -- the early benefits from the transformation. But at the same time, if I look at Q2, if I look at the indicators, they all show sign that these -- those executions are starting to make real sense.", "If we go through that one by one, we have closed 6 large deals in Q2 -- 6 deals in the business and IT operation space, 2 of them more than $200 million, and both of them in the Infrastructure space, infrared deals.  In the consulting and system integration space, we have closed 8 business transformation deals in Q2, and many of them, really, reasonable size.", "In the Products and Platforms space, we have closed $100 million TCV -- close to $100 million TCV in Q2. Our total TCV we've been trying to close for $500 million. We are close to $0.5 billion.  So the result in all the 3 dimensions, whether it's in consulting and systems integration, business and IT operations or in Products and Platforms show signs that our execution is showing results.", "At the same time -- and also some of the news that we plan to make cloud mobility, strong client wins and analyst endorsements .  We are also seeing analyst endorsements during the quarter. There has been number of reports that are on the strategic direction we have taken, endorsing the fact that the approach towards an IT-led service offering is appropriate for the time, things like that.", "With all that, we are operating in a challenging environment. The environment between last quarter beginning when we talked to all of you and today, has not really changed. It is as challenging as it was in the beginning of last quarter. Of course, the details are known. We know why the U.S. environment is challenging, we know that the European environment is uncertain, financial services is going to turmoil. So all of these points are known, and we have not seen any material change in the environment between the beginning of last quarter and this quarter.", "We continue to hold our guidance at, at least 5% and the EPS at 2.97% adjusting for the client's currency movement.", "Our visibility metrics have not changed. Usually, we see 95% in the beginning of the quarter -- for the quarter, and 65% for the year -- in the beginning of the year. So if I actually recompute that for this point in time, it's about 80%, 85% -- 85% to 87%. So we still have to catch up with the remaining revenue during the next 6 months.", "Now we are very confident about our strategic direction. The early indicators are very positive, and we are really confident about our strategic direction. We clearly believe that the platform which we are building will perform extremely well when the environment gets better.  We are investing for the future. We are investing into products and platforms. So for example, we have filed a number of patents during the quarter and over the last 6 months.  We are investing into consulting and system integration. We have done the acquisition -- strategic acquisition. We are investing into Europe. Europe is a strategic market for us. While Europe is undergoing turmoil, we believe that because our revenue from Europe as a percentage is comparatively smaller, it is a market with great opportunities for us.  We are investing in the people. We have given a compensation increase of 6% average offshore and 2% to 3% average on site during this -- we have just announced this; offshore will become effective this quarter and on site will become effective next quarter.", "So to summarize. We have seen positive signs to indicate that our strategic direction is yielding results and the execution is starting to yield results. We are operating in a equally challenging environment as it was in the beginning of last quarter. Our visibility metrics remained the same. We still -- visibility for the year is, at this point, about 85% to 87%. We still have a catch up to do.  We are very confident about our future and investing for the future. We are investing by creating intellectual property, by creating capacity but through acquisitions, as well as we are investing into our people.  So while I believe there will be challenges in the short term, I clearly believe that the long-term will be fine.", "With that, now let me hand over to Bala.", "V. Balakrishnan", "Good morning, everyone. It has been a decent quarter, looking at the environment where we are in. The revenues grew by 2.9% sequentially. Our EPS grew by around 5%, sequentially. To look at the gross margin. Gross margin came down by something around 1.6% during the quarter from 39.5% to 38% or so.  And this was clearly admitted when we gave our guidance during the last quarter, because we felt that during the year, our cost could slightly grow up when the growth comes down, so we have factored in that. But if you look at the yearly guidance, we have retained that 5% guidance for the revenue, but on the EPS side, we had made sure that the impact of currency is felt. So the guidance has been revised from 3.03% to 2.97%. However, we were able to absorb the increase in wages, which we are announcing from October 1 for all of the employees offshore in India and some of the employees outside India.  So after absorbing that wage increase, we are certainly able to retain our EPS guidance for the year, because we are able to pull out some of the cost levers we have.", "So for the quarter, the operating margin came down by 1.6%, basically because some of the cost went up.  The currency has been neutral in Q2 as compared to Q1. On a net margin, we have seen a slight uplift, mainly because other income went up.  Our effective tax rate continues to be at the level of 28%,  29%. We are able to get a yield of 9.6% on all our cash [indiscernible] during the quarter.", "Our DSO days are 65 days, and we have a hedging position of close to $1.1 billion.  We view that currency could remain volatile for some time to come, so we're returning our policy of hedging for the short term. We're not changing that. And we added some 10,420 employees during the quarter. We guided for 9,000. Our attrition is under control, it's up 15%. Our CapEx guidance remains the same.  So overall, I think we have done well during the quarter. That's [ph] for the plan we initiated in the beginning of the quarter.  For the full year, we are retaining the guidance on the revenue side. Of course, it requires us to deliver some 3.6%, 3.7% sequential growth in the next 2 quarters. We believe it's doable, looking at the client conversation that we have and also looking at the clients' budget.  We believe it's doable, that's why we are retaining the guidance on the revenue side.", "On the EPS side, we made a small correction, mainly to account for currency, because in the beginning of Q2, when we gave the guidance for the full year, we assumed the rupee-dollar at INR 55 for rest of the year. Now sale of the rupee has appreciated. We characterize with past [ph] INR 53, so the closing rate at the end of Q2. So the -- except for the adjustment for rupee-dollar variation, the EPS guidance too remains the same in spite of the rate increase.", "So I think with this, I will conclude. We'll open up the floor for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "My first question here is you talked about revenue guidance and how it's looking at 3.7% sequential growth the next 2 quarters. And, I guess, your impression is, obviously, that it's doable. Can you give us some more color on that? I mean, are using some large deal ramps? Are they contracts that you have visibility on? What gives the Street more confidence that the revenue's actually going to accelerate in the tough macro environment?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So at this point, and then usually in our inflation, and visibility of about 85% to 87%. We will always have a catch up to do during the quarter, because we now have 100% visibility at this point in time through the year. And we have not changed our visibility metrics. This quarter, there have been, actually, substantial large deal wins. One, which is in the public space, with Harley-Davidson, which we closed. It's a $200 million plus deal we entered a certain leg. Another deal, which we will not disclose the client name, we've said that again, $200 million plus deal intercepted [ph]. Both of them included actually taking more people. There are 4 other deal wins including India Post and Ministry of Corporate Affairs in India. All substantial, large wins. In the transformation space, there are 8 wins. And on the Products and Platforms space, we have booked $100 million TCV. Being said all this, I also said that we are operating in a challenging environment, but based on where we are today, based on the visibility metrics which we are looking at, based on some of the deals, which we have closed this year, we do not feel the need to move our convenience in the guidance. It is a statement of fact as we see it today.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question, on the margin front, is we look at the -- what's the impact of the acquisition? And is it -- is that built into guidance? And why did costs spike in the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So there is -- the impact of acquisition is not factored in the revenue nor the margin, because it's not closed. It will get closed only next week. We have seen less buying because of the inflation [ph] of contracting cost. We have -- have a need for subcontracting in certain parts of the organization, and we have seen the need for sub-contracting costs, and that has led to the change, [indiscernible].", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And so just on the acquisition, my last question, just as a follow-up to that one.  What -- I mean, can you give us a rough estimate of what the impact would be on the margin front?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We will do that next quarter, because integration will only start after we close, because according to European law, the integrations will start only after we close. We are waiting for [indiscernible] to spin [ph] from Germany, which has now come. So next week, we will probably close it, and then we will consider that for the next quarter guidance.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so margin profile is dilutive, correct?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There will be some impact, but please, remember, they are a $200 million corporation, we are $7 billion corporation.", "Operator", "The next question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Bala, can you comment on your decision to submit your resignation? Just give us some background on that. And was that kind of under some sort of a long-term planning process?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I want to clearly state this, Bala has not resigned. He has not submitted a resignation. Bala is one of the finest [indiscernible] that this country and everyone else has seen. He has done an excellent job as the CFO of Infosys. In fact, he was able to receive numerous awards during his time here. He also started looking after the business portfolios about one year back, right Bala? One year back -- he took over 3 business portfolios, 1 year back, all 3 of them strategic to Infosys. Infosys BPO, Finacle and India, all 3 are extremely strategic to Infosys. India, I talked about 2 wins this quarter, which I think he has very, very similar guidance factoring them. BPO is growing at 18% rate. The company is growing at 5%, connectively, it's the flagship product which we have. So he has stepped out and will pass on his role as the CFO to Rajiv Bansal. He has not resigned. And Bala, do you want to add?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Nothing, Moshe [ph]. You can't escape me, so I'll [indiscernible].", "Operator", "The next question is from Dave Koning from Baird.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I guess, first of all, just -- I wanted to pursue on the margin side. We're getting about a half year impact this year of the appreciated rupee and about a half year impact of the wage increases. So is it fair to say that next year, when we have a full impact of those things, assuming that the rupee doesn't move back, doesn't depreciate back -- is it fair to say that next year, when we have a full year of those impacts that margin should go down a bit further next year?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, if you assume the world is going to remain static next year, also, if we don't  see the growth, what you say is right. The whole thing we are doing is to make sure that when the growth environment becomes better, we are well positioned to take that growth. Of course, this year, you'll see the impact of -- which is only for half year, next year, it'll come for the full year. And again, currency is going to be too volatile. I mean, it's not going to be one way, because even if you look at the recent trade data of India, the trade it's something around $18 billion a month. And, of course, the oil price is still high. India is still fighting the high inflation. So I think currency will move both ways. It's not going to be one way. And we are going to see volatility, and we have to make sure we do proper hedging to minimize the impact.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. So there's not necessarily a multi-year margin decline necessarily if revenue growth can come back?", "V. Balakrishnan", "I don't think so. I think the whole idea of doing all this is to make sure we are well prepared. And I think growth will come back. I mean, there's no -- we have seen this kind of a downturn even in the past, that is 2000 or 2008. And in terms of spending, do have comebacks. I mean, we thought bringing efficiency, we thought using technology, corporate cannot grow, so spending will come back, and we'll be right there when it comes.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up question is really on the other income line. It was quite a bit higher this quarter. And I think on the last call, you talked about a $25 million gain in there. Maybe you can just give us a little context about what you think that line will be in Q3?", "V. Balakrishnan", "It depends, because we have seen a sharp momentum in the currency during the quarter. If you remember, it was something around INR 55 per $1 in the beginning of the quarter. At the end of the quarter, it's almost close to INR 53. That means something around 4% to 5% appreciation in rupee. That's why all of our hedges gives some positive impact. That's why you saw big gain. So if you take -- it depends on how the rupee is going to move. We have the hedging position close to $1.1 billion. Our policy is to hedge for next 2 quarters at any point in time. So it depends on the currency movement because most [indiscernible] 5% by gain. We have to see what the impact is.", "Operator", "The next question is from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could remind us what your gross hiring targets were at the beginning of the year, and then how you're progressing both on the freshers and on the lateral side?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We're progressing as planned. Our number for the year was 35,000. We recruited 10,000 people gross this year. This quarter, the gross number was 35,000. I think we're on track. Our on-site number for the year was close to 2,000. I think we are on track for that also.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And how many were they -- you mentioned you had to hire more contractors. Is that just a dislocation in certain skill -- high-propensity skill sets or certain geographies or...", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, it's a need to have certain skills in consulting and system integrations, because of new skills, as well as the new program starting.", "Operator", "The next question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company.", "There is no response from this line, we'll move on to the next question.", "The next question is from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just wanted to inquire about your revenue trends in the -- among banking clients. You've had pretty soft quarter-to-quarter revenue growth among your banking client segment in each of the past 2 quarters. And so I've got a couple of questions on that. To what extent has pricing concessions hurt your revenue growth among banks in the past 2 quarters? And then should we expect revenues among banks to turn the corner as we move into the back half of the fiscal year?", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G., in the last 2 quarters, again, there have been few cases where there were discounts in a couple of banks, including in capital markets. But apart from that, it's not a secular trend. We are not seeing that kind of [indiscernible] across-the-board. This quarter, on the services alone, that's in Q2, we had a sequential growth of 2.2%. So the revenue, while it's still slower, it's definitely picking up. The sector is definitely going through one of the most challenging times, so there's a lot of effort we put on cost-cutting measures, which the banks are doing and there's also an effort to conduct further on the consolidation approach between our clients. So we are seeing some of these initiatives moving into growth and in some areas within our client base. At the same time, there are challenges. There's going to be a significant cuts for -- there as we move into the fiscal year, which is going to start in Jan. While the budgets are not closed on, it's still early for that, but early indications are there will be cuts to budgets. So we need to closely watch this, but at the same time, we are preparing ourselves for taking proactive proposals to our clients to help them in cost-cutting measures, in simplification efforts. And also, even in current environment, there are pockets that in this case are being met. Risk and compliance is one area, the other area is client-centric applications. So these are areas where there is some -- more of spend -- the position we spend, it includes environment and we are capturing a part of that as well.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right. And B.G., just to follow up on that, I mean, are the -- is the worst of the impact of the price concessions now behind you? And then the second part to the follow-up is to the extent that you're able to drive better growth going forward in the banking clients segment, is that more likely to come from new client wins or from existing clients starting to spend a little -- at a better pace? So the first part is, what's happening is the worst of the pricing over? And then what's the key driver of growth going forward, new clients or existing clients?", "B. G. Srinivas", "It's not just about pricing. There are other reasons why there was revenue ramp down in the last 2 quarters, including the ramp down. So to some degree, yes, that is over and behind us. Of course, nothing stops clients from coming back on new requests, but for now we aren't seeing that. So and to answer your first part of the question, the answer is yes. The second part of the question, yes while we will continue to add new clients to the portfolio, we added 14 in the last quarter, we still see opportunities between our existing client base where the revenue growth is happening even in essence, some of our top lines did grow last quarter. So we focus on both.", "We will happily wage existing relationship. It's still a large revenue base we have, so we will continue to focus on both the trends in terms of revenue growth.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right. And then one other question just to broaden this, are there other verticals where we might see some meaningful effect from price concessions? Or was the -- the price concessions and financial services more of sort of an isolated set of events in your overall view?", "S. D. Shibulal", "If we look at our Q4 to Q1, revenue product really dropped 33.7%. Now from Q1 to Q2, it has remained somewhat stable, 42%. We are not seeing a secular pricing negotiation trend. We are not seeing a secular trend on pricing negotiation spend. We are seeing sporadic ones, which is very much in line with maybe 5% more than what we would have seen in a normal situation. Last quarter, revenue product really doubled, so it's the reflection of the portfolios in the last quarter, [indiscernible] in the recent portfolio dropped, slightly dropped. So it's a reflection of the portfolio shift also. So at this point in time, generally, when I look at it, I see sporadic pricing and renegotiations, but we expect it to be stable looking at where we are today.", "Operator", "The next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the gross margin's trend in terms of providing some color on the forces of impact of breaking down pricing versus the rupee, versus the wage hikes, what the impact is, say, in the upcoming quarter or the most recent quarter, but really the upcoming quarter? But more importantly, is this the right gross margin structure going forward or do you see the ability to recover some of those forces?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, all these have the ability to recover. See, I can always say that we have that high aspiration in the operating margin side. We want to retain our operating margins. In weak times when some of the factors were these 2, particularly this year, since we hired more people than required, it is hurting us on the accreditation side, so we are carrying close to maybe around $500 million of cost because of non-billable employees sitting in the system, that is hurting us. Probably when the growth comes back, we'll have the biggest lever for us because when the utilization improves, you will look better. And all these will have more impact. Like currency, we don't know how it's going to move. Utilization is a function of growth. So growth is the biggest lever we all have and if that comes back, our cost of sale will get administered and we will get back the margins. So actually, I don't see any changing of our margin profile. These are all short-term things you go through when the amendment grows against you. And that is where you see the impact.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But if we you look out the next couple of quarters, it seems like you're assuming fairly muted gross margins. Are you assuming that the gross margins stay at these levels?", "V. Balakrishnan", "The next 2 quarters, we see other impact because we are giving a wage increase. That is why I said operating margin on a full year basis could decline by 200 basis points. The wage increase will be there. We're also using some of the levers to get some efficiency on the cost side. So net-net, I think it will be reaching a range from what we have seen in the second quarter. And for the full year, probably it would be a decline. If the growth comes back up, probably some of the decline, we can bring it back.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Grossman from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if I could just go back to a question that was asked earlier, but maybe ask it more broadly. And my recollection was that you had certain sequential headwinds in the top line in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter that ranged from the earlier discussion about pricing to large customer, consolidation, if you will, and runoff, as well as a cancelation in Europe in the first quarter. Number one, am I remembering this right? And if I am, if you aggregate all those things, how should we think about the sequential headwinds diminishing as we go into the second half of the year? Or do we really not get that benefit at all, in fact, in a stable environment sequentially?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So actually what we know the Q4 into Q1 actually lowered the base, right? We are now trying to climb out of that base. I am hoping that, that will [indiscernible]. Because when the base comes down, then when -- our growth is on the base. Is that the question you were asking?", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. So, I guess, what I'm asking is did the base -- the headwinds that were pressuring the base sequentially, whether it be pricing, customer, lots of customer momentum with certain large clients or the large deal that was canceled in the first quarter, when you aggregate all that, is the pressure from those events behind us so that we're in more of a steady-state mode to grow sequentially entering the third quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, I think I'm not expecting a similar event to happen unless something really goes wrong with the environment. So in that sense, we are in a steady state to start a new trajectory. That is correct.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And can you give us a sense for how much of a headwind those items were in the fourth quarter or, I guess, in the first and the second quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "$0.26. We didn't [Audio Gap] in the first quarter. Hold on one second.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Actually, Shibu, what I was asking was...", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, no. According to Q4, in Q4, if you look at it in Q4, we grew by 1.9% and in Q1, we delivered 1.1% in dollar terms. If we will include 3 of last year, we were 18 06 [ph]. And then we dropped to a 17 71 to 17 52 [ph], so now we are back at 17 97.[ph]", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But when you aggregate all those factors, was it a 1% sequential headwind to growth, was it 2%? Is that a number that you can -- that you have?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We did actually more than that because the growth in Q4 was 1.9% and in Q1, it's around 1.1%, so that's a the total of 3%. But it is not a percentage computation because when the base goes down, you are growing from that base, right? So -- if the big order [ph] does not happen, that's a completely different number you'll end up with.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I see. And let me ask you just one other question, just philosophically in terms of growth and profitability. Historically, you've been kind of very consistent in terms of where you've kind of targeted the margins vis-\u00e0-vis growth. Given all the changes that are going on in the company, should we think differently about that going forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So from an aspiration perspective, nothing has changed. I'm very, very clear, from an aspiration perspective, nothing has changed. We believe that we shall create high-quality growth. We shall grow over industry average. We still have one of the leading industry margins. There's no doubt about the aspiration. See [indiscernible] aspiration leads to new strategies. And those strategies lead to execution, executions leads to results. We also believe that the strategic directions we have taken, the influence we have seen are creating a balanced portfolio. Operating on both cost to revenue side of the client, having a strong Products & Platforms business. All of this is meant to meet our aspirations. To have high-quality growth, right, as I defined. The result, when we --  with all these aspirations, we're in a different time, we're in a different time today, the environment is very challenging. That means the ability to realize the results from those transformations are definitely lower trend, it will take some time. So in the short term, you will see choppy environment. You will see bleeps, but we clearly believe that our own $3 [ph] strategy, and now that we are in execution, in the long-term should deliver our aspirations. There are no guarantees, right? But we believe that it really shall deliver our aspiration of a high-quality growth.", "Operator", "The next question is from Shashi Bhusan from Prabhudas Lilladher.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "So how has the visibility improve for the back ended growth today compared to where it was at the beginning of the year? Because you have mentioned that the [indiscernible] our growth is going to be back-end loaded?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I clearly stated that the environment has not changed a lot contrary to this quarter. We had a decent quarter, there's no doubt. But to me volatilityis expected, which is ongoing in the developed markets. The environment, there's no material change in the environment. There's no material change in the environment, in the regulatory environment, the beginning of last quarter and this quarter.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "And so if you struck a few deals over the last 4, 5 months, [indiscernible] taking clients employed on our payroll, do our current employee cost include full impact of were [ph] the same or will there be some spillover in the next quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "The number is quite small and employees we have taken over is already included. There may be a few more, but the numbers are quite small.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And for our Harley deal that we have signed last quarter, you spoke in the morning conference call that we are talking to 3 more clients who are utilizing the same asset. So at what stage of the negotiation are [indiscernible] for those views? And if you could give some more color on the size and the vertical as well?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Harley deal, where are we on -- I said utilization across clients? [indiscernible] will respond to that.", "Unknown Executive", "So the Harley deal, we are building at D.C. and Milwaukee as part of the deal. And the idea is that we will be using that development center for top other clients in Wisconsin as well as in the greater Chicago area. So from -- and the investment in the CapEx that we will be putting into that will actually be properly distributed. But for the deal itself, there are certain specific investments that we have to make ranging from people rebadge to certain asset purchases and top grades, et cetera, and creating a development center.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. So my question pertains that has all investments is captured in the current margin profile? Or is it going to be evenly spread over the next few quarters?", "Unknown Executive", "It's evenly spread over the next few quarters. It is a transition that is going on and -- on the larger infrastructure part of the deal. But for the application, development work, et cetera, it's already kicked off which requires very minimal investments. So there is not necessarily a complete offset, but some amount of it. But we do expect the margins from this particular deal to continue to be below company average for a while until we actually build that up to some attrition, which should happen in the fourth quarter next year.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "And so you spoke in the morning conference call about 3 more clients who we are talking to. Do you float these assets, so at what stage of negotiation and in terms of size and vertical, if you can give some more color?", "Basab Pradhan", "Yes. This is Basab Pradhan. So we have a pretty big pipeline, not just 3 or 4 deals of large outsourcing opportunities. Many of them, I'd say maybe 1/3 of them include infrastructure outsourcing. And the expectations of our clients in the way we are dealing with these don't always include asset utilization like the way I shall describe the Harley deal was.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "[indiscernible] in the Harley assets that we are building?", "Basab Pradhan", "Sorry, can you state your question again, please?", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "So what I was saying that for the Harley assets that we have really -- so you are talking to 3 more clients in utilizing those same assets or [indiscernible]?", "Unknown Executive", "Yes. So these are not the -- the large deals that Basab is talking about are not going to leverage or capitalize the assets we're building for Harley. But we have 3 other -- not 3 -- but some clients in the greater Chicago area that will be leveraging this capacity and investments that we're making.", "Operator", "The next question is from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC", "Shibu now you gave a very good keynote at Oracle World (sic) [Oracle OpenWorld],  very impressive. I had a few questions from a strategic perspective and what our research is indicating, every indication, our research is showing that next year will be worse than this year in terms of IT spend. And it seems to us the strategy that Infosys is taking on needs some alteration. I think the focus on investment should be more on demand generation and competitive wins. Are there any discussions within your company? See, you guys have portfolios. What I'm trying to understand is are there any discussions happening within your company maybe to replace or change the board?", "Unknown Executive", "No. Change what?", "Unknown Executive", "Change of board.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC", "The Board, the Board of Directors at Infosys?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Look, Trip, we have a strategy and we are going after that strategy. We believe that the industry has got bigger challenges in terms of commoditization and scalability. What you say is right. The global economic indicators show some weakness but it doesn't mean the IT spending is going to come down. Because if you talk to any large client today, they are talking about bringing in efficiency, bringing in innovation. And there are also some of the regulated things which are driving the IT investment. You could see a short-term impact this year because of what is happening in the global economic environment. I think we are also seeing some stability in the environment. And we believe that the growth will come back and we are positioning ourselves for that. You don't change the Board just because you have a few bad quarters.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Shashi Bhusan from Prabhudas Lilladher.", "Shashi Bhusan - Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd., Research Division", "So you have spoken about margin levers in place to attain our guidance of 200 basis point decline for the full year. Now if you look at H1, FY '13 in the first half, we are at constant percent operating margin, which is already 200 basis points lower than where we were in FY '12. Now we have a headwind from wage hike, [indiscernible] running, project transition cost. So can you please elaborate on some of the tailwinds that could offset these?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, we have to improve the utilization. We have to focus more on revenue productivity. We have to bring some more efficiency on the operations side. We always have been talking about some end levers on the cost side, which we have to use. It may be utilization, it may be on-site offshore mix, it may be revenue productivity. So we are trying to use all of those levers to make sure the impact is minimized in the second half. We can't get into granular details of how much basis points we are going to get to [indiscernible] to offset, but characteristically, we are working together to make sure we get those efficiency to fund the incremental costs.", "Operator", "The next question is from Vikram San [ph] from Swastika Investment.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. I would just like to know if we're looking for some more acquisitions? Then it feels -- which feels we have more [indiscernible]. I mean you want more [indiscernible]. And the second question pertains to your client, and if you can shed some light on the project deals your clients have opted this quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "The first question I heard it was about acquisition. We have done one, which is very strategic to us. It's in the area of consulting and in Europe more than in the areas of investment. Can you please repeat your second question?", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. And if you can just shed some light on the project deals your clients have opted this quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, I think there is no change in the project duration trend. They do not like -- the ITs in the past, they are similar to what they have in the past.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. And just like to know if you are looking for some more acquisitions, in which space you are more interested?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We'll continue to focus on our visibility in the offset within Products & Platforms in terms of public service, country penetration, any other countries across the globe. Then in Life Sciences, so there are identified areas which are in line with our strategic direction.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mitali Ghosh from Bank of America.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, a couple of things. One, Shibu, you discussed in the morning to do that your top 5, 10 and 25 clients have grown much faster than the company at between 6% and 8%. And this is basically -- what this reflects is that, I guess, some of your other existing clients have probably grown much slower or perhaps declined. So what I wanted to understand is that your current top 5, 10 and 25, if these are sort of more recent deal wins, what is the kind of stage of ramp up at which we are and therefore, is there much more runway for them? And secondly, decline that you have seen in some of the existing clients perhaps over the last couple of quarters as well. Are we somewhere nearing the bottom for those?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, Mitali, I want to make a correction to the morning statement because actually after that statement, we went back and looked at the number [indiscernible], we've caught some [indiscernible] in the morning so I want to give you the numbers to correct the morning one. Our top 5 grew by 4.8%. Top 10, grew by 3.1%. Top 25, grew by 2.6%, top 50 by 3.5%. All the others and even top 50, 1% and on -- so that averages to 2.6%.", "So it's a balanced growth. That is a balanced growth. Our top clients came down by about 1%, that's why the $300 million client went down. So it is balanced both across. And I had a slightly different set of numbers in the morning. But from point line, what I said is right in the morning.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, so just from that stage, like you said the trend line perspective, I guess, top 5 for instance has grown slightly faster and there has been shown, I guess, in the doc side. So are we -- is there -- are these clients which you have added recently, would you see a lot more room for growth and the clients which had declined obviously at the bottom list. I guess some of the other financial services clients in any case?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the clients move up-and-down but one interesting number I have is the number of million dollar clients. These are largely clients who we have added recently and that has gone up to $4.13 million. If I'm right, I don't have in front of me, but if I am right, I think there are 10 new clients in the $10 million range, which means that our new clients are definitely growing.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I mean just -- sorry to pursue, but the clients which have declined in the last few quarters and maybe you want to comment on those? I mean, do you think some of this -- do you think some of this have reached the bottom now?", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G. No secular trend. The quarter-on-quarter movement for some clients could be a put on, but in terms of previous ramp downs, which we saw in Q4 and Q1, that has definitely, what I have said, we have not seen any serious ramp downs in the last quarter.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just 2 quick questions for Bala. As you said, you can't escape us either. One is on the product side that has obviously seen some decline this quarter, and that this can be a lumpy business. But if you could give some comments on how you see the outlook over the next few quarters?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Well, I can escape you either. See, overall, we are seeing that the good trend in some of the markets, but in some of the markets like Europe needs to improve over the next few quarters. The deal cycles are longer. And also, the different revenue model in terms of pay-per-use kind of thing becoming more prevalent in some segments. So overall, we need to watch few more quarters. Otherwise right now, we see here we're pretty much on target for this year.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So next several quarters, you would at least expect it to be somewhat stable?", "V. Balakrishnan", "We need to watch and comment about it after few quarters.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right, sure. And one last question in terms of BPO, which saw a bit of decline, what is that looking like?", "V. Balakrishnan", "Yes, it's on here. The decline is very marginal. But it's because of the fact that the clients that we acquired in the last quarter are now in a transition stage. But having said that, the growth is fairly robust. This is clearly the first half, the most competitive fiscal of last 6 months of last year, the growth is about 17.5%. So good client acquisitions this quarter. We have had 5 new clients joining in. And we believe that they would all start to get transitioned in the third and fourth quarter.", "Operator", "As there are no further questions from the participants. I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us in this call. We look forward to talking to you again during the course of the quarter or meeting you at one of the conferences. Thanks, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this conference call.

Happy New Year to all and a very warm welcome to discuss Infosys financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2012.Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the proceedings with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2013. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.I'll now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.S. D. ShibulalGood morning everyone. My best wishes for a great 2013. We have performed well in Q3. In dollar terms our revenue grew sequentially by 6.3%, including the Lodestone acquisition that was completed this quarter. Excluding the acquisition, our revenue grew by 4.2%. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.76 as against $0.75 last quarter. Our growth was broad-based. We added 53 new clients in Q3. We won eight large deals amounting to $730 million. Four of those were in U.S., three in Europe, one in India. They include new client engagements as well as renewal and expansions on existing programs. Our win rate in the large deal win segment accelerated in Q3 as clients leveraged our strong solutions and differentiated offerings in this space.That is regarding the bids space. The business and IT operations space. Consulting and systems integration has done well this quarter. It grew by 15% sequential in Q3, 8% sequential without including Lodestone. In the production platform and solutions business, our contract value increased from $485 million at the end of Q2 to $603 million at the end of Q3. We have launched a total of 20 products and platforms over the last year and half, sold them to over 70 unique clients so far.In Q3 itself we have 13 new wins and on boarded eight new clients. We are seeing stability in pricing where continued quarterly movement would change in business mix. Our growth came in spite of adverse impact of super storm sandy on billable days, longer than normal furloughs in December, and client specific ramp downs. We worked very closely with our clients and their business priorities through December to mitigate the impact of these events. During the quarter, as I said, we completed acquisition of Lodestone aimed at increasing the momentum of our consulting service as well as strengthening our presence in continental Europe.This contributed approximately $39 million in Q3 revenue for November and December. Even though we are in the early stages of integration, it is on track and progressing well. We have already secured our first win which is under the single umbrella of Infosys and Lodestone. While we have done well in Q3, the overhang of uncertainty continues in the broader economic environment. In U.S. -- U.S. is working amidst fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling issues. European nations are continuing to battle their sovereign debt. Emerging markets are witnessing a slowdown of growth.In my conversations with global clients, it is clear that they believe that while the worst is over, some of these events can impact their business prospects in a manner difficult to predict. Their ability in gauging the full impact of these events on their business is affecting their confidence in taking spending decisions even though they have huge amount of cash reserves. This has resulted in longer conversion time for programs and programs wins into actual revenues. Early signs indicate flat to declining IT spend in the next year\u2019s budget. We expect a better indication of this by the end of Jan of mid of Feb.The fundamentals of our business have remained intact. We believe that technology has surely taken center stage in the business of our clients, especially in difficult times like this. Today technology is at the heart of many of their business decisions whether in rationalizing their cost structure, increasing productivity, standardizing and simplifying processes, expanding into new markets, or in launching new sales channels. And most importantly, remaining competitive.We continue to believe that our full suite of solution and service capability across transformational, operational innovation, will hold us in good faith in the long term. This is true even as we continue to navigate short term challenges due to the uncertainty in the market place. Now let me give you some color on the industry verticals.In financial services, our clients expect their business prospects to be muted at least for the next one to two years. This can lead to strong focus on cutting costs through layoffs, elimination of less profitable business, monetizing assets and vendor consolidation in IT and operations. The shrinkage being witnessed at the industry level is manifesting itself in declining 2013 budgets for most of our large clients.Meanwhile, we expect some areas such as customer-centric applications, risk management and government to continue to see robust spending and we are focusing on capitalizing such opportunities.The retail and CPG is seeing investments towards digitization, efficiency enhancement, SAP rollout, trade promotions and big data. There is also increased focus on vendor consolidation and move to a managed services model. We had good wins across the entire roster in Q3, especially in managed services deals, transformation deals and proactive solutions. We see good market traction with our platforms like BrandEdge, ComplianceEdge and ProcureEdge in this vertical.Coming to manufacturing, clients are focusing on long term savings as well as increasing the effectiveness of their operations through data mining, analytics and business intelligence. We expect short term growth to come from America as the US manufacturing sector has seen a resurgence driven by higher automation, falling energy prices and rising labor costs as well. Clients in Europe are discussing transformational engagement through the financial troubles in the region, while cautious of decision making. In effect, we are seeing interest in platforms and solutions with lower CapEx.Within the manufacturing vertical in Q3, we had multiple wins across the gamut of transformation, operation and innovation.The energy and utility and communication services space, we have initiated new programs and ramped up engagement with clients that were added in recent quarters. At the industry level, we are seeing spend being driven by ERP-led transformation, technology and infrastructure modernization, enhancement of Cloud technologies in enterprise. We are focusing on increasing our wireless media and entertainment and cable business as the traditional wireline segment continues to see challenges.Our Finacle business grew by 8.9% in Q3. Our BPO business grew by 15.6% sequentially in Q3. As you are aware, Finacle is a product business and is representative of the non-effort based model that we are focusing on as part of our strategy, Infosys 3.0. This quarter we added 8,400 new employees. We have strengthened our engagement with employees, instituted offshore and onsite wage increases and are looking at promoting 6,000 to 9,000 employees in Q4.So looking ahead, we\u2019re gaining confidence due to a strong pipeline of large deals, especially in the application development, maintenance and infrastructure management. Clients are embarking on restructuring their IT and operations spend. The continental Europe region also present a strong pipeline of large deals as they move towards managed services model. We believe that our strong brand, coupled with our execution engine, enables us to remain competitive and capitalize on any growth opportunities. We continue to remain focused on delivering strong returns even in uncertain and challenging environment, keeping in mind the interests of all of our stakeholders.Now before I hand it off to Rajiv for details on the financial performance, I would like to thank you all for your support. I have met many of you through the course of the year. We are encouraged with a positive feedback we are receiving in response to the execution of our strategies.Thank you. Now let me hand it off to Rajiv.Rajiv Bansal", "Good morning everyone. Let me take you through the financial performance. Q3 has been good for us. Our revenues in US dollar terms we were 6.3% including Lodestone and 4.2% without Lodestone sequentially. Our operating margin in the quarter was 25.7%, including Lodestone and at 26.1% excluding Loadstone. We have done well this quarter despite the negative environmental headwinds for the [phase] during the early part of the quarter. We are also able to maintain our operating margins despite the base increases that we rolled out \u00a0for offshore in Q3.Our pricing has gone up by 1.8% during the quarter, primarily because of change in business mix. CSI, consulting and system integration, as a percentage of revenue increased from 30% to 31.2% in Q3. We see pricing to be stable as we go along. Volumes have increased by 1.5% during the quarter. Our integration with Loadstone is going well. I had mentioned earlier, we expect this acquisition to be EPS accretive over the next 18 months. We would have an additional quarterly charge of approximately $8 million on account of deferred compensation and amortization of intangible assets.As we mentioned earlier, we plan to institute the onsite wage increase of 2% to 3% in Q4. This will impact our operating margin by approximately 1% in Q4. In terms of exchange rate the average rupee has appreciated by 0.5% over the last quarter. We have assumed a 54.50 rate as an exchange rate for Q4 purposes. On hedging front, we have hedges of 1.1 billion as of date.We continue to generate strong cash from operations. You would be happy to note that our operating cash flow is at 103% of net margins. Our DSO is at 62 days as against DSO of 55 days last quarter in spite of it being a challenging quarter. Though our Q3 has been an exceptionally good quarter, challenges remain in terms of time to deal closures and ramp up. We usually have visibility of 95% to 96% at the beginning the quarter, and Q4 is traditionally a soft quarter for us. We need a sequential growth of 2.8% to achieve our earlier guidance of 5%. Our revised guidance including Loadstone now stands at 6.5%. Our EPS guidance remains unchanged at $2.97. Though there are challenges, we remain cautiously optimistic about meeting our guidance.With that I would like to open it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery ScottMy first question here is just, I think \u00a0in the quarter it sounded like the commentary was cautious on the quarter in general, coming from management. I wonder if you could talk about the progression of revenue through the quarter. Did it improve on sandy and what was the cause for sort of the change in tone versus the execution?S.D. ShibulalIf you look at it when we actually entered the quarter, we had -- for the rest of the year to achieve our 5% guidance, we have to do two quarters of 3.7% growth, in Q3 as well as in Q4. And Q4 is definitely slightly more, it\u2019s a softer quarter for us. This means in Q3 we have to do even more than 3.7%. Now once we entered the quarter two phenomena happened. Number one, we had change in currency in sudden furloughs, which was not planned before. We also saw furloughs being extended beyond our original plan, which means that we will lose revenue as well as billing days because of furlough.Number two, the sandy impact. And many of our people were not in the office for a week or even at times two weeks. So both posed serious challenges. In the quarter ended we have to do 3.7% or more, and another quarter we have to do 3.7%. What happened -- so those challenges were articulated and so what happened was two three things. Number one, we of course have very strong relationships with our clients and we were able to work very closely with our clients to mitigate a lot of the additional gap which could have emerged because of unplanned furloughs or sandy. Both, well, we were able to mitigate most of those. Number one.Number two, when we started out the quarter, we have not factored in any pricing increase. If you look at this quarter, the pricing increase of 1.8% has shown up because of the portfolio shift. This is not something which can be predicted on a weekly basis. That actually comes towards the end because we're running about 10,000 programs and each one of them is behaving in a slightly different manner.Finacle and BPO grew substantially well this quarter. So the challenges we articulated were definitely there. They were based on extended as well as the number of furloughs being higher than what we had planned, and impact of the Sandy having losing billing days. Though we are fortunate enough to mitigate most of that through our relationships and ramp ups and then the pricing favored us by 1.8% growth because of the portfolio shift. And Rajiv wants to add to this -- little bit to it.Rajiv Bansal", "If you look at \u2013 we had this services growth of 3.7% last quarter. We had a volume increase of 3.8% last quarter and this quarter our volume has been about 1.5% and the services growth has been about 3.3%. So a lot of growth this quarter has come from Finacle, which is a product business, which is choppy, which depends on the license sale and the deal closures. BPO has grown about 14%. So what surprised was in terms of the business exchange and the price increase that we got about 1.8% during the quarter. And also when we actually spoke about the challenges, we also said that there are four months in the half year left for us to mitigate some of this stuff that we're seeing. We had spoken to all of you on 12 October and when we spoke to you again after some 40 days, the environment had turned bad. There were more challenges that we had seen at that point of time, but at that time also we were talking about having four more months in the half year left for us to be able to meet the guidance and that we're going to go all out and try to meet our numbers.Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery ScottOkay. Maybe you could just talk about pricing. I know you addressed it in your earlier call, but is this pricing increase sustainable? In other words, do you think that the mix shift could continue to favor you through the back half of the year? And is it fair to say that the pricing increase is not being driven by any kind of macro terms? In other words, demand is increasing or picking up so that it\u2019s driving the pricing.Rajiv BansalNo, I think you should not read too much into the pricing increase because this are quarterly phenomena depending on the business mix change, depending on the deal closures and ramp-ups, which happen across 10,000 programs that Shibu was mentioning. So I think business mix change over the period of time. If you see a business mix shift over multiple quarters, then it could signify a pricing change, but I think other than that on a quarterly basis you should not read too much into it. We expect pricing to be stable, and with the quarterly movement up and down depending on the business mix changes.Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery ScottOkay, just last question from me. We've had a string of quarters where things had been more difficult. Do you feel like you've got a proper business momentum underneath your feet after this quarter and how do you think about the margin profile? I know that you've kind of kept it at the level it is. Should we expect that to continue into the next year, into 2013, and what could be the changes there?Rajiv BansalThe business environment continues to be challenging. The clients are still not very confident about spending anything in the longer-term investments into the IT. I think a lot of it would depend on how the economic environment of the country is, how the consumer confidence index is and how much confidence it gives to the corporates in this money. So I think the environment remains challenging. The clients we have \u2013 though the RSP activities have picked up, the deal volumes have picked up, but the deal closure times are still very long and the decision making cycles are actually much longer and goes multiple levels for approval. So that continues and that is a reason it's very difficult to forecast and predict numbers on an accurate basis at a very short period of a quarter. ", "Coming on the margin, we have been able to maintain margins in this quarter in spite of the wage increase that we give at offshore. However, we are giving wage increases for our overseas folks and that is likely to impact our margins by about 1% next quarter. I expect the margins, Steve, in fact if I look at moving into the next year, our utilization is still at about 71%. We would ideally like it to be around 79% \u00a0to 80%, which means that we have about 9% utilization lever which gives me a lever to have margins of about 4% into the next year if volumes pickup.So I think we have levers on the margins, but I would expect margins to move in the narrow band of 100 to 200 basis points going into the next year. I think Shibu wants to add something to that.S.D. ShibulalAs Rajiv was saying, and I was saying that we have done well this quarter but the world has not changed. The world is exactly what it was, there is no [singular] change in the world. And I am sure you are aware, all are aware of this. The U.S. uncertainties continue. In fact in financial services alone, I was reading reports which said that there is an over-employment of 60,000 people. And we have seen layoffs in multiples organizations. If you look at Europe, the sovereign debt issues are continuing. So our clients\u2019 confidence has really not changed. Even though they have cash, their confidence has really not changed too much, which means that their ability to invest for long term programs, ability to take quick decisions, and their ability to even ramp up on decisions where they have taken -- cases where they have taken decisions, is still low.So we remain quite cautious at this point. Even if I look at next year, which you know -- if I look at next year, we expect the budget to be flat or marginally down. We expect it to be more than marginally down in certain segments, like FSI. And we also expect that even after the budget closes, there will be scrutiny of the budget while it is being spend on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So we have done well in Q3. We remain quite cautiously optimistic.Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.Moshe Katri - Cowen and CompanyJust to follow up on the margin question. So should we assume now that the mid-20% levels, kind of the new base for EBIT margins for Infosys compared to where we were maybe a couple of years ago, close to the 30% range. Thanks.Rajiv Bansal", "You know, as we said, we have acquired Loadstone, so the numbers that you see now include Loadstone also and Loadstone being European consulting company is going to be at lower single-digit margins. So once you see the consolidation impact, we too see an impact on margins for the group as a whole. Having said that, margin is a factor of growth because if you look at it, you know as any of the IT company would hire most of our requirement through campuses which require us to make demand projection almost about 18 months ahead of time.We go the campuses, if we go the campuses this year, we would typically have again fall on the demand in 2015 or the revenue growth in 2015. So it is a difficult thing to predict about the growth two years down the line in this kind of unstable and volatile environment. So in case we are able to predict well and we hire only to meet our demand, I think the margins will start improving because as the utilization starts going up, we would see that the margins are improving because the cost has already built up. The only cost which will come incrementally is the differential between the onset in offshore cost for the people who have to go onsite for their starting project.So at 71% utilization, I believe that we have enough levers for margins. But having said that, I would like to say that -- and we are in the middle of our execution of the new strategy as we talk about Infosys 3.0, it requires us to make a lot of investment in the business, a lot of investment in the product platform services in the consulting space in our frontline. And I would believe that till we reach a fairly [stable environment] in that journey, maybe the margins at the mid-20 is what should be good.Moshe Katri - Cowen and CompanyGreat. Understood. And just for clarification purposes, FSI was up 6% sequentially, is there a way to kind of take out Loadstone from that and see what the number was, assuming that Loadstone did contribute to growth in FSI? And then maybe we can go through the same exercise with Europe?S. D. ShibulalThe contribution from Lodestone was marginal for the quarter so you\u2026Moshe Katri - Cowen and CompanyOkay. How about Europe? If you're looking at sequential growth out of Europe, maybe we can take Lodestone out and also try to get what was the number actually organically?Rajiv Bansal", "Even if you take out Lodestone, Europe has done well for us during the quarter. Our revenues for Europe had actually gone up by about 1.5% as a percentage of total revenues. So Europe has seen good growth and actually we're seeing quite a few deals that we have signed up this quarter have been in Europe. So Europe continues to do well. There are a lot of opportunities in the European market. So even without Lodestone we are seeing good traction in Europe and the growth has been quite healthy in Europe this quarter.Moshe Katri - Cowen and CompanyOkay. Then out of 53 new client additions, how many came from Europe?B. G. Srinivas13 new clients added during the quarter, excluding Lodestone for Europe.Moshe Katri - Cowen and CompanyUnderstood. And you don't have the organic number for Europe, out of Lodestone yet?B. G. Srinivas", "We have. Sequentially we were 1.2% up for Europe, excluding Lodestone.Moshe Katri - Cowen and CompanyOkay. Thank you very muchOperatorThe next question is from Anantha Narayan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Anantha Narayan \u2013 Credit SuisseThank you and my best New Year wishes to the management team. Rajiv, just one follow-up question on the margin side. The guidance for next quarter that you've given basically implies that on an organic basis margins will probably decline by about 250 basis points for FY '13 as a whole, which seems to be a little bit higher than the earlier 200 basis points that you had guided to us, and the rupee has actually been significantly weaker than what you had estimated for the second half of this year. Can you just help us understand what has really changed?Rajiv BansalI couldn't hear you. Can you speak a little louder? I couldn't get the full question.Anantha Narayan \u2013 Credit SuisseSo, Rajiv, my question was that your guidance on margins for next quarter implies 250 basis point decline in organic margins for the year versus the earlier guidance of 200 basis points, while the INR has actually been a lot weaker than what you had initially assumed for the second half. So can you just help us understand the change now?Rajiv Bansal", "Now see when we spoke about the margin, we said the margins will move between 200 basis points to 300 basis points. When we gave a guidance in October, when we gave for $2.97, we had assumed a certain set of expenses, a certain set of revenue growth, the business mix change. So now it has moved from about 200 basis points as you\u2019re seeing to 250 basis points. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we have been able to maintain our margins this quarter. Next quarter is a soft quarter. We are instituting onsite wage increases and also we have taken about $13 million impact because on Lodestone. As I explained, because of amortization of intangibles and for deferred compensation, there is an impact of roughly about $8 million next quarter and that's a charge that we have to take for Lodestone. Also, Lodestone is coming at a much lower margin and once you consolidate it will have an impact on the overall margins for the Company.Anantha Narayan \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So this 250 basis point is the organic number that I was mentioning. Lodestone shouldn't impact that number, right?Rajiv BansalYeah, Lodestone\u2019s charge will come on the IL books because when Infosys bought Lodestone, a part of the compensation \u2013 a part of the purchase price is towards the deferred compensation which is being amortized over the next 36 months. So that the charge is coming from IL books and also the amortization of intangibles impact the IL books.Anantha Narayan \u2013 Credit SuisseOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.David Grossman - Stifel NicolausThank you. I'm wondering if I could just go back to the flow of revenue over the course of the quarter. It sounds like the big change vis-\u00e0-vis some of your messaging intra-quarter was an unanticipated realization benefit from a mix shift to CSI, given that your unit growth penciled out organically at about 1.5% sequential growth. So as you look at that and obviously some benefit from Finacle and BPO as well, but when you look back at that CSI activity, how much of that was tied to the contract activity signed in the fiscal second quarter? And just maybe you would help us understand, the types of contracts that we are talking about that drove that unexpected increase and what the fall through could like in the quarter?S.D. Shibulal", "So actually if you -- there are two factors to that commentary. One was unexpected negativity we saw because of the furloughs and super storm sandy. And that we were able to mitigate. Most of it we were able to mitigate. That we were able to mitigate working with our clients even in situations where clients announced unanticipated furloughs. We were able to work with our clients and definitely continue most of the critical programs. So that mitigated that -- and that we could only make out as time went by because we were discussing in the beginning of December. And it was still in progress.The second part is [portfolios] that we are talking about. If you remember last quarter when we discussed, we had discussed about transformational wins. Transformational wins generally show up within a quarter. Within a quarter it will start showing up at least definitely in the second quarter. So what happened was that we realized at the quarter went by and especially as after the middle of the quarter, we ramped up some of the transformational wins which we had in the previous quarter.And that portfolio shift happened during the quarter but it will show up towards the end of the quarter. So the ramp up which happened in consulting and systems integrations is predominantly due to the wins which we actually announced I think in the previous quarter.David Grossman - Stifel NicolausSo if we -- going back to that fall through in the fourth quarter and beyond, front end revenue on some large (inaudible) demand sooner than expected or you expect to continue in to the second quarter.S.D. ShibulalDavid, you were not clear. I couldn\u2019t make out, could you please repeat?David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Sure. So the question was really how this flow out over the next couple of quarters. It sounds like you have got some transformational business both last quarter, you saw some of that revenue ramp this quarter, next couple of quarters. Or is it something that was more front end related to some large business signed in the second quarter.S.D. ShibulalSee the reflection -- the interesting things is, there is always a lag in the revenue profile change versus the win rate, win profile change, right. So last quarter we had transformational wins. If you look at this quarter, we are talking about large deal when we said that we have won about $730 million of TCV and most of it in business in IT operations space. Those will flow through in the next two quarters, right. We expect them to flow through in the next two quarters unless something unforeseen happens. So when that happens, you will see a different portfolio shift. The [basic] programs that we talked about have ramped up and probably continue to be on that ramp rate or maybe marginally higher. (Inaudible) the large deals that which we have won, will also start showing up.So that is why the portfolio will shift quarter-on-quarter. They are reflecting wins from the past. So for example in this $700 million opportunities that are ramping up, that will definitely show up in the bid space.David Grossman - Stifel NicolausOkay. So would you expect the mix to shift back a little bit in the fourth quarter?S.D. ShibulalIn fourth quarter the mix -- based on the wins it could shift back marginally. These will operate in a narrow range and we are running 10,000 programs at any point in time. Right, 10,000 programs. And, so some of them could suddenly ramp up, and some of them may not ramp up as we think in the current quarter, especially in a volatile environment. When the volatility is not there, we know exactly how many people will get added this quarter, but because of client uncertainties and various other things today, there is volatility in that. So I would tend to believe that it will operate in the narrow band. But this quarter win, Q3 wins where, the ones which we talked about are predominantly in the bid space.David Grossman - Stifel NicolausOkay. And then let me just go back now to your margin equation, Shibu. My calculation is that, margins based on your guidance and tax rate guidance is about down 280 basis points versus your previous guidance I think was down 200 basis points and I think one of the previous questions mentioned that currency runs probably about a 50 to 60 basis point incremental tailwind versus your previous guidance. So clearly the margin guidance has come down and I understand the impact from Lodestone and the impact from utilization on your margins. So you put a wage increase in last quarter, you\u2019re putting one in this quarter. Help us understand how we should think about both the impact of wages in utilizations going forward because utilization at some point becomes somewhat of a discretionary item when you can increase or decrease it based on your \u2013 how much of a bench you want to keep in place. So can you maybe just quickly walk us through your thoughts going into next year in terms of how we should think about the wage increases given what you've done this year and the utilization rate?S. D. ShibulalSo let me address the wage increase first. We gave a wage increase of 6% offshore. We had delayed it for the year and we did it in October. We also are planning to do an onsite wage increase in U.S, 3% to 4% actually right now in Q4. We did 12,000 promotions about two quarters back. We are also going ahead with 6,000 to 9,000 promotions in Q4. That is that side and leads to another merger impact. 6% increase in offshore compensation is approximately about 1% impact on the margin, and about 4% increase on around \u2013 on (inaudible). U.S. compensation would be about 1%, another 1% possibly \u2013 yeah, 1% impact on our margins.So our operating margin has remained in a very narrow band. In fact it has come down by 0.2% without the impact of Lodestone and that 0.2% is because of the currency appreciation of 0.5%. Now if you look at the utilization, it is \u2013 I wouldn't call it discretionary actually. The utilization for us is very important for us to keep it to 70% to 80%. It's very important because it is even more important to our people that they have work to do. So it is 70% to 80%. Yes, when the prediction doesn\u2019t happen as we think, we will end up with excess bench. The impact of the utilization is the following. The additional 8% bench which we're carrying actually has a margin impact, direct impact of 1.5% because 8% of 17% which is our offshore compensation and the indirect impact of about 2.5% because of the revenue loss.If the revenue is there that will be give us better margins. So the impact of that 8% is approximately direct 1.5% and indirect about 2.5%, about 4% on our margins. So in the coming year \u2013 so the solution to all this is growth. If growth happens the utilization will pick up. If the utilization pick up, the direct cost \u2013 direct impact will definitely come down and the indirect impact which I talked about will accrue on the positive side. So if the utilization goes up to about 78% to 79%, we expect to gain benefit of that in the margin based on, there are many other levers that's why I'm not giving you the number ,but based on the 1.5%, plus 2.5% I talked about.Rajiv BansalJust to add to that from a margin front, when we said about 200 basis points to 250 basis points, just to be more clear, there is a 0.2% impact because of rupee and 0.3% impact because of the Lodestone charge, which comes into the IL books, because this is about \u2013 when we acquired Lodestone, a part of the total purchase price is tied to the compensation, deferred compensation, which is paid only if the management stays with us till the end of third year. That under IFRS is a charge on the P&L of IL, which is on a monthly basis. This will roughly work to be about $8 million a quarter. So, for the half year the charge is about $13 million because this is effective November. So, a charge of $13 million on a half year revenue is roughly about 0.3% to 0.4% impact on the margin. Rupee appreciated by 0.5% during the quarter. If you take it for the half year, the impact is roughly about 0.2%. And that would explain the reason why the margins would move between 200 basis points to 250 basis points.Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Jesse Hulsing from Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest SecuritiesI wanted to follow-up on dynamics related to mix shift versus rates. So from a broader perspective in these larger deals that you're pursuing, what is the broader industry trend in your view of where rates are going in the ADM side of your business? Are they pretty stable? Are you seeing them trend down or trend up? And as a follow-up to that, do you think that the mix will shift significantly to ADM because of the consulting lead-in work that you saw in Q4?S. D. ShibulalOkay. So, we have assumed pricing as stable for the rest of the year and there are pockets for our business which is definitely price sensitive. I would think that the application and maintenance space is price sensitive. I would think that there are certain other areas which are price sensitive. In those areas we are doing things like managed service, we are doing ticket based pricing and various other models to address those challenges. But there are areas which are price-sensitive. That is why it is even more important for us to manage the portfolio and have growth in areas where the sensitivity is lower. So, if you look at the consulting and system integration space, we operate under the pricing umbrella of the Global SIs, and that allows us to actually maintain pricing premium.So, the whole approach, if you look at the Infosys 3.0 strategy, is actually to address this problem in the long-term. That means it's about creating a balanced portfolio, one which is a consulting and system integration, which is higher revenue productivity. Products and platform, which is non-linear in nature due to effort. And grow bids where some part of the business is price-sensitive. That's the whole approach and that is how we are trying to manage the portfolio.Now, I don't see these, what we call ADM work, and I will never say never, but for most part will not flow from the consulting work into ADM. What we call consulting is quite comparable to what Global SIs call consulting work. It includes consulting, system integration and the packages, like I said, being Oracle, led transformational work and some of the follow-up work which we do. What we call ADM work is pure application development and maintenance which will be Greenfield development of an application within Java or.NET or anyone of those. The chance is that coming out of the consulting which we do is there, but it is very minimal.Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest SecuritiesThanks. And the large deals which you closed (in the quarter)?S. D. Shibulal", "The large deals which we closed, many of them this quarter or most of them this quarter, are in BIT space, which is an IT operating space. And many of them are (multi-level), some of them are infra led deals.Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest SecuritiesFor those deals, were the wins primarily self-sourced or did you win those in a bake off, RFP type process?S. D. Shibulal", "Many of them are in RFP like process. Some of them are vendor consolidations where we have won our portion and additional work from the client. And I would say maybe one of them are sole sourced. But many of them are RFP led and some of them are vendor consolidation.Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. Thanks. And to follow-up on previous questions about Sandy. Were you able to quantify Sandy's impact on the quarter? You've mentioned that you it was difficult inter-quarter. Looking back, have you been able to put a number on how many hours clipped out due to Sandy?", "Rajiv Bansal", "As Shibu was referring earlier, we were able to mitigate most of it and the impact of Sandy has been very negligible on us.", "Jesse Hulsing \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. ", "David Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hey guys. Just following up I guess on the last question a little bit too on the core ADM work. I know that's kind of your most I guess stable recurring business and I think your biggest offering too. That did go into negative mode this quarter. I think it declined 3% year-over-year, first decline in about four or five years. I guess what's the confidence that that picks up again? And maybe you can just go through why it did decline this quarter.", "S. D. Shibulal", "I wouldn't read it as a secular trend. First of all many of the deal wins which we had this quarter are in the bid space. Now this whole thing about ADM, focusing on ADM, going forward may not be the right approach because we will look at bids as a portfolio and the boundaries are soft. That's the whole purpose of looking into the portfolio. If you keep such hard boundaries for people or for revenue, the benefit of that service line or the offering, do not reach the clients. So it's actually a porous, slightly porous boundary line. From a bit perspective, which is actually a combination of application development and maintenance infrastructure, independent validation. BPO, I think that will be a core offering from our side and it will continue to grow. It is a must for it to grow because that is our largest offering, 60% of our business comes from there. So it has to grow.", "David Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. And then I guess one other thing, just the other income line that was $92 million this quarter, how much of that is core interest income? Just so we know how to model that going forward because I know there is a lot of moving parts in that line. Just wanted to know what the core part of that $92 million is?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. Almost all of it is interest income. We did not have any impact of Forex into this kind of non-operating income.", "David Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "Yes guys. So you received a major boost from the rupee (inaudible) mid-2011, when the rupee really began to depreciate, yet margins have dropped and they still seem to be dropping heading into the March quarter. So I guess the question is, where has your expense structure changed since mid-2011 or if the expense structure is not materially changed, then is there something that's happened on pricing on like-for-like deals even though your overall reported pricing has held up?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Well, there are two factors which have contributed to the drop in margins if you normalize for the rupee depreciation which has taken place. One is definitely pricing our year-on-year margin \u2013 our pricing has actually dropped by about 3.5%, which is quite significant and which flows into the bottom line. And second is also with respect to utilization. If you\u2019re comparing with 2011, 2012, our utilization used to be in the high 70s and roughly about 79% to 80% if I remember right and today we're operating at about 71% utilization. So these two, the pricing is impacted about 3.5%, you had utilization drop of about 9% and these two very determinedly are slowing the operating margins. If you look at it, we have been able to mitigate some impact of it because of the drop in operating margin is roughly about 2.5%, though if you look at the pricing about 3.5%, utilization drop by 8%, it would have been much more. ", "We have actually been running it very efficiently during the year. As Shibu said, we had delayed compensation increases because we saw the utilization \u2013 very low the pricing drops are happening. So we have done a lot in terms of trying to keep our margins good and we expect that as the growth starts picking up, we would see the utilization start going up to 80%, which is where we would like it to be and pricing I believe would remain stable. We have lost about 3.5% on pricing during the year, but going forward I expect pricing to be stable. There could be quarterly movements depending on the business mix change, but I don't really see a secular trend in the pricing drops anymore.Rod Bourgeois \u2013 Bernstein", "So, on the pricing question, that's very helpful to know that pricing on a like-for-like basis has dropped in such a way that it's contributed to the underlying margin degradation. But I guess the question that raises is, what's changing in the market or in your strategy that would cause pricing to go stable after the decline that it's experienced in a pretty meaningful way over the last year?S. D. Shibulal", "So, actually more importantly the question is, what is changing in our strategy to keep our revenue realization stable. Because the pricing is definitely dependent on the market, at least for certain set of services which we offer. So, the important issue is to make sure that the revenue realization is stable or hopefully marginally going up over a period of time. So for that the important issues are the following. Number one, to have revenue growth in higher revenue productivity areas like consulting and system integration. Number two, have revenue growth in production and platform space where I expect that in medium term the effort dependency is 50%, 50% of what the other areas are. And in the areas where it is price sensitive, we move to more of a managed services model. So, if you look at the wins in this quarter then many of them are managed services wins, where the client is looking at outcomes rather than input, the effort. So by doing that, if you can increase productivity, if you can drive efficiency, if we can do it better than what we have promised the clients, some of it accrued to us. So, the strategy is about making sure that the revenue realization is stable or we can improve on it over a period of time.Rod Bourgeois \u2013 BernsteinAll right. And if I can just ask on (inaudible). So the plan, it appears to stabilize pricing as to shift your mix towards higher end segments and then also on the unit services in the commodity segment. But barring a mix shift, which generally requires pretty strong revenue growth to make a meaningful mix shift. Barring a mix shift, what do you think happens to pricing on like-for-like deals, are we still in a position where like-for-like pricing is in (decline)?Rajiv BansalSee, we run pricing in a portfolio. It also depends on the opportunities that we see. Whether we're incumbent, whether the opportunity is (inaudible) into a client where the competition is very strong, we want to make a strategic entry. It's a client that we've been trying to pursue for the last couple of years. It's a different geography. So, pricing side has a mix of lot of factors. And it's not about, no two deals are alike. So, pricing strategy also depends on what the competition is and what is the kind of opportunities for you to improve your margins as you go along. So, this is not a very simple thing to say about that on a like-to-like basis how the margins are changing on deal to deal. But as we said, we expect that keeping our pricing strategy and portfolio mix, we would expect the pricing to be stable as we go into the next year.OperatorThe next question is from Mayank Tandon from Needham. Please go ahead.Mayank Tandon - Needham & CompanyI just had a question on some of the key trends looking into 2013. Could you provide some perspective on the resiliency of the European growth? I mean do you think we can see the trends continue over the course of 2013 based on client activity? Also in terms of the regulatory side, do you think that both healthcare and financial services could be important catalysts over the course of the year? And last but not least, would you consider maybe buying come captives to scale up your operations, particularly on the BPO side?B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G. With respect to Europe, while there is definitely the macro overhang and the challenges and the uncertainties will continue into this calendar year, it's very difficult to predict on a medium-term to long-term basis how the scenario will pan out. However, currently what we are seeing is, there is less of panic, there is relatively stable environment within our clients. The clients are in the process of finalizing their budgets. The early indicators \u2013 though the budgeting process is not complete, the early indicators are flat to negative and that is the data points we have today. So we presume if the environment continues to be stable and that the deal making cycle continue as business as usual, then there is possibility of an upswing in the revenues for the year. But this is something we need to watch on a quarterly basis. It's difficult to predict in the medium-term and this is something we are watching closely. We continue to make investments into Europe in terms of accessing markets, both in Continent and in U.K. In terms of other markets, we are seeing new initiatives in client activity, both in Financial Services and Manufacturing in the Nordics. That's an area which we will look into as we go into our fiscal year starting March.", "Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Company", "Also any comments on the regulatory side and also in terms of captive strategy?", "B. G. Srinivas ", "Okay. The regulatory side, obviously from a Financial Services and Telco, they have the industries which will continue to invest into introducing new controls and the back systems which it supports. This is an area where we are also focusing on. However, it's again difficult to predict the discretionary spend which will go into this, but we are already working with our clients in some of these initiatives and we are also bringing in expertise to help clients actually deploy these new control measures with less overall cost of implementation, also leveraging technology. But again, like I said, while these are areas of focus, we will definitely see a revenue stream occurring because of investments in these areas. We are also looking at some of the initiatives within our clients on risk management and that's an area of focus as well. Even then overall environment in Financial Services and Telcos are under significant cost pressures. The initiatives are also on cost pickup measures. That\u2019s something and again an area that we are looking into.", "Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Company", "Finally, just wanted to get a sense of strategy around captives. It seems like there are opportunities to buy captives to scale up the BPO side. I wanted to see if that would be one of the priorities looking into 2013 for Infosys?", "Swami Swaminathan", "Hi, it\u2019s Swami here. Yes, from a BPO growth standpoint, the growth engines are really both \u2013 all three lines, which is really organic, inorganic and as well as captives. If you remember, recall 2007 we had picked up the Philips captives and that journey is pretty much on. So the road that we are seeing in obviously coming across on all three streams of activity and initiative that we regularly launch. So, very clearly, in this year, we obviously have also started to look at emerging economies pretty closely. We have launched four geo business units. You have an India business unit and LATAM business unit. You have the Eastern Europe business unit and an Asia Pacific business unit which really focuses on selling solutions and propositions to corporations and to governments in these emerging economies. So, as a part of that obviously we continue to scan the environment on captive opportunities which we believe is a value that we can pretty much add and leverage.", "Mayank Tandon \u2013 Needham & Company", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for spending time with us.

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Linda. Hello to everyone and welcome to Infosys Q4 '13 earnings call and from me from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal; along with other members of the senior management. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2014. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue improved for in [ph]  U.S. dollar terms, grew sequentially by 1.4%, including the Lodestone acquisition. Excluding that acquisition, our revenue grew by 0.8%. EPS for the quarter was $0.78 as against $0.76 last quarter. Our EPS guidance for the year was $2.97. And irrespective of the lower growth, we have delivered $2.97 plus $0.05, actually $3.02 for the year. Pricing has dropped by 0.7% in Q4. In fact, the pricing war [indiscernible] in Q4 and in Q3, so the lower part of the year [ph] , they had growth of 1.8%. There continues to be quarterly movement due to changes in the business mix, as well as the volatile environment.", "Lodestone integration continues to be on track in all dimensions, like go-to-market, delivery capability, systems and process, finance and HR and all other areas. At the same time, Lodestone, being a consulting organization, comes with a single-digit margin and it takes time for the offshore part to get built up. Over the last one quarter, we had 5 joint wins in the market. So the joint go-to-market proposition is established well in all verticals.", "We are tracking slightly behind plans on revenues and cost targets, as the focus is on above-mentioned areas, which took priority over pure revenue and cost targets. And certainly, this is continuing in the broader economic environment. We are living in a very fragile environment. The global environment has completely -- hasn't completely recovered from the downturn, as well as the Eurozone crisis. Though the clients have finalized their budgets, we have to see if it improves the decision-making cycle, including discretionary spend. Our dependence on the discretionary spend is approximately 33%, which is quite different from the industry average.", "Today, technology is at the center of many of the key business decisions being made, whether it is cost rationalization, productivity improvement, process improvement or future expansion plans. We believe that our suite of services and suite of service capabilities across operations, transformation and innovation, will allow us to compete and perform in the long term. We are confident of navigating the short-term challenges due to uncertainty in the environment.", "I will now touch upon a few specific points relating to each of our business units. In financial services, our clients expect their business prospects to be overall flat to down in the coming year. In financial sectors, the appetite for spending money was much higher 12 months ago compared to cost-conscious environment today. We expect opportunities in the new technologies like Big Data, mobility, analytics, social technologies and legacy platform modernization in financial services.", "We have seen traction in the communication [ph]  space, products and platforms in capital markets, while the broad management in cards and payments, next generation portals and payment hubs in banking, business challenge [ph]  like mobility, social media and portals, including aiding [ph]  in customer experience, and insurance. We are focusing on capitalizing further opportunities.", "In Retail and CPG, it ran [ph]  the business but we're still under pressure. Our overall technology has been increasing in SAP, digital business intelligence and new efficiency platforms. We partner with our clients on their digital strategy in most of our retail clients.", "Turning to manufacturing. The budgets are exposed -- expected to be flat to down in most of the subsegments like auto, aerospace and resources. Clients are investing in reducing complexity, lowering costs, increasing the spend on new product rollout and service transformation.", "We have -- we see exciting opportunities in the areas like digital transformation and analytics. Cloud adoption is increasing in sales and HR. Our strategy is in good hands [ph] , focused on transformation and capability building, leveraging our capabilities in operating [ph]  systems and helping our clients build new products. We expect manufacturing vertical to have a slower H1 and then see a pick-up in H2, as large equipment inventories get depleted in the next few months and production levels gradually pick up after that.", "In energy, utilities and communication services space, spending is expected to be down in most of the subverticals, barring oil sector, retail energy and mid-market utilities. Telecoms, it will continue to see its top line shrink. And gas companies are creating revenue per share due to supply of [ph]  gas. And larger utilities are seeing revenue decline due to unfavorable rate case outcomes. However, we see different drivers of spend in different segments and quarterly spending to improve customer experience and introducing new product lines, leveraging LTE. Energy companies are seeing regulatory [ph]  per share on EHS and compliance, which is creating opportunities for raising production optimization and detailed knowledge management. Utilities are investing in Smart Grid and phasing, focusing on driving cost efficiencies.", "On the discretionary spend, we expect it to be higher in FY '13 over FY '12 in RETL and in manufacturing. And as you know, our discretionary spend share is about 32% of our revenue. In RETL, we see the brand for services around residual [ph]  commerce and set to enable [ph]  transformation. And then we will take along with strong demand for omnichannel commerce, built around digital marketing and centralization. In manufacturing, we see the inflows of rate in discretionary areas being higher than the year -- higher than a year back. However, in ECS, decision delays are becoming more common and deals are becoming smaller with positive ROA requirements.", "In products and platforms and solutions area in Q4, we have added -- we had 12 wins and added another 7 clients, taking the client count to 79. Our total  [indiscernible] book, as of right now, is $685 million, which is an increase $85 million during the quarter. Our journey in this area received strong validation this quarter. Infosys Cloud Ecosystem Hub won the 2012 Golden Peacock Award for the most innovative product/service. Our Edge suite of business platforms won NASSCOM Business Innovation Award for 2013. Forrester Research has positioned Infosys as the leader in its Enterprise Mobility Services report. Ovum, the global analyst firm, recognized Flypp digital experience platform as a well-developed ecosystem of services, large repository of apps and the monetization process.", "The road ahead is challenging. Environment has changed significantly recently. The signals are mixed, where significant macroeconomic factors affecting our major economies -- affecting all the major economies, which may have impact on growth and pricing. The biggest challenge for us is to get growth back. And for that, we need to make investment in business.", "Due to the volatility and dynamic nature of the environment, it is difficult to predict margins in the short term. Therefore, we have only given a revenue guidance, 6% to 10%. And the 6% revenue guidance implies a quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.5%, and the 10% revenue guidance implies a 2% quarter-on-quarter growth. Given all the factors, as usual, our guidance is a statement of fact. Due to the volatility over the last few quarters, we have taken a wide band on our guidance rather than a narrow band, which is between 6% to 10%. Given all the information at this point in time, we believe that this guidance can be achieved and I'm certainly confident of achieving this guidance.", "With that, now let me request Rajiv to talk and then we can open up for Q&A.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Good morning, everyone. Our revenue for the quarter grew by 1.4%, revenue in rupee terms, INR 10,454 crore, growth of 0.3% in rupee terms because we had a rupee appreciation of 1.1% for the quarter. Our EPS for the quarter was INR 41.89 as against INR 41.47. And for the year, we have closed at INR 154.87 as against INR 145.55. The operating margin for the quarter is at 23.5%, including Lodestone. And excluding Lodestone, it is about 24.8%. We have maintained our -- we have been able to meet our EPS guidance in spite of a shortfall in revenues. Our volumes grew by 1.8% sequentially and 8.8% annually. Our pricing has fallen by about 0.7% in the quarter, primarily because of lower billing days as compared to the previous quarter. On an annual basis, pricing is down by about 3%. Our utilization is still low, which gives us advantage [ph]  for the future. It's still at about 68.5% including trainees and at 71.4% excluding trainees.", "Historically, the fourth quarter has been a soft quarter for us, and the start of the budget cycle for the clients and their delays in budget revision decision-making. The clients continue to weigh the uncertain environment, taking longer than expected to finalize their spending.", "Starting the quarter, we did speak about the gaps in our guidance and that we having about 96%, 97% visibility and that the balance to the 3% had to engage through ramp-ups in the deals that we have won in the previous quarters and also about the new deal wins that we are expecting in the current quarter. Some of that has actually quite delayed. Some of the ramp-ups didn't happen as of plan. Some of the deal decision-making got delayed to the subsequent quarter, impacting our meeting the numbers.", "We also had a cost currency impact of roughly about $8 million during the quarter because of the volatility in pounds and euro as against the dollar. We also had -- because of the Lodestone integration with Infosys and they're adopting the Infosys revenue numbers and accounting principles, there has been some reversal of revenue in Lodestone, which has also impacted our revenue numbers for the quarter. Having said that, as we go into the next year, I think we feel more confident than what we were at the beginning of last financial year. We have set out a guidance of 6% to 10%, which, as Shibu said, is about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter sequentially for the next 4 quarters, lower end, and 2% quarter-on-quarter for the next 4 quarters at the upper end. Considering that all the volatility in the environment, considering the uncertainty and the investment that we need to make -- to come [ph]  as part of our [ph]  strategy of Infosys point of view in the long run, we have decided against [ph]  giving the EPS guidance going forward.", "With that, I open it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ankur Rudra of Ambit Capital.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Could you first comment on the demand environment in spending you saw over the course of this quarter, and what you expect in FY '14? On the quarter, if you could comment on the linearity of the quarter [indiscernible] compared to the fourth quarter guidance [indiscernible] March-led or [indiscernible] over the course of the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I did not hear the full question. I will answer the first part and then you can repeat the second piece. On the first part, if you look at H1, that's a good indication, I think, we have one of the largest wins in H1. We won about $960 million of large end customers transformation [ph]  wins in H1. It is probably one of the highest for us. Our own pipeline is robust. So if you look at the result of that win and the [indiscernible] that's where they've grown by 3.7% excluding Lodestone. But the offshore has not picked up. The offshore has only picked up by 0.5%. That is why the --  [indiscernible] that is because of the delays in ramp-ups, which we are seeing. And the on-site also means that we will start actually ramping up on those deals, but the offshore has to get picked up for these 2 important things [ph] to come together. Our pipeline is robust and our win rates are marginally improved. Pricing for business [ph]  and IT operations space is under pressure. Continuing this integration for the most part will hold the pricing. So it is important for us to balance, to clear growth in both areas, both areas. So if you will repeat the second question, I could answer that.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Volumes [ph]  for that. The second part of the question was, what will be linearity of the fourth quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Linearity of the fourth quarter.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Was the disappointment led by something that happened in March? Or was it delayed [ph] over the course of the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. Actually, if you remember, in the beginning of Q3, we had said that we have gaps in H1, H2 revenues. And in Q3, the volume and the revenue [indiscernible] end up, which created [indiscernible] which came together to create the 4.2% growth which we had. In the beginning of Q3, we had said that for rest of the year, we have certain gaps which we need to address, and we have been addressing them gradually. And so as usual, when we enter the quarter, we have about 96% visibility, which means that we have to make up about 4% of the revenue, which is substantial. And we did make a part of it, but it did not get managed [ph]  completely. And when the revenue perhaps [ph]  will be dropped, whatever volume growth we've got also was negated a bit.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Last question on margins, if I can. Can you elaborate on the main sources of margin volatility that is preventing you from guiding for FY '14?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So there are multiple. I will go through one by one. We are entering the year with a margin headwind. That is the most important thing to remember. During the year, we have given a compensation increase on-site and offshore. While we have grown only by 4.5%, we have given a compensation increase of 6% offshore and 3% to 4% on-site. Because it was during the year [ph]  -- in fact, the on-site compensation increase went in only in Feb. That means for the year, we only accounted for 2 months of on-site compensation increase, that the remaining 10 months will come in, in the coming year. So we did a total of $140 million of headwinds, which we need to take. Lodestone has a charge, and that is because of the $350 million which we paid out. Only $200 million was paid out in the beginning. The remaining is supposed to be paid out on a period of time based on certain criteria. And we are accruing that charge on the P&L. So that is a $40 [ph]  million charge which we need to take. Lodestone is a completely on-site consulting corporation, which means that it will come in at single-digit margin. And the margin will get neutralized -- and the margin will get normalized when the offshore gets built. And during the quarter, there are good signs. We have won 5 deals jointly, which means that the offshore part of Lodestone will gradually get built, but bear [ph]  in time. It will take time -- over a period of time, which will create a charge of approximately $15 million, $16 million and -- sorry, about $10 million to $15 million. Then there is an issue on our on-site starting capacity because, as I'm sure you know, these applications have gone in and we are unsure about the percentage of conversion which will happen in these [ph]  applications. That means that if you have some of these [ph]  applications, what number of applications that will get approved because of oversubscription, nothing else -- because of oversubscription. So if that happens, we will be short-term capacity on-site, which means that we have to increase our subcontracting. And this is a trend which we have seen in the recent past, because our subcontracting costs have gone up by 2% over the last few quarters. So there are multiple headwinds which we have fared [ph]  during [ph]  the end of the year. Growth is the only solution. Growth is really the only solution. It's all about creating growth. If we can grow better than our guidance, then that will really give us positive -- that will definitely impact positively on our margins.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Just finally, sir, do you see any margin headwinds from the nature of the deals won in the last 6, 9 months? Maybe we can [indiscernible]", "S. D. Shibulal", "The pricing in business and IT operations is basically still [ph]  under pressure especially in application maintenance and infrastructure. We are doing very well in BPO. BPO margins are holding up. But in application maintenance and infrastructure, the pricing is under pressure. The competency [ph]  [indiscernible] definitely higher than in the past. And at the same time, our win rates have gone up. In digital accounts, we have to take a total [ph]  approach as far as the pricing is concerned, and then maybe we could be aggressive [ph]  at times. So all of these means that there is pricing pressure on a large part of our business, which is the business and IT operations. That is why it is important for us to pursue this strategy of absolute  [ph] -- over a period of time, building a business that is more holistic. We're growing our business and IT operation space, simultaneously growing our consulting and system integration space and building the products and platform business. We believe that, that's the way we will achieve our aspirations in the long run.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Diviya Nagarajan of UBS.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions on the margin headwinds that you've seen. You did explain what you saw this quarter, but you also said that you could see this on the -- in the shorter term as well. I'm trying to understand, if you assume that you deliver somewhere in your guidance range, this also implies that you will be looking at very similar growth rates as what you've done -- as to what you've done in fiscal '13. Would we then assume that the margin drop could be as severe as it has been in fiscal '13? Or is that the [indiscernible]?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes. So I will answer firstly and then give it to Rajiv. There are -- we're already entering the year with certain headwinds which we need to be aware of, which is -- there is a little impact on the compensation, which we gave last year, which is quite substantial, about $140 million. The Lodestone charges, the P&L charges really do not cost. It is more of a charge that comes down to the books. That is about $36 million plus about another $40 million or $50 million of margin impact because of the single-digit margin of the Lodestone entity as a whole, which will get negated over a period of time. And the possibility of increasing some contracts, of course [ph] , because of -- with the utilization, with the shortage. These factors are only for the coming year. These are not -- they will have little impact as we see it right now. That is why the margins are not under pressure. And the growth is the only solution because we have done all these lines [ph] . There is a headwind on the growth because while our volumes went up last year by 8.8%, which is very much in line with the overall guidance which we gave, our revenue only went up by 4.5%, which means that we also lost 3% on the revenue productivity. So if you look at the situation here, you'll learn that [ph]  revenue productivity is coming down and your cost is going up on employees, as well as in other factors. There will be pressure on margins. Our solution to the problem is only growth, and that is exactly what we are focused on. And it is we are focused on all-around growth. That also means that we cannot compromise on investments, which means investments for the clients, investments on our employees, investments into new things which we need to do. So we are, at this stage, better off doing those investments, addressing the concerns, trying to create, drive -- trying to create and drive growth rather than constraining growth. So we are taking a very conscious decision to make those investments and take the short-term challenges in margin so that, long term, we'll be better off. Rajiv?", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Is there any bottom kind of a number that you're willing to commit where you think that this is where I want the margins to kind of -- where I cut off investments and say, \"I cannot take a margin dilution beyond this point.\" Is there something that you have in mind?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So a fair way to answer is it is that we are not seeing that [ph]  aspiration. This is a company which has delivered superior margins for years and years and years. We are going through some structural change as well as a volatile environment. We have a lower utilization. We are adding the people. We have decided to carry the people. We have people joining us because we don't want to go back on the commitments. So it is a challenging environment, and we have taken a conscious decision to compromise our margins, or look at our margins in the long term rather than in the short term. On the long term, I would ask that we need to have industry standard margin or higher than that. But in the short term, we will see margin pressure.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got that. And I appreciate your concern that the world continues to be extremely uncertain and the services mix that we have continues to drag growth down for us as a company. Assuming that this uncertainty persists -- we've already seen almost 2 years plus of sub-industry level growth. This year, you are guiding again for growth, which is, at least currently, below the NASSCOM guidance. Are you looking at any changes that you think you can make, which will address this issue and come back to better growth rates?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, I think what needs to be -- when you compare, we need to compare apple versus apple, not apple versus orange. If you look at the NASSCOM average, the consulting and system integration work is 17% to 18%, whereas ours is 32% to 33%, so literally almost double that number, which means the volatility -- which means it will be more than what the average of NASSCOM will face. So it's important to look at this in those ways. See, the most important thing is to do what is right for the client. And you cannot make choices with the client, where we will say we will only do what will -- it is convenient for us, that where it is higher margins, where it's at higher revenue productivity for us. We have to -- our goal is to build those strategic relationships to a level which will sustain this corporation in the long run, which means that we have to do all of it and we have to grow in all of them. There is no compromising growth in one or the other. If you look at the $960 million in which we have over the last 2 quarters, I'm 100% sure that $700 million of that came from large business and IT operation space. Yes, the revenues are not thrown [ph]  in, whereas the on-site revenues have -- the on-site volume has gone up. So we are trying to create growth in all offerings, all in sync [ph] . And what is important for the client is what we need to do, too. And our focus will continue to do what is important for the client, and which we believe is to fire on all the 3 engines [ph] .", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sorry, and just one question -- one quick one before I come off of the hook [ph] . Any wage hikes, incrementally, planned for this year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "As we said, we have done wage hikes during the year on-site, as well as offshore. We are also looking at some -- going into the area [ph] , we are looking at structural changes to look at the balance between the fixed compensation and the variable compensation. And just like what we have done in the last year, we will -- during the year, we will look at compensation, starting now.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rahul Bhangare of William Blair.", "Rahul Bhangare", "I may have missed this in your earlier comments, but what is the organic growth guidance for fiscal '14?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, our guidance is between 6% to 10%, which includes everything. The Lodestone has been now completely integrated, and that is included in our guidance. So going forward, I think we would like to give one, single guidance. It will be 6% to 10%.", "Rahul Bhangare", "Okay. And then a few comments, you mentioned certain Lodestone revenue reversals. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what those reversals entailed?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, these are not reversals. This is -- they're calling [indiscernible] company [indiscernible] guidelines. And when we follow the guidelines on the -- when we acquired Lodestone and on the revenues, there would always be some adjustment which need to be made. And they were not -- it's a onetime thing which happened. So there is nothing more than that. There were no reversals as such.", "Rahul Bhangare", "Okay. And can you share your hiring plans for this year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, they're already freshers [ph] , which we had  committed to hire last year and the postponed offers of last year, which are joining us this year. That is roughly about 10,000-odd people, which will be joining us this financial year from the campuses of last year and the previous year. As -- in addition to that, we would look at how our growth trajectory is because our utilization is still quite low. And depending on the need, we will adjust our hiring during the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I just wanted to talk a little more about the margin picture. If we go back 3 months ago, the commentary on margin, which was an important topic back then, the commentary that I think you guys conveyed is that you would keep margins in a narrow band. During the quarter, this was a question that you received, I think, from a number of investors. And those investors, I think, were feeling that your commentary implied you'd keep margins relatively flattish in fiscal '14. So the question is, what's changed today versus during the quarter on your outlook with margins? Is it an increased posture for price aggression, or is there something else underlying the change in your outlook on the margin front? Because the factors that you cited, thus far right, the compensation, the Lodestone and the visa challenges are factors that were known 3 months ago. So I'm looking for what factor has changed in the last month or 3 months.", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, when we spoke about our margin being in a narrow band of 100 basis points, we also said that if we get the growth of -- at decent levels as above industry levels, we would be able to maintain margins at plus/minus 100 basis points. So that was with the caveat of seeing good growth during the next financial year. Based on the guidance that we've given at 6% to 10%, I think we realize that the volatility, quarter-on-quarter volatility is pretty high if you look at this quarter. We were pretty confident in January when we gave our guidance. So we had gaps about -- in terms of our guidance for Q4. But based on the deal wins that we had in the previous quarter and the deals which are in the pipeline that's supposed to be closed in the quarter, I think we had reasonable assurance about meeting the number. But the fact that volatility is very high, the deal ramp-ups are not happening as planned. The deal closures have not happened as per the schedule. And this creates a confusion, this creates a challenge in terms of our [indiscernible] margin on a quarterly basis. As we go along in the next year, we have to solve this growth issue because we have to get the growth. And for getting the growth, that's a short-term challenge, where we have to make some investments in terms of visas, in terms of hiring people on-site and the right set [ph]  of people. We do have a low utilization, but our utilization is -- the bench is primarily freshers [ph] , who have hired -- who have been hired in the last 12, 24 months. They're not skilled resources. They're not senior resources, who can report on projects on day 1. We realize that if the growth comes back to about industry average, then we have the ability to get these people billed on the project, which will be a huge margin given to us. Second, we also realize that because of the kind of pattern we are seeing in client spending, the discretionary spending will not be coming back the way we had expected it, after seeing last quarter and these ramp-ups. Our pricing power typically comes from the discretionary spend that we see in the client spending. It's -- the commoditized business is under severe margin pressure. It's a lot of pricing pressure on the commoditized business. So we are not sure about -- if the growth doesn't come back to the extent that we would love it to come back, and the discretionary spend is not to the extent that we would want it to come back, the pricing will continue to be under pressure. With all this volatile factor, with all this negative and positives that we see, it is very difficult to predict a certain margin. We also realize that we have to make our investments in the, in sort of 3-point [ph]  of view of strategy. We are running this game of giving you guidance on a quarterly basis and annual basis and on top line, bottom line. And if you see challenges in top line, we start cutting cost to meet the bottom line. And we actually pulled back our investments in our long-term strategy. And I think time has come that we take up -- we begin to go ahead and invest in long-term strategies, irrespective of how the quarterly movements are happening. I think with all these factors and the investment that we need to make, I think it is much better that we focus on the growth, focus on all the investments, focus on long term instead of focusing on the margin for the current quarter and the current year.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "As of right now, what is the impact of pricing on like-for-like deals on the year-over-year change in your operating margin?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, the revenue productivity have come down by 3% year-on-year. Last quarter, the first quarter, it came down by some 4% plus, and then it went up and then it come down again. We had a 3% revenue productivity, which is productivity that will impact our margin directly. [indiscernible] 0.7%, so it was about 2.1% on the margin.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And then do you expect that pressure to get better or worse over the next year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think during the next year, the best hope we can have is to be stable. I would expect it to be slightly worse in the short term. Because we are entering the year with the headwinds of that drop, right? And then all the drops may not have gotten factored in so far. So the 3% drop that you've seen for the year, to get the rewards, we need to get the term [ph]  and the productivity in our discretionary spend, which might take a bit of time. And our base business is growing, which is where the pricing pressure is. And some of the things that's evolving, when you asked the question actually -- for example, the recent [indiscernible] when we look at the recent situation, for example, the current oversubscription. We are not confident anymore that we will get 100% of our applied visas, which means that we will have a shortage of about 40% based on our applied visa.", "Operator", "Our next question is from an Anantha Narayan of Credit Suisse.", "Anantha Narayan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "In terms of your acquisition numbers, it seems to have spiked up again this quarter. And that doesn't seem to be the clear messaging as far as wage increases for next year is concerned. So is there a risk of employee morale getting impacted?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually, our employee investment is actually fairly good in my mind this year right now, because during the year, we have done a number of things. Compensation's only one part of this whole exploration. We have done positive rationalization, getting rid of some of the archaic policies, communicating very clearly with our employees, keeping the communication channels open. All of those things we have done, and our employment upgrade [ph]  have gone up now. Attrition, while we are looking at this on the LTM basis, there have been absolute numbers that has come down actually over the last 2 quarters, and it will stabilize. In Q3, Q4, is when we have our performance management -- performance-based involuntary attrition period, because our performance review happens in October. And following that, there will be periods in this that will be involuntary attrition due to performance. Even including that, our numbers are lower than our Q2 -- Q1, Q2 numbers. And when you look the percentage, you are still seeing the impact of the period. And involuntary attrition, as a percentage, has gone up during Q3, Q4. And we will continue to see some involuntary attrition because in the period when there are challenges we need to happen, our performance and management system, so that continues to happen.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Viju George of JPMorgan.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just this margin variability, I wanted to understand a little bit more. I know questions have been asked around it. Why you decided to suspend guidance with regards to margins in the period, because you've seen the variability vary much? Visibility being very high, or are you not able to predict margins in your business right now?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think the variability is very high. Number 1, we are entering with the headwind. Number 2, our sales guidance we have given is lower than the [indiscernible]  it will actually negate the margin headwinds. So I tell you that our guidance was higher than our negated margin headwinds entering into the year. With our guidance, which is 6% to 10%, which we believe is a confident guidance. But at the same time, the impact of the headwinds will be higher because of the guidance range which we have chosen. Now on top of that, there are uncertainties. Uncertainties comes from the fact that some of it will take [indiscernible]. Revenue productivity has dropped by 3% during the year. We expect that headwinds will continue for a little while because our revenue productivity usually goes up when we have [indiscernible] integration to balance out some of the pressures in the business and IT operations. That, we are not seeing at this point in time, which means, if you look at it, the growth range is lower, which means we have to account very much for the headwinds we are coming in with, in combination with the Lodestone, the Lodestone impact. We have a new issue, which popped up, which is an uncertainty, which we need to account for, which is the visa oversubscription, which I believe will lead to about 40% reduction in the approvals, which we will get the day of the [ph]  oversubscription, which again is the uncertainty at this point. So because of that, there are volatilities which we expect and that is the basis. At the same time, I want to point out that there are headwinds also we are coming in with. So if the growth is above where we think it will be, that will be a way for us to negate the modest headwinds. Our aspiration continues to be the same. We will continue to focus on higher margin and higher growth, but we also have short-term volatility and challenges.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And in the back of wage hikes, no -- you have not decided on anything on wage hikes right now, that's like no model or not announced it. How are you seeing the wage hike situation for FY '14? Are you planning one? If so, when will it take effect, onshore and offshore?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we are looking at multiple things. On [ph]  wage hike, for a major part of our population, one can only [indiscernible]. And in on-site, we are going with market wages, so they get that [indiscernible] market, which has meant over the course of the year and course of the year. It will not be any more in the beginning of the year for most part. There will be a small part of that, which will happen at the beginning of the year or during the year, during some point in the year. But from [indiscernible], it will be market-based compensation, and that will get adjusted during the year continuously. We are also looking at structural adjustments on the compensation to balance out our fixed and variable compensation. So that will also happen during the next -- almost actually, I think in the next couple of months. And along with that, we're going to be, we will look at selective compensation changes. So this is an ongoing process, and as and when the decision is made, we will communicate to the employees.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So it just means that, as of now, you have not announced a wage hike of 6% to 8% or whatever they did in the course of the year. So nothing of that on the annual right now, either through the year or something like that. I just want to confirm that.", "S. D. Shibulal", "As of right now, we have not announced anything to the employees. But we will be announcing as and when we take the decision during the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Shibu, you indicated that you had project ramp issues throughout the quarter. Is there a way to kind of give us some more color? Is this widespread in terms of protocols or regions or is it specifically confined to maybe a specific sets of kind of areas? I think any color here is going to be helpful. And on top of that, did you have any project -- besides the fact that you had delays, did you have any project cancellations during the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We had no project cancellations during the quarter. We have not really lost any clients. In fact, the clients have gone up in absolute numbers as well as in million-dollar clients, $50 million clients, almost all parameters, our clients have gone up. Our growth has been actually accountable [ph]  while in [ph]  the volume growth. The revenue growth looks smaller, but the volume growth also has been quite substantial,  3.7%. As in all around, there is -- there are no client-specific issues we are faced with at this point in time. Because the general environment and the general ability to -- the volatility -- because the volatility in the environment continues to be -- continues to delay our -- delay ramp-ups as we let the new project start even after sometimes maybe it takes time for it to start. So that is where we are. We do have an on-site [indiscernible] challenge,  which is there last year because of the utilization. We have used subcontractors to bridge the gap or in new skills [ph] , not everywhere. We expect that, that will sometimes cause a delay in actually starting the trial  [ph]  program, so that we have to start on-site first. That is something which we had to continue [indiscernible]. I still did not hear the first question very clearly.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Well, so just to be clear, what you're saying here is that one of the reasons you've had some project ramp issues, some of it has to do with infeasibility to staff projects on-site just because, again, you have some -- you haven't been able to get some of those visas that you thought you were going to get. So what you're trying to tell us is that a the combination of clients not ramping on time, or as well as Infosys not being able to have the right resources to be able to staff projects. Is that the correct assumption here?", "S. D. Shibulal", "In those situations, we would use subcontractors to bridge the gap. And most of the work which has started recently has been indicated with the large franchise [ph]  phase on the deals, which we had in Q3. So with everything was that whenever we have a challenge in staffing, we will have new subcontractors to bridge the gap. But when I look at FY '14 and the consumer guys [ph] , when I look at FY '14, I would say that utilization, when you look at it, there will be a challenge.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question here, given some of the changes that Infosys has gone through during the past year, 1.5 years, what has been the feedback from your customers? Are they comfortable in terms of where Infosys is going to? And obviously, customer perception is really important in terms of their spending intention with Infosys, vis-\u00e0-vis your competitors. I think that's also going to be helpful if you can give us some feedback in terms of what your customers are saying about Infosys in terms of where it's going, going forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So in my mind, that's absolutely a silver lining. I admit, I meet about 20 clients every -- 20 to 25 clients every quarter, because I travel quite a lot. And they are absolutely convinced about our capabilities, our commitment, our people. I mean these are the [ph]  combination like [ph]  one set of people, who the client believes in and a set of capabilities that the client is eager to use. And I've -- see, we run 8,000 programs, and there are about 4 or 5 programs, which are in critical risk. That says it all. We have such a low number of programs in critical risk. And it is -- they are also extremely appreciative of the fact that we are able to support them through difficult times. They are going through difficult times. Even in the program, where there is some trouble, we will actually step in. And even when it is not even our area, we will actually step in and help the client. And our ability to support them through difficult times, our ability to work with them on all 3 angles, which is information[ph],  operation and on the product and platform side, I think it's extremely important for them. You will see that -- and in fact, that they don't see the changes actually. That's what they were telling me. And in fact, I would consider that as a complement because they did not get impacted by the change. They read about it, they [indiscernible] and the 3 offerings. But they did not see the change from an impact perspective, so I am very, very confident of the client.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandeep Muthangi of IIFL.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "I wanted to follow-up a bit further on the utilization angle. I remember you saying utilizations are low, and there is scope for improvement. One question is on, what do you think is a fair stable utilization rate for Infosys? Because I see over the past 7 years, and it's hardly been at the current level. So don't you think that utilization is already at a fairly high level? It's only been a few quarters when it was at the 70% rate. So I would be interested in your comments on that. How much more levers do you have on the utilization angle?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Our utilization will be somewhere between 78% to 82%. That is optimal range. So I'm talking about non-training population. If you are in training, you are in classroom. That doesn't really add to the staff which can be staffed on programs. Our utilizations will be somewhere between 78% to 82%. That is our [indiscernible]. And even this year, that is what -- that's our aspiration, and that's easily doable in my mind. Our utilization is substantially down at this point. It is marginally in shock [ph]  from last quarter to this quarter. It is important actually for our employees rather than anything else. You don't want 30% of your people on bench because they will be pretty unhappy about it. The only reason it will happen is because we don't want to go back on any of the commitments which we gave. We allowed everyone to join in spite of all the challenges we faced. We put them through training, and they are on the bench being ready to be utilized. So it is a positive that we have the people. At the same time, it is a negative that the utilization is low. We have also made -- already made adjustments to all of our planning models and recruitment models to make sure that this kind of a situation does not come up in the future, at least the chance of this kind of situation does not come up in the future. We have adjusted our recruitment policy between, what we call, 70-30, 70-30. That means 70% of our need coming from colleges, freshers [ph]  -- sorry, not from colleges, from freshers [ph] . However, that 70% will come in from colleges and 30% coming from just in time [ph]. So if you do the math, we will only give offers to 49% of our requirements at any point in time for the coming year. So that is really trying to make sure that these -- the chance of this kind of occurrence in the future is not there.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Okay. Just one more question, on the wage hikes, you mentioned that there are certain structural changes that you are doing with the salary structure. Can you give us insight of what will be the end result of these structural changes? Will it result in salary base actually being higher or lower or just stable, flat?", "S. D. Shibulal", "These structural changes are to balance fixed and variable. We have substantial part of our compensation in variable compensation. We want to increase the fixed of it, so we are looking at it.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "I'm sorry to harp on this a bit, but as an analyst and investor, should we be building a cost neutral kind of scenario because of these changes? I'm assuming you are not -- I'm not taking in the wage hikes that you may give at some point of time into account. Excluding that -- these structural changes, you're saying that they should be cost neutral for the company as a whole?", "S. D. Shibulal", "The structural changes will be cost neutral for the company as a whole. There will be the marginal impact, which will not be much, but please remember, I talked about the headwinds, which are coming out of the compensation increases which we gave last year. We have given promotions. There is a cost impact because of that. We will be doing various compensation activities during the year just like what we have done in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pankaj Kapoor of Standard Chartered.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Just as guidance that we have given of 6% to 10%, I was wondering if it is building in the aggressive pricing stance into this, or you think any kind of a change in our pricing stance and be incremental to  this number?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So as I said, we already [indiscernible] to make sure that the guidance is a statement of fact. If we saw [ph]  that this year, we have taken a slightly safer approach because of the volatility we have seen over the last 8 quarters. And that is building the wide range of guidance we gave, 6% to 10%. And it considers all the factors we know at this point in time. The unknown factors at this point in time, for example, I wouldn't know what will be my conversion rate on the visa applications we have submitted, which means that what will be the impact of that on the on-site cost and subcontracting costs, which is, at this point, I don't know. The revenue productivity, I have assumed that it will remain almost flat. I have accounted for the tailwinds and the 3%, which I got last year, but the environment is volatile. So I have considered all the factors, which I know at this point and taken a guidance, which in my mind is safe, and I'm confident of meeting it at this point.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Just to clarify, I mean normally, when we give out the guidance fee, assume pricing constant at the last quarter level. And hence, it becomes more of a volume outlook. So given our commentary on aggression on pricing, especially in the strategic account that you spoke of, does it mean that the 6% to 8%, which is assuming constant or a stable pricing, can actually be at -- can get changed depending on how our stance on the pricing pans out?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, in terms [indiscernible] they have factored in pricing in the 6% to 10%. There will always be development [ph]  effect of volatilities at this time this year, beginning of the next year. But I think on the pricing -- and we really looked at the mix of discretionary spend, and the discretionary spend goes up next year. And if it goes up, then it gives us the pricing part. The commoditized business is going to get more and more pricing -- price sensitive. And I think there's not much lever that we have there on the margin front or on the pricing front. Having said that on the pricing, I think we have seen a drop of about 4% in pricing with our growth trend during the financial year. And to a large extent, there are no pricing pressures in terms of clients asking for rate cuts, but there will always be these specific pricing decision that you have to take. I think a lot of it could depend on the kind of growth that we see. And if we see growth coming back and a reasonable amount of growth coming back, I think -- and the mix of business that we see in terms of our discretionary and non-discretionary spend and [indiscernible] integration, I think we would start to see the pricing getting more stable. But on a quarterly basis, it's basically the product pricing right now because the business exchanges are very, very, very significant on a quarterly basis.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Fair enough. And just on this -- moving a little bit more, is there any kind of minimum margin gating that you are looking at when you are getting into these newer kind of deals, which may have different kind of a pricing? But is there any specific margin gating that you apply it to? And if -- how that gating level would have changed, say, what was our earlier stance?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, it's not about gating. We have done the portfolio, and we realized that they need to run their portfolio in terms of the margin that we would update that over the -- in terms of the strategic line. It's our own portfolio, it's a new geography kind of technology. So there are many factors, which play into the way your pricing decisions are taken. There's no change in terms of the gating or the minimum margin leverage that will get committed. But I think each of the businesses have a portfolio to manage, and they have a certain pricing and the revenue and the pricing and the margin target that they work towards. And within that, they have the flexibility to manage what they want to manage. So I think there's no specific answer to -- or specific number that we're working towards.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "And Shibu, you mentioned that because of our portfolio being much more skewed towards the PC [ph] side, we have been taking -- facing headwind, vis-a-vis the industry. But if I look at our numbers from, even say application development on maintenance services, the revenue growth has not been any -- exciting as it is in a very low-single digit. So is there any inherent issue in our core business also on the ADM site?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Actually, there's no inherent issue in the core business in the ADM side. I actually agree with you that there was a growth in the ADM space also has been slower. At the same time, we have done major transformation in that space, and our wins in the H2, reflects some of it, and it will take time to flow through. So if you look at the clients, which we have announced, like Harley, Cisco and all that, they are all reflections of multi-tower deals, which we have won, which are pretty substantial in nature. If you look at the on-site won in the  previous quarter, it's a reflection of the KT, the knowledge transfer phase, which has kicked in. So it will take some time to flow through. And we are quite focused on driving growth in that space, but the flip side of that is it is a very [ph]  sensitive area. And to balance that, we have to grow the transformation work, which is in the discretionary space. As long as the discretionary space is challenged, even balancing the revenue productivity cost [ph]  is an issue for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kunal Changoi [ph] of Birla Sun Life Asset Management.", "Unknown Analyst", "So my question is with regards to guidance. Two quarters back, we withdrew our quarterly guidance. This quarter, probably we are reducing, withdrawing our EPS guidance. I would want to understand what -- why you not go ahead with the revenue guidance as well? What was the rationale of, at least, giving the revenue guidance?", "S. D. Shibulal", "[indiscernible] guidance has not changed. We still think that we are going through a volatile environment for many, many reasons. There's no doubt. And our ability to predict it has come down substantially. On a quarterly basis, we truly believe that we can actually predict the year fairly well. So, for example, we would look at the -- and as we will see a change in the direction, we will change because we don't want to kill [ph]  our communications to the market. In the beginning of the year, we give you guidance of 8% to 10%. And as you look at the volume growth for the year, it is 8.8%. But we believe, directionally [ph] , revenue productivity impacted our revenue, and that we ended up at 4.5%. So from a volume perspective, we did actually land almost exactly where we thought, which was between 8% to 10% with 8.8% growth. When I look at the next year -- and so I largely already able to [ph]  communicate as [indiscernible] the market. We want to be extremely transparent going into next year. We have actually [indiscernible] taken a safer approach because the volatility was [indiscernible] taking a broad range of 6% to 10% for our guidance on the revenue side. On the margin side, there are some knowns and some unknowns. And there are unknowns in the world during the year. Usually, if they are marginal, we will go ahead. But this time, it [indiscernible]. The revenue productivity is unknown because last year, if you look, we had [indiscernible] drop. The cost of hiring [indiscernible] unknown. The investment, which we need to make, we need to make. And they have won [ph]  as time goes by. Because of all that, we decided not to do a margin guidance for the year.", "Unknown Analyst", "So because last quarter in December quarter, we were probably proactive in, at least, coming [ph]  out to the markets that [indiscernible] the estimate for the December quarter probably would fall back. And this time around [indiscernible] in terms of communication with regards to the guidance for this quarter, March quarter, probably there was not -- well, we were not proactive.", "S. D. Shibulal", "I don't get the question.", "Unknown Analyst", "No [indiscernible] last year...", "S. D. Shibulal", "Probably if you look at it, the [indiscernible] revenue, we have made the EPS. But as Rajiv said, when you're trying to do this, what happens is that you end up cutting up severely [ph]  the investment sometimes. So this quarter was a tough quarter for us. Our revenues grew lower than what was predicted. We met our EPS without any extraordinary income. And with the extraordinary income, we actually exceeded the EPS. And the fact of the matter is that the net impact of our ability to take decisions [indiscernible]. Growth is the most important thing for us at this point in time. Our margin is a reflection of higher growth. And as long as our growth  [indiscernible] is lower, margin will not reflect it. So we have taken a decision that we will not give a margin guidance. We will take on the headwind, which we already have. We will factor in the impact of the unknowns, which will come in like the visa and on-site cost, and we will make the investments, and that way, we will hopefully get the growth back. So we have taken a decision to do that.", "Unknown Analyst", "Fair enough. The last question is with regards to the net additions in the headcount. How many people would we have taken over from some of the recent [indiscernible]?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have taken over people, but I wouldn't consider them as material in nature. [indiscernible] than anything else. We do not win", "[Audio Gap]", "I don't have an exact number, but it will be only in low hundreds rather than any material number.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you at the [indiscernible] over a period of time. Thanks, and have a good day. Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo of Infosys. Thank you. And over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thank you, Inva. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Infosys Q4 '13 earnings call. I'm Sandeep from the investor relations team in New York. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal; along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2014. Subsequently we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC which can be found on www.sec.gov. I'd now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good afternoon, everyone -- actually, good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for joining the call. Our revenues include for -- in U.S. dollar terms grew sequentially by 1.4% including the Lodestone acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, our revenue grew by 0.8%. On the EPS end, we did better than what we predicted. Our EPS for the quarter is $0.78 as against $0.76 last quarter. Our guidance for EPS for the year was $2.97 and we did $3.02. This was done irrespective of the fact that our revenue, we had to recast from 8% to 10% to 5%,  pricing dropped by 0.7% in Q4. There continues to be quarterly movements due to changes in the business mix as well as the pricing situation. Part of our business is under pricing pressure especially in the business in IT operation side. Lodestone integration continues to be on track on all important dimensions like go-to-market, delivery capabilities, systems and processes, finance [indiscernible], joint go-to-market proposition has been established in all verticals. This quarter, we have -- and I think after the integration started, we have 5 joint wins. We're tracking slightly behind plans on revenues and cost targets as the focus was on the above-mentioned areas -- that is integration, but which took priority over pure revenue and cost until now. Uncertainty continues in the broader economic environment. We are living in a very fragile environment. The global environment hasn't completely recovered from the downturn and the Eurozone crisis. Though the clients have finalized their budgets, we have to see if it improves the decision-making cycle, including discretionary spending.", "Today, technology is at the center of many of the key business decisions being made, whether in cost rationalization, productivity improvement, process improvements or future expansion plans. We believe that our  [indiscernible]  Services, capabilities across operations, transformation and innovation will allow us to compete and perform in the long-term. We are confident of navigating the short-term challenges due to uncertainty in the environment. I will now touch upon few specific points relating to each of our business units.", "In financial services, our clients expect their business prospects to be overall flat to down. In financial sector, the appetite for spending money was much higher 12 months ago compared to cost-conscious environment today. At the same time, we expect opportunities in the new technologies Big Data, mobility, analytics, social technologies and legacy platform organization. It's actually seen in the current [indiscernible] space, origin [ph] platforms in capital markets, loyalty and fraud management in card and payments, next-generation portals and payment apps in banking, digital channels like mobility and social media and portals for improving agent and customer experience in insurance, and we are focusing on capitalizing on such opportunities. In Retail and CPG,  [indiscernible] the business budgets are under pressure. However, overall technology spend is increasing in SAP, digital, business intelligence and new efficiency platforms.", "We are a partner for many of the retailers in U.S. and in Europe in their digital strategy. Coming to manufacturing, the budgets are expected to be flat to down in most of the subsegments like auto, aerospace and resources. Clients are investing in reducing complexity, lowering cost, increasing the speed of new product rollouts and service transformation. We see exciting opportunities in areas like digital transformation and analytics. Cloud adoption is increasing in sales and HR. Our strategies include enhanced focus on transformation and capability building, leverage our capabilities in a number of systems and helping our clients build new products. We expect manufacturing vertical to have a slower H1 and then see a pickup in H2 as large equipment in inventories get depleted in the next few months and production levels gradually pick up after that.", "In energy and utilities, communication and services, spending is expected to be down in most of the top verticals barring oil sector, energy, and win market utilities. Telecom sector continues to see its topline shrink. Gas companies are facing revenue pressure due to supply lag, and large utilities are seeing revenue decline due to unfavorable rate case outcomes. However, we see different drivers of spend in different segments. Telcos are spending to improve their customer experience and introducing new product lines, leveraging LTE. Energy companies are seeing regulatory pressure on ESS and compliance, which is creating opportunities for us in production optimization and data and knowledge management. Utilities are investing in Smart Grid and focusing on driving cost efficiencies.", "We operate in multiple offerings. On discretionary spend, we expect it to be higher in CY '13 over CY '12, that is calendar year '13 over calendar '12 in RCL and manufacturing. In RCL, we see demand for services around digital commerce, SAP-enabled transformation and analytics, along with strong demand for omni-channel commerce skills around digital marketing and personalization. In manufacturing, we see deal closure rate in discretionary areas being higher than the year back. However in energy, communication and services, decision delays are becoming more common and deals are becoming smaller with faster ROA requirements. In FSI, which is our financial services segment, we expect discretionary spending to be higher in certain pockets through allocations, though allocations would be small initially. In our products, platforms and solutions area in Q4, we added 12 wins. We had 12 wins and added another 7 clients, taking the total client count to 79. Our journey in this area received strong validation this quarter. Infosys' Cloud Ecosystem Hub won the 2012 Golden Peacock Award for the most innovative products and service. Our edge through the business platforms, 1 NASSCOM Business Innovation Award for 2013. Forrester Research has positioned Infosys as the leader in its enterprise mobility services report. Ovum, the global analyst firm, recognized Flypp Digital Experience Platform as a well developed ecosystem of services, with large depository of apps and monetization process.", "The road ahead is challenging, environment has changed significantly recently. There are significant macroeconomic factors affecting all the economies, which will have an impact on growth and pricing. The biggest challenge for us is to get growth back, and for that, we need to make investments in our business. Due to the volatility and dynamic nature of the factors, it'll be difficult to predict margins in the short-term. And therefore, we have only given a revenue guidance. The revenue guidance for next year -- actually the current year is 6% to 10%. We have broadened the guidance to 6% to 10%. I believe that this is a safe guidance given all the information which we have today. We are confident of meeting the guidance at this point in time.", "Now let me hand over to Rajiv Bansal to give a color on the financial performance.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Good morning, everyone. As Shibu said, our revenues for the quarter grew at 1.4% over last quarter. Revenues, excluding Lodestone, was 0.8% on a sequential basis. Our EPS guidance for the quarter was $0.73 based on annual guidance of $2.97. And we have achieved $0.78, taking the total yearly EPS to $3.02, as against the guidance of $2.97. Our operating margins for the quarter, including Lodestone, was 23.6% and excluding Lodestone is at 24.8%. For the year, we have achieved operating margin of 25.8%, excluding Lodestone at 26.3%, which signifies a drop of about 250 basis points without Lodestone over last year and 300 basis points including Lodestone over last year. Our volumes grew 1.8% sequentially and 8.8% annually. This quarter, we have seen a pricing drop of about 0.7% in the quarter. We believe our utilization is still at about 68.5% including trainees and 71.4% excluding trainees.", "When we started the quarter, we spoke about the gaps in our guidance, which were to be filled up with planned ramp-ups in the recent wins that we had and the deals that we had the pipeline. Some of the deals ramp-ups didn't happen as we had planned and some of the deal closures which we expected during the quarter got delayed because of the delay in client decision-making. Historically, the fourth quarter has been soft for us and this is also the start of the budgeting cycle for the client, and which probably resulted in the delay in budget release and decision-making. For the year, our pricing has dropped by about 3% including Lodestone and about 4% excluding Lodestone. Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year is about $4.4 billion during the year. The rupee has been extremely volatile against all the major currencies, and we also had some impact of cost currencies during the quarter.", "As Shibu said, we have given a guidance of 6% to 10% for next year on product revenue. And considering that such a volatile and uncertain environment that we're in, with the revenues moving on quarter-on-quarter basis, we felt that it was better not to given an EPS guidance, considering that we need to make a lot of investment in our business in the long run. We are in the middle of execution of our Infosys 3.0 strategy, which requires us to look at business strategy over a long period of time and make those necessary investments. So it was felt that we need to go ahead and make those investments. We have to get the growth, we have to make some adjustments on our cost model. And considering all of the volatility and uncertainty in the environment, it would do better not to give a range of the EPS guidance for the year.", "With that, I'll throw it open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nitin Mohta of Macquarie.", "Nitin Mohta - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to understand, if I look at the low end of your guidance, the growth is going to be quite similar to what we have done in fiscal '13. How do I look at that disconnect? Was this the commentary on discretionary spending better in CY '13? Also, if I look at the last 6 months, the deal wins and the new logo that you have added, I would have assumed that that would give us more confidence for next year. So just your thoughts there.", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. I think the first point on the discretionary spend, actually what I said was that the higher discretionary spend in calendar '13 in 2 -- only in 2 areas, RCL -- that is the retail and manufacturing, there are challenges in other areas. So I did not say that the discretionary spending will be higher in CY '13, in calendar '13 all around. That is one. Now we have seen a volatile 8 quarters for various reasons, whether it is volume or whether it is revenue productivity, we have seen volatility in 8 quarters. Even if you look at the this year, let's take a look at the year just past. We have given a guidance of 8% to 10%, our volume grew by 8.8%. But our revenue only grew by 4.5% because we lost revenue productivity of 3%. So the volume landed right where we thought it will land, and we had assumed the flat pricing in the beginning of the year when we gave the guidance. But the volatility in the revenue productivity created bumps. So in Q3, the volume was 1.5% up and the revenue productivity was 1.8% up. It contributed towards 4.2% growth, whereas in Q4, the volume is up actually more than Q3, 1.8%. But we had a situation where we took revenue productivity down of 0.7%. So if we look at the last 8 quarters, it has been pretty volatile for us because of the portfolio, because of the environment. So we have taken a slightly safe approach to the guidance, broaden the guidance, it's some 6% to 10%. It is true, at the lower end of the guidance, the growth will be only 0.5%, but at upper end it will be point -- 2%  [ph] quarter-on-quarter. Given all the information we have at this point, we are confident of meeting the guidance. Where exactly it will end? We will see as we go along.", "Nitin Mohta - Macquarie Research", "And if I can squeeze in another one. I understand it's been a tough environment to operate and just the volatility around the business verticals, the service offerings, are there some of them, which are more difficult as you see it now versus 3 months ago, just in terms of the volatility and uncertainty? If you can point out or highlight which are the areas which are causing it to be as a difficult proposition to call out the future?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I clearly see higher issues in telecom, telecom sector, because I think they are starting to see topline shrinkage or they are seeing -- they're continuing to see topline shrinkage. So that is a sector where we have considerable revenue in one of our large verticals. And volatility there will directly impact us. Financial stability continues to be indecisive, for lack of any other term. Indecisive for us and also very cost-conscious. Because when we look at the future, we have to also -- we have looked at it in 2 different ways. We have to look at it from a volume growth perspective, at the same time, impact, because of the revenue productivity changes. So while the decisions are maybe being taken but they are very cost-conscious, that has an impact on our revenue productivity. So I would consider these 2 sectors.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I was curious about your infrastructure management business, or RIM business. How big a focus is that for you? How are the contracts laying out? Historically, these tend to be lower margin upfront and rising margins over time, is that what you're experiencing? And is that some of the pricing pressure that you're seeing?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So let me say a few words and then I'll hand it over to Kakal. So infrastructure will be a big focus area for us. If you look at the second half of last year, we had the Harley-Davidson win, which we disclosed to the public to which we acquired -- the people and the process have happened in infrastructure both. We have set up a development center in Milwaukee just to support that deal and to expand it for other clients. With that, let me now hand it over to Kakal to give a much better color on infrastructure.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "We're not hearing on our end.", "Chandrasekhar Kakal", "Are you able to hear me now? Kakal here.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Chandrasekhar Kakal", "Okay. Yes, I'm just continuing from where Shibu left. On the infrastructure management space, we have seen considerable progress in the last 1 year. Earlier, our positioning was only to remotely manage the infrastructure or the RIMs that we serve which is a marginal play. Whereas now, we have developed the partner ecosystem and we have been able to take the end-to-end responsibility of the infrastructure management starting from data center management to asset management to the remote management of the infrastructure as well. So some of the examples are actual work in Harley-Davidson, BMW and few others are a reflection of our new positioning and ability. In terms of the revenue sharing, the margin and all that, of course, it's an ecosystem partner, ecosystem play, we have to share the revenue with a few other partners as well but that makes us complete in terms of our offering and the clients are looking at us for integrative sourcing which involves infrastructure management as well as application management and in some cases BPO as well, which result in our ability to focus on large deals and have a long-term contract, which is a  [indiscernible]  and multiyear kind of a thing. In terms of infrastructure management, it is also possible to operate more from offshore. Now on-site percentage will be lower than the other services. So hence, we will be able to gain some margin leverage back from the off-shoring. Otherwise, it's a competitive space and with the end-to-end responsibility that we are taking now, we are trying to manage and the growth -- balance between the growth and the margin in this infrastructure space. I hope that answers your question.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Great. My other question is around the wage assumptions for next year. You gave the wage increases later in the year in fiscal '13. Are you going to go back to a normal cycle of the April cycle? Or what should we assume?", "S. D. Shibulal", "All right. Did you get the answer from Kakal?", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I got the answer on infrastructure management, and I was curious what the timing of any wage increases might be in the coming year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me hand it over to Tan Moorthy, Head of HR.", "Srikantan Moorthy", "Yes. So we have done compensation changes since last October for various segments of the population. We started with India. We went on to the United States to do market-based corrections. And we'll continue that process throughout the course of this year, both across geographies and across levels of people in the organization. We're also planning a change in the structure of the salary components to bring in much more simplicity in the way it's calculated. Thank you.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Are you planning to go back to the April cycle? But -- or are you sort of out of that traditional cycle given what happened last year?", "Srikantan Moorthy", "So since the corrections and changes happen as we look at the data coming in from different markets at different points in time, we are not going through a specific cycle for everybody. It happens as required in the geographies and for the levels.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I have 2 questions also. I wanted to go back to the difference between the original guidance of roughly 4% sequential growth versus the 1.4% delivered. Was the primary cause of that -- was it pricing or was it weakness? You called out telecom and financial services. Because you specifically mentioned that volume growth was okay. But if you could just list in order of priority, what were the most material reasons for the variance between the original guidance for the quarter and the results please?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So actually I would like to go back a little further and then start from there. See, in the beginning of Q3, we had given -- we had said that when we look at H2, there are some challenges and there are some revenue gaps, which we will try to address. And we have tried to address it during H2. In Q3, the revenue volume grew by 1.5% and simultaneously, the revenue productivity went up by 1.8%. So it resulted in 2 -- 4.2% growth. We still had some of the gap left, right? When we ended the quarter, we will have visibility probably 95% of the business, and there is about a 2.5 month period in which we need to actually bridge that gap. In Q4, what has happened is that we actually grew volume by 1.8%. But we lost almost 1% of our revenue because the revenue productivity dropped by 0.7% and we took a cross-currency impact of 0.4%. If we had not, on that we will have ended up somewhere around 2.8%, including Lodestone, even though we should have been -- the guidance would have been about 3.4% or 3.5% including Lodestone. So we would still have been in that gap, but we would have been better off. So the volatility of the revenue productivity impacts the revenue even when the volume grows, so volume grows. I'm not saying that the volume growth in Q4 was completely enough, but the 1.8% volume growth itself did not reflect back on the revenue totally because of 2 reasons. Number one, the cross-currency impact of 0.4% and the revenue productivity impact of 0.7%.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So in this space, by the time you gave -- from the time you gave guidance to the time you recorded results was roughly 70 days. How is it that you had such material change in revenue productivity? And was it changing in pricing terms? Or was it just pricing or was there something else? Was there any contracts that you had to incur an unusual loss in? I'm just surprised it was that the big of a variance in the space of about 70 days.", "S. D. Shibulal", "There are no seminal events which led to the revenue productivity. There is no one single event, if you're asking, there is no one single event which has led to the shift. Even in Q3 actually the revenue productivity went up by 1.8%. In fact, if you look at Q1, I think the revenue productivity dropped by 3.5% or so, if I remember right. So the revenue productivity has been volatile. See, if you look at last year, our revenue productivity went up year-on-year by 2.2%. This year, the revenue productivity has gone down by 0.3%. So the revenue productivity has been stable in the past when the environment has been stable. Now the environment is not that stable. There are 2 factors, 2 or 3 factors, that impact our revenue productivity. Number one is the pricing itself. The pricing in our business and IT operations business [ph], some part of that business and IT operation is under pressure, so that impacts revenue productivity. So when you execute on deals where you have a less than average pricing, as the time goes by, they get into the system and shows up. Number two is shift in portfolio, but there was no shift in portfolio -- material shift in portfolio in Q4. So it will have -- most of it will have been pricing. Occasionally, you can see an impact because of overruns and things like that, but there are no such events in Q4 which is material in itself.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well I want to just have one more. That was actually my first question. My second is if you could just talk about margins. I think investors are surprised about the margin degradation as well and the forces that drove that sequential change in margins and what investors should be thinking about. Is this -- how should we be thinking about margins if we look at the upcoming quarter in particular? I know you don't want to guide the margins. But if you could just address what are the most material variables that are going to drive margins here in the quarter to help us understand whether margins are going to go up, flat, or down.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the most important factor which impacts our margin, there are 2 or 3 important factors, but the most important factor is growth. Because growth is a driver for margin, because growth creates the utilization. Utilization creates balance between revenue and cost, and that is one driver for growth. Second one is -- that's one driver for margin. Second one is revenue productivity. And revenue productivity directly impacts margin because a 3% drop will result in a 2.1% impact on margin, depending on plus or minus, it goes either way. So these are 2 or 3 things. And utilization has an impact on margins. We are definitely entering the year with a headwind on margins because of incurred costs which is going to get accounted -- not accounted, that's not the right word to use. These are -- I know -- I'll give you an example. So for example, we did compensation increase in the middle of the year in last year, that means we have only taken cost for half year for compensation increase in the last year, so that the full year impact will show up this year. We are doing a compensation increase in U.S., market correction in U.S in February, which means we have only taken incurred cost for 2 months last year and 10 months will come this year. That is still billable $140 million of impact. Then we are taking a one-time charge for next 12 quarters or so because of the Lodestone acquisition, which is about $40 million for the year. The Lodestone integration is in progress, but driven by -- the Lodestone is a consulting company and their margins will be in single digit. It will become normalized over a period of time when the offshore gets built to support that on-site margin of the consulting margin. And that should build over a period of time and the revenue multiple should be somewhere around 3x to 4x. We already have 5 wins in the current quarter because of Lodestone-Infosys combination. But the impact of the single-digit margin on the Lodestone revenue will show up in our margins. So there are some short-term headwinds. And we are also entering the year with headwinds. Then there are some 2 or 3 areas where we will see impact on -- there are 2 or 3 areas where we have potential impact. So for example, revenue productivity, there will be a tailwind because of the sequential drop which we have seen. That is one. Number two is that we need to make investments because we are -- growth is our biggest driver. And that means we have to create growth which means that any investment which is required for growth, we need to make. We also need to make investments in some of the new areas. We have a -- we are going through a visa application process. And the visa approval will not be 100% of our applications because of over subscription. We do not know the results of that yet, so that may also have an impact. H-1 visas. So there has been uncertainty which is also which we are seeing. That is the reason we decided not to give a guidance for the time being.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Manik Taneja of MK Global.", "Manik Taneja - Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., Research Division", "I wanted to check, given the fact that manufacturing has been a vertical that's grown significantly ahead of company average for the last 3 quarters -- last 3 years. Do you envisage a similar scenario for FY '14 and also similar comments for the other verticals?", "Rajiv Bansal", "So let me start with manufacturing and engineering. So I think what we have done in the last 1 year is to, obviously, refocus some of our energies into areas where we think we will have the fastest and best return. We have grown our European business, which was lagging on the back of some very large deals. One, of course, is in the public space, which is BMW. And there's a large deal, Harley, in the U.S. as well. So we are focused on large deals. We think -- when we look at the budgets -- keep this short because my other colleagues are also here who can talk about their sectors. If we look at the budgets, it's tending to be flat to slightly lower than last year. But we think that given our presence and continuing expanding presence on Continental Europe, we will see some traction in Germany especially, and we will continue to be quite dominant in the high-tech sector. There are certain sectors that are completely under-tapped for us like resources, chemical business or industrial manufacturing, which again back -- on the back of certain defined strategies, we have been able to break through. So we expect to continue to be -- to continue to grow and be a fairly large contributor to the guidance that we have given. B.G.?", "B. G. Srinivas", "B.G. Srinivas here. Quick view on the financial service sector. As we look ahead, entering the quarter 1 of this fiscal year, we are definitely entering with a decent pipeline in terms of both existing ongoing business, as well as both outsourcing deals and some of the interest our clients have shown in transformation opportunity. So compared to where we stood at this time last year, we are more confident in terms of the growth rate. The sector itself -- banking, capital markets, as well as insurance -- is still going through challenging times in terms of their growth rates. There is definitely opportunities and cost optimization initiatives within the client organization. There is a bit of discretionary spend on 2 areas. One is regulatory income plans. The other area is on the digital transformation, multichannel analytics and right platforming, as the clients call them, in terms of decommissioning legacy and optimizing applications on a newer platform, re-architecting what they have today. So these are the opportunities which we see. And while the market will continue to post challenges in terms of growth rates, but we are relatively well positioned to tap into current opportunities as I outlined.", "Manik Taneja - Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., Research Division", "Sure. And B.G., another question for you with regards to Europe. Last quarter, a commentary from you guys was that you've seen a lot of maintenance spending opening up for Indian IT companies. Do you still continue that view?", "B. G. Srinivas", "In Europe, in a macro environment, yes, there are definitely challenges. But in terms of specific business opportunities across sectors, financial services, manufacturing, retail CPG, energy utilities, we are still seeing opportunities. We have now more than 200 clients within Europe. We continue to invest in the big markets, Germany, France and U.K. We have also seen a significant uplift with acquisition of Lodestone, particularly in Germany and Switzerland, across manufacturing, CPG and life sciences. So given the investments we made and given the existing client sets where we are mining opportunities and also focused on certain key clients, which we want to acquire, we are reasonably confident of increasing our market share within Europe. Also to remember is the fact that Europe continues to be fragmented in nature of its offering -- the maturity curve within each of these countries vary. But we are tailoring our specific go-to-market initiatives within each of these countries and then we do believe that, that is starting to pay dividends. Also, the fact that most of this business, at least in the Continental Europe, is consulting-led. We definitely have a lead in terms of the investments and the capability we developed. So that's where we stand. And again, given the current situation, the pipeline also, while across sectors vary, we do have a reasonably good pipeline at this point in time.", "Manik Taneja - Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., Research Division", "And if I can chip in one more question. This question was for Rajiv. Just wanted to get a sense on the margin decline that one has seen in FY '13, almost close to a 300 bps decline in margins. If you could break that up in terms of impact from pricing, in terms of pricing, in terms of utilization and in terms of impact from Lodestone on a full year basis?", "Rajiv Bansal", "I think if you look at year-on-year basis, primarily it is pricing. Pricing, actually, in Lodestone has dropped about 400 basis points and that impacts the margin by roughly about 280 basis points. And margins, excluding Lodestone, have dropped about 250 basis points. It's primarily revenue productivity and then the pricing. Other than that, we also had impact of cross country. I think during the year, if I look at our cross-country impact, it's roughly about $60 million year-on-year. So -- but all that we have been able to manage with all the cost management that we've done during the year. But I think it's primarily pricing which has driven the margins down.", "Manik Taneja - Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., Research Division", "And what could be the sensitivity to utilization for us in terms of margins?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, utilization, if you look at -- including trainees, has kind of remained flat year-on-year. So utilization did not really have a large impact on operating margin this financial year though our utilization was low, but including utilization, it was almost similar last year also.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "There's so many factors here that are -- you've mentioned that are impacting the margins today. And perhaps if we step back, this industry has always been able to operate at a higher level than its global peers. And your model's evolving and I suspect others in the industry will as well. And that evolution feels like it's larger -- or migrating, at least directionally, towards the global players like an IBM or Accenture that, obviously, operate with a different margin structure. Can you just help us understand how we should view your model over time vis-\u00e0-vis what you're doing with the business, where the industry stands so we can just get a better idea of kind of how this plays out, not necessarily in fiscal '14 but over a longer period of time?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So there is no doubt that our business has evolved because today our business has a lot more discretionary spend in our -- especially in the case of Infosys because if you look at the average industry -- average IT industry from India, you may not see it because the NASSCOM averages somewhere between 17% to 18%, to my knowledge. Whereas, our consulting and system integration revenue is something like 32%, so -- which means that our dependency on the discretionary spend is definitely high. There are some cost pressures in the business and IT operations space. So our strategy is actually to balance growth both -- we have to grow both sides because growth is all around. But at the same time, if we can grow our consulting and system integration space where there is better pricing, probably that will help us increase our revenue productivity. Now regarding the margin, David, it's so important when I said that we had a year of low growth. Growth has been the driver for our margin all these years. Growth creates some scale, growth creates utilization, growth creates onsite/offshore mix, all kinds of things. So there have been -- and so we had a year of low growth. We grew by 4.5%. On top of that, we had a year where the revenue productivity came down by 3%, right? And partially mix change, partially pricing change, so both, right? So I am -- I will not consider this -- I know I will not consider this is a circular [ph] trend for us because I know that in the short term, I have some more headwind to face. I gave the list of things which we are entering the year with, and on certain things which I have in my hand because of the plan -- lack of clarity on visa applications and things like that. But if the growth picks up -- if the growth picks up, our margin should benefit. So in my mind, there is -- while there are short-term challenges, long term there is still potential for margin improvement. But for that growth has to pick up for us. And so -- and that is exactly what we're trying to do. So that is why we have taken this very, in my mind, very drastic decision to actually not give the margin guidance, make the investments, gain a focus on growth and then we believe that once the growth picks up, we will have better margin capability.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. So I think I follow the logic and that makes perfect sense what you're doing. I guess what I'm trying to understand though is that your global peers are growing at a much slower rate than you in getting margin expansion. And it's -- obviously, there are changes that you have undertaken with your model that are costing you margin. But as you kind of evolve the model, do you envision the mix changing, the structure of the industry changing that may in fact also change the margin structure of the business? Or do you feel that you can sustain these relatively high margins once you reach an equilibrium?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, I'm going to -- Rajiv is going to answer that and then if you need, I'll come back.", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, it's very clear that the traditional businesses or services business is going to see more and more pricing pressure in the coming years. And that is where we started on our journey of Infosys 3.0 where we put our expectation of having 1/3 of our revenues coming from Products, Platforms and Solutions, which will help us keeping the pricing premium and getting higher margins. So those are long-term goals and that is the reason why we started on the journey. But in the immediate future, I think, if the growth comes back, it helps us manage the payment module much better. Today, because the growth today is very choppy and it is kind of very unpredictable, it is very difficult to plan and get the benefits of the economic model that we have. And so I think in the near term, the margins would be under pressure depending on how the growth spans over the next couple of quarters. But I think in the long run, if we are able to execute on our strategy well, I think we should be able to keep the margins at much higher than the industry average.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I see. And just when you were talking about pricing pressure, you said this operation is where you're seeing it most. Is it isolated there? Or are you actually seeing it in other sectors as well?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Well, the pricing pressure, see -- today there's a growth issue. There's a -- discretionary spend has kind of disappeared from the market and the discretionary spend is where we get the pricing premium. So on the commoditized business, there is pricing pressure. I think across the board, we are seeing all deals with -- the clients are also under pressure and clients really want to cut down their cost. They want the maximum service to be delivered. They have to keep their shop running so the pricing is going to be under pressure in that -- in the business operation -- IT operation. But I think as we see the discretionary spend pick up, I think the business mix would take care of the kind of pricing pressure that we see in the business IT operations.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I see. And just one last question. Obviously, you've got a very, very healthy balance sheet and cash position. Are you thinking more broadly about capital allocation and how you may return more of that to shareholders? Or are you pretty -- kind of happy with where you are right now?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, so we do debate this. There's a question [indiscernible] for the board our cash strategy and why do we need $4 billion in our balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents. The fact is that we are in the execution phase of  [indiscernible]  Strategy and our expectation is to have 1/3 of our revenues coming from PPS. Now we also understand that the 1/3 target would not be met only through organic means because that would take decades to meet because other businesses also are growing. So we have to look at acquisitions in that space in a big way. And as you know, that space is where the multiples are pretty high. So I think during the initiatives [ph] of the strategy, the cash is most strategic to us today than it has ever been before. We also said that we have -- we're looking at right targets, we are looking at a lot of companies right now, as we speak. So we believe in the next 12 to 18 months, this cash is very, very strategic for us to accelerate our journey on the PPS part.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "My first question is just on the large deal front. I think you had mentioned that there were some delays in getting those ramped. Could you talk a little bit about what those delays were, what caused them? And then why did -- why -- also on the execution front, on the Lodestone front, it came in, I think, a little bit below what you were expected. Maybe you could talk about why that was lower than you expected as well.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So actually if you look at it, it's true, we had a pretty strong win streak. We have closed about $950-plus million of PCV and large deals and transformation deals. The large deals, which we won in Q2, Q3, went into execution more in Q4. And that is reflected in our on-site effort percentage going up, the effort growth in Q4. What happened was that the offshore has not picked up and that is delayed than what we thought and some of it is client decision making and some of it is the way it happened over a period of time. So while the deals have closed in on-site indicating [ph] has started, the offshore is  [indiscernible] pick up and many  [indiscernible]. But in answer to that and the second was about Lodestone, Lodestone, we are a public company and they are a private limited company. The funding policies are extremely stringent for us, and we follow very stringent accounting policies. So I think when we consolidated our accounting policies and apply to them, which delayed the recognition of some of the revenue. And we very much focused on integration rather than on -- during the integration process, we focused very much on the integration and really joined deals rather than on the revenue side so that also impacted it by a couple of million dollars.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So do you expect now, kind of as we look at next year, do you expect that the large deals, the ramp time of those will resume? And do you expect -- I know you used the word delayed with Lodestone. Do you expect that revenue to pick up as well? Are we through that? Or is there some client-specific stuff going on? Because the pipeline seems to be continuing to increase but the execution remains relatively volatile. Just trying to reconcile that.", "S. D. Shibulal", "There are no client-specific issues in Q4 or in Q3. There are no client-specific issues. The execution we are expecting to pick up and that we have factored it in, but we need to win a lot more deals going forward and that is what we are focused on. The pace of ramp-up may be slower in this volatile environment. And I can't say that the pace of ramp-up, which we have seen, which is lower than usual, will materially change in the short term. That means we have to win a lot more deals to create that growth and that is what we are focused on. The Lodestone, now we have moved them fully into our accounting policy so I don't expect that to be -- and we have begun a new process in place, which are very much in line with our own processes, so that we don't have any revenue -- we will use our own revenue recognition policies to recognize the revenue, and we will have the processes to support it. So I don't expect that to be there. The joint venture already happened, so I think we have 5 joint wins over the last 4 or 5 months. After the integration started, I expect that momentum to continue.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. One last one for me, just on the margin front. You had talked in the past about keeping margins in a tight band, I think 100 basis points. And I know you didn't give any guidance on earnings. Should we disregard that commentary or the passage of sort of that margin band? And then as you look of those margins going forward, can you give us some idea of what you're thinking about internally for an investment schedule? And how that would impact the margins as you look at it from a seasonality standpoint, et cetera? Again, we're just looking for color and I wanted to see if that previous margin guidance would hold at all.", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, at this point, I will not hold the previous margin guidance because we are entering a year which is slightly different than what we have done in the past in many years. We have a headwind because of the lack of growth in the previous year plus the commitment which we have made. So we have a $140 million headwind because of the compensation changes we have made, which is going to be newly accounted in the coming year. It is the impact of compensation changes, which we made midway in FY '13, which will show up in FY '14. Then the $40 million charge which we are taking for Lodestone from an acquisition perspective, because we only paid out $200 million. The remaining is being charged under the P&L. We have an impact because of the Lodestone revenue being in the consulting margin band. Consulting revenues usually come within the single-digit margin. And it will take time for the offshore component to get built because the buildup of the offshore component is one is -- something like 1:3 to 1:4 and that will take some time, so there will be an impact because of that. Now these are known things and there are a few unknown factors also. Number one is the investment which we need to make. Because growth is extremely important for us, we want to invest and we will invest into growth. We will not compromise on investments so that the growth will continue to pick up, number one. Number two, there is an uncertainty on visa applications. We have applied for a certain number of visas, but we know that there is a series oversubscription for visas, which means that we will only get a percentage of the visas which we applied, somewhere between 50% to 60%, which will need us to recruit on-site or to subcontract. So that will have an impact, as well as there's a tailwind from the revenue productivity drop. So there are known set of factors, which I clearly quantified. There are unknown factors, which are in the evolution mode and that is the reason. Because of the uncertainty, we decided that we will not give -- and we want to make the investments. So because of the uncertainty -- because of those factors, we decided not to give guidance on the margin at this point.", "Stephen R. Pratt", "Shibu, this is Steve Pratt. If I can just add on Lodestone. We're very picky about acquisitions, but the early -- I guess, my early diagnosis of Lodestone is that it's a really great company. The people there are terrific. Ronny [ph], his global leadership team, I think, are very good with the clients. And I think there's -- it's a -- the integration is going very well. We've actually moved some of the people from consulting in the U.K. into Lodestone, and it's a very seamless integration. So I'm very bullish on the prospects of that going forward, but it will take a while for them to get used to our model. And of course, as Shibu said, they're lower margin initially standalone but the long-term intent is for them to drive higher margin work in flow-through.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Because Steve added, I just want to clarify this -- there is absolutely no doubt in our mind regarding the quality of the acquisition or the quality of revenue. When we implement, we have very stringent accounting practices and revenue recognition practices. They are not a public company before. They are now a part of a public operation. We are implementing our stringent accounting practices and revenue recognition practices. That delayed the recognition of some amount of revenue and that could be because of lack of documentation, which is not important to us but it is important to -- it is not important to them, but it is important to us. Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing there which is of any material nature.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandip Agarwal of Edelweiss Securities.", "Sandip Agarwal - Edelweiss Securities Ltd., Research Division", "Sandip here. One or 2 quick questions. First, on the  [indiscernible]  Vertical side, almost all the verticals are looking slightly weak, maybe -- although you have given some bit of optimism on the manufacturing and retail, but overall, this 60% to 70% of the vertical outlook, which has been provided, is a little muted. Secondly, as you rightly said, that 1:3 or 1:4 is the follow-on revenue on the offshore side from a consultancy business, which is easier to come. But if our strategy is to continue acquiring small companies necessarily to build up with PPS model and the consultancy model, then obviously this kind of pressure may continue for a longer term than being in short term. So if you can address these 2 issues, it will be great. And thirdly, on the utilization front, I understand that this is not very aggressive of a little of which have been issued. But at the same time, even at the current level absorbing, what [indiscernible] we will get? Will it be okay to assume there is a sharp up move in utilization in the CRM next year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "And so it is true that when we acquire it, it will have some impact on our margins temporarily and then we have to work towards normalizing that margin and it will take time. In the case of consulting, that is even more true because the back end has to be built; that 1:3, 1:4 model, has to occur.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "The last thing we did, one of this was expected, some of it in Australia. Today, we get 5% of our revenue from Australia and the 1:3, 1:4 happened over a period of time.", "Operator", "Excuse me, Mr. Shibulal, we lost your voice in between. We couldn't hear you. If you could please repeat.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So which part I...", "Sandip Agarwal - Edelweiss Securities Ltd., Research Division", "We have not heard you -- any of your answer.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Oh, really? Let me start again. So on the 1:3, 1:4, it is true it will take time and there will be short-term margin impact. And any acquisition, there aren't many companies with our margin structure, right? So any acquisition which we do will be margin dilutive short term because otherwise we can't do -- there aren't that many companies with our margin structure. There are  [ph] smaller companies with our margin structure. I was also saying that we have done one of these before, which was [indiscernible]  Australia, and today, we get 5% of our revenue from Australia and we have built the 1:3, 1:4 model. And the margins are -- they are definitely -- in fact, it is above average, which means it has been accretive to us. Are you still on the line?", "Sandip Agarwal - Edelweiss Securities Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, yes.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Okay. Now on the recruitment's end, we are not doing recruitment but we are honoring all the offers which we gave, which will add another 10,000 people into the organization. The utilization has inched up. If the growth picks up, our utilization will improve much faster.", "Sandip Agarwal - Edelweiss Securities Ltd., Research Division", "Sir, on the vertical side, the question was like 60%, 70% of the verticals are looking, as of now, a bit flat and negative. So what -- how should we see that demand environment coming up?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So when we gave the 6% to 10% guidance, we have factored in most of these things. The demand environment is weak because you can see it in U.S. and in Europe and everywhere else. Significantly, there is also mix. It is not like we are getting a consistency on the demand environment. Some days it looks good, some days it looks bad. And there are cascading effects of any event. So we have to focus on the newer areas, which -- where we are seeing demand in mobility, cloud, analytics, social commerce, consumer activities -- those  kinds. Again, that is where we are making the investments. We are making investments into those areas which are either through intellectual property or through capability, we are making investment into those areas.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, and thanks for the insightful questions. We look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day. Bye.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, members of the management team.

Thank you, and over to you, Mr. Mahindroo.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Linda. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Infosys Q1 Earnings Call. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining us today's on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2014. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov. I would now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the earnings call. Let me begin by giving an overview of the current quarter, the recent quarter, Q1. We have reasonably -- we have done reasonably well in Q1. We had 2.7% growth quarter-on-quarter on reported basis. In constant currency terms, growth was 3.4% quarter-on-quarter. Our growth was driven by retail and CPG and manufacturing, energy verticals and Americas region. Our top end clients grew by 4% in Q1. We added 66 new clients and 10,000 employees growth during the quarter. Our attrition during the quarter was 16.9%. Our margin was flat sequentially as the benefit of a weaker rupee was offset by material impact of last year's compensation increase and other investments in the business.", "I will now talk about some of the key drivers and opportunities that we have seen in different verticals. Financial services continues to see challenges with the downsize in the industry, creating pressure on budgets and spending. Cost reduction continues to be the primary focus area, leading clients to focus on optimization and consolidation of IT and operation spend, focus on compliance-related spending, vendor consolidation, info system modernization, information management and cloud are the key initiatives with several in the financial services sector. Insurance companies are focusing on customers in the city, with a strong focus on business and technology programs concerning digital and information management. Pricing trends in this sector are challenging as clients continue to tighten their belt. With industry still seeing tough times, we believe that we will continue to see volatility in these sectors.", "In Retail and CPG, we see increased vendor consolidation and focus on reducing cost of operations in the Americas region. In Europe, we see demand for omnichannel commerce in retail and demand for ASP, mobility and platform capabilities in CPG. In APAC, retailers are focusing on omnichannel integration and expansion in the regional markets. In Life Sciences, we have seen continued activity towards mergers and demergers, and business and IT initiatives being taken in support of the same. Overall, in retail and CPG, due to continued focus on reducing nondiscretionary spend, even though there are opportunities to work with clients in many areas, we are seeing more aggressive procurement practices and requirements from vendors who have higher risk appetite.", "Coming to manufacturing, we see various trends by sub-verticals. [indiscernible] companies are focusing on cost optimization, asset-light operating model and expansion in the emerging markets. ISCs are focusing on process transformation to enable new license model and subscription commerce. Other companies are focusing on connected verticals, digital consumers and leveraging power of the emerging economies. Aerospace companies are focusing on increasing production levels to meet order backlog. Clients are looking at doing more with less and looking for convertible [ph] ROA for spending programs. Discretionary spending is under pressure for small projects in Europe. Pipeline of large deals in manufacturing is not as robust as we would like it to be.", "In energy, utilities and communication services space, spending is under pressure in most areas, primarily due to revenue challenges facing the clients. Pressure on IT spending is visible and the foremost focus on cost reduction and the operational efficiency in telecom, steep reduction in budgets in large energy clients and in the ability of large utility companies to drive recurring increases, thereby, helping their revenues. Pricing is broadly stable through -- though large deals are coming at a lower margin due to competitive intensity in the market.", "Coming to large deals, most of the pipeline is driven by clients looking at restructuring existing spend with a bias towards ADM and infrastructure management. We have won 7 large outsourcing deals in Q1: 6 of the 7 deals were in Americas, 3 of the 7 were in financial services, 2 were in manufacturing. The pipeline for -- of deals continue to be stable though closure rates and pace of ramp-up on the deals are uneven.", "We continue to operate in a volatile environment. As I mentioned earlier and during the vertical commentary, client willingness to spend on discretionary areas is limited. Key leading indicators like decision cycles and pipeline of deals are improving, but not pointing to a sustainable improvement over a long period of time. There is an acute focus on cost cutting and optimization. Many of the large deals, as I said, are rebates and rebates usually come at a very price-sensitive range. There are uncertainties in the political path. We have seen the immigration bill in the U.S. take shape over the last few months while there is a long way to go. We have seen regulatory changes in Canada. We have seen regulatory changes in Australia [indiscernible]. While these changes are going on and clients are interested in these changes, they will not express any change in their decision-making.", "Cost currency challenges are also impacting us. This quarter, we have lost $13.7 million because of cost currency movements. Because of several factors, while we have done reasonably well in Q1, we have not changed our yearly guidance. Our yearly guidance is 6% to 10%, and we remain cautiously optimistic about our future.", "Now let me pass on to Rajiv to give you details on financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Shibu. Good morning, everyone. Just to give you highlights of the financial performance. Our revenues for the quarter grew by 7.8% sequentially in rupee terms and 2.7% in dollar terms. On a constant currency basis, our revenues grew by 3.4% quarter-on-quarter in dollar terms. Our EPS for the quarter is at INR 41.54 paisa, a growth of 3.7% quarter-on-quarter. In dollar terms, our EPS was at $0.70 as against $0.76 last quarter. The operating margin for the quarter was at 23.5%, same as Q4 '13 levels. The rupee depreciated by 4.9% quarter-on-quarter to INR 56.56 for the quarter as against INR 53.93 last quarter. The benefit of rupee depreciation was offset by residual impact of last year's salary hike and recently announced hike for sales employees, effective May 1.", "We continue making investments in the business, which also had an impact on our margins. Our net margin for the quarter was 21.1% in rupee terms as compared to 22.9% in Q4. The decline in net margin was due to lower exchange gains on nonoperating side of the income and also because of tax reversal that we got last quarter because of R&D benefits. We had very strong volume growth this quarter. Our volumes grew by 4.1% quarter-on-quarter though our realizations dropped by 0.7% during the quarter due to adverse cross-currency impacts. Realizations are flat on constant currency basis. Our utilization for IT services, including trainees, increased to 70.7% in Q1 as compared to 68.5% in Q4. Excluding trainees, we are at 74.3% utilization in Q1. We are given 8% compensation increase to sales force, effective May 1. We have also announced 8% increase for our offshore employees, effective 1st, July and 3% on-site folks, effective 1st, July, other than who are already covered in the last quarter's salary hike cycle. This is likely to put an additional pressure of roughly about 300 basis points on our margins for the coming quarter. Our cash and cash equivalent, including available-for-sale asset, was at INR 4.054 billion. Cash initiative continues to be strong. Operating cash flow, as a percent of net profit, is at 100% this quarter.", "We saw significant volatility in currencies during Q1, with the rupee depreciating by 9.4% against the dollar from end of March to end of June. In spite of that, we were able to limit the impact of currency on our nonoperating income to positive $3 million. We have outstanding hedges of $1.173 billion as of 30th, June. We have maintained our guidance at 6% to 10%. Our guidance, if restated based on our predictions rate, will be at 7% to 11% since we lost roughly about $72 million in FY '14 revenues due to exchange rate movement between what we assumed last quarter versus this quarter. Our current guidance is restated based on FY '13 exchange rates, would be at 7.4% to 11.4% since we have lost roughly about $104 million between year-to-year cross-currency movements. Our rupee guidance of 13% to 17% is at an exchange rate of INR 59.39 for the next 3 quarters. With that, I'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ankur Rudra of Ambit Capital.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "My first question is on realizations or employee productivity. If I break it up in terms of offshore productivity and on-site productivity, they should have -- there seems to have been a decline in offshore productivity despite a mix change in favor of more discretionary line like ADM consulting. Can you help me with why the mix change will not lead to an increase, if not, flat offshore realization?", "Rajiv Bansal", "If we look at the mix change, the mix has changed from 31.4% last quarter to 32% this quarter, and if we look at realizations in constant currency, they're at -- they don't change from last quarter. They are 0%. Since there has been momentum between onshore and offshore, our on-site volume growth is 5.8% this quarter as against offshore volume growth of 3.3%. This will result in an on-site per capita gain, 0.1% increase on constant currency basis and a decline of 1.6% in offshore per capita. I think these are quarterly movements. I think on a quarter-to-quarter basis, depending on the project starts, which projects starts, which project are ramping up, which projects are ramping down and which -- what are the realized rate of the new project that we signed up, I think you will see quarterly movements between onshore and offshore realized rates.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, so nothing to read from here despite the fact that consulting and AD grew -- they should have increased? I mean, I was talking about excluding the on-site share.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes, if you look at the consulting growth, that is actually what has led to the very high on-site volume growth, and if you look at our on-site per capita, realizations have remained the same, reasonable offshore. So we have signed -- as we have announced, we have signed a couple of large outsourcing deals in the last couple of quarters, which are on the ramp-up right now, and those are the ones where you'll see some impact showing up on the offshore realization rates.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Fair enough. On those deals, the deals that are ramping up right now, I understood they had greater component of some of the more commoditized service lines such as application, maintenance and infrastructure, which however, were relatively muted this quarter. Should we understand that those deals will take longer to ramp up, and hence, you don't see the full impact this quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So if you look at our large deal this quarter, we had 7 wins in the second half of last quarter. We had about $1 billion of win, but it is important to note that these wins get realized over the period of 3 to 5 years. So the $1 billion win of last year, if it gets fully realized this year, will be about 20% of the revenue which is $200 million. We have seen occasional slowdowns in the ramp-ups, but the ramp-ups have happened, as we thought, for most of the large deals from last year, but the realization is over a period of 3 to 5 years.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Just lastly on the demand scenario, I know you highlighted that it remains a bit volatile. But if I look at the commentary from -- for example, last night, from some of the industry consultants, highlighting the fact that there is a bit more of optimism around the project pipeline right now for the second half of CY '13, your guidance for the remaining quarter does not reflect that fully.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So even if you look at our own performance, we have done reasonably well this quarter and our wins are also pretty good. We have large deals, 7 large deals this quarter that's roughly at $1 billion. And the challenge is if you look at our last 3 quarters, we have seen volatility in our own performance: Q3, Q4 and Q1. One quarter is not a secular trend in our mind. There is a journey to be taken. There are multiple initiatives in progress. Growth with -- high-quality growth is our focus. We are definitely focused on it and enthused about it. But at the same time, it is a journey to be taken. We have seen volatility over the last 3 quarters. We also articulated some of the volatilities. For example, the Australian change in regulation will actually create a delay and a stop in our ability to staff. The lead times of staffing will go up. So there are some such implications also we need to consider. Considering all that, we are cautiously optimistic about the year and our guidance, we did not reset, but as Rajiv said in constant currency terms, it will be 7% to 11% or 7.4% to 11.4%.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, just lastly on the debtors side, I noticed that your debtors have increased quite a bit. I understand part of this could be because of the quarter end rates versus the full year rates, but it still seem to have gone up about from a quarter ago and a year ago period. Is this because of the India contribution rising or was there something else?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, it's -- I think it's not only because of the India business. Our day sales outstanding has gone up from 64 days last quarter to 66 days this quarter and that is what is showing up on our debt is going up. Again, I think we are very focused on keeping our DSOs low and this quarter was an aberration of that. I think we are very focused on collecting our money on time from the clients. I would also like to say that this also includes a credit period that we give the client. This is not from the date when the invoices are due, but this is from the date when we retain work for the client. And to that extent, I think considering where the environment was, I think in some of the large outsourcing deals and some of the clients in certain segment have been asking for a high credit period of late, and that is having effect in our DSO. But I think we, as a company, are very focused on ensuring that we collect our receivables on time, and I think we would see a lot more return in that in the coming quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Can we get a -- maybe some color on margin trends, I guess, for the next view quarters? And then maybe you can also talk about the leverage and the model that will help you -- would help you sustain marginal levels down the road?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So our margin this quarter is 23.5%, the same as Q4. We had brought some benefit out of the rupee depreciation, but that was adjusted towards the residual impact of the on-site compensation, which we gave last year, and we have given a compensational hike for our sales force staff starting May 1. So the benefited was offset by these 2 factors. We have given another compensation increase this year, which is 8% offshore and promotions, and that will have an impact of $260 million for the entire year minus the sales impact, which we have already taken, which means for the next 3 quarters, there will be a $187 million impact, and that would have an impact of 300 basis points to our margin unless we do other actions to negate it. We have multiple rewards. We are focused on making sure that the nonproductive effort in the organization is reworked. On-site, offshore ratio is a lever. Our on-site ratio has gone up to 32% right now, which is -- it has gone up by 2% over the last 3 to 4 quarters. The more offshore work which we do, we will have better margins. Our utilization is moving up. It has moved up from 71% to 74%. Our optimum utilization can be anywhere between 78% to 82%. That should give us a lever on the positive lever on our margins. As trainees come in, our average compensation goes down. That's some of the levers. We have about 4,000 trainees right now and a few more to join over the next 1 year. So these are the levers which will allow us to adjust our margins. But as I said, the compensation increase will be immediate. The Q1 compensation itself has impacted us, and the remaining impact will happen immediately. These levers will get adjusted only over a period of time. Pricing is stable quarter-to-quarter. We have seen a 0.7% drop, but that is because of the cost currency movements. So these levers will have to be worked. This a journey to be taken. This is a lot of work to be done. We have action plans in place, but we have to realize them over the next few quarters.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And just a small a follow-on. I saw that Europe was down sequentially in a constant currency basis. Was that mainly because of the telecom vertical? Is there anything -- can you add some color on that?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There is no single event which will cause that. It is not a secular trend in my mind. It's a quarter-on-quarter aberration and a few couple of projects that will come to an end in Europe, but there is no secular trend.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Yogesh Aggarwal of HSBC Securities.", "Yogesh Aggarwal - HSBC, Research Division", "I just have 2 questions if I may. Firstly on Lodestone, the revenues increased sharply from $70 million to $90 million, and in constant currency, I'm sure it will be even higher. And that it seems like largely a realization per head increase because people have increased by only 100. So can you just please elaborate on that? Last quarter, you mentioned some accounting policy differential between Lodestone, and overall, Infosys. Was it something to do with that or there's anything else? And secondly on attrition, it's almost running at all-time high, excluding the 2 quarters of hiring, so just wanted to get some sense how do you -- is it -- how do you make sure it doesn't impact client satisfaction and delivery? And since the wage increase announcement, has there been a drop in attrition. So just provide a help on these 2 questions.", "Rajiv Bansal", "I think Lodestone has been doing quite well for us. As per plan, we acquired it about 2 quarters back and we have integration plan in place and we have a roadmap for how we are going to synergize that in terms of how to get downstream revenues and upstream. So I think, we -- as per plan, I think we have seen good traction with our clients -- with our current strategy with Lodestone and Infosys. In terms of the revenue growth this quarter, I think some of them that is talked about last quarter in terms of the accounting policy integration -- because of integration and the accounting policy impact and -- but Lodestone has done well this quarter and we hope to see Lodestone continue to do better as we go along. On the other part, I'll ask Steve to answer.", "Stephen R. Pratt", "Yes, so just a little more color on Lodestone. So first of all, we're excited about the acquisition. That's a key part of our strategy to expand our consulting expertise in the Continental Europe to have a seamless set of services to our clients in Europe. What we did is to combine the management consultants that we had in the U.K. into Lodestone. We saw a onetime increase in revenue. But even despite that, Lodestone is doing well. We have some work to do on integration and in cleaning things up a little bit. But we have a lot of confidence in the acquisition, and it's already paying dividends with our clients as we have a lot of joint wins in Continental Europe, and I think our clients are excited about it and their clients are excited about it.", "S. D. Shibulal", "On the attrition side, Q1 is generally when we see a spike in attrition because of the -- because people leave for education, higher education in Q1. Our absolute number of people leaving in this Q1 is same as the last year Q1. We have given compensation increase on-site, offshore. We have given promotions. We have addressed many of the employees' concerns. So I'm hoping that the attrition trend will be negative going forward. But generally, Q1 is when you see a spike because of a higher education attrition.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandeep Muthangi of IIFL.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Sorry to follow-on with Lodestone thing a bit, but a clarification will be very helpful. So the $20 million incremental revenues that you fined [ph] Lodestone during the quarter, are you saying that, that -- part of it happened because of this incremental revenues from adding U.K. consultants into Lodestone because I thought it happened last quarter?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. See, some of it is because of the accounting that is -- of our last quarter. I think we had an impact of roughly about $3.5 million, $4 million last quarter because of accounting issue, which has kind of come up this quarter. And the-- another thing is because we are moving people and we're integrating as we go along so there has been some people movement in U.K. last quarter. There have been some movement of people in Germany, in U.S. So I think we are integrating our operations with Lodestone as we speak, and there is a people movement happening. There's some projects being delivered out on both Lodestone and Infosys. So some of the Infosys work would get delivered out to Lodestone. They had low utilization so the utilization had started going up, and last, it is getting affected, the revenue numbers for this quarter.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Right. So why I'm asking this question is because Lodestone is part of Europe. If I want to look at the performance of Europe without Lodestone because I cannot quantify the impact of all these changes, Europe looks particularly bad x Lodestone. It looks as if it is down some 8%, which the worse performance for Europe. It's not that bad even during FY '09 and '10. So I just wanted your comments on Europe's performance x all these Lodestone-related changes.", "S. D. Shibulal", "This quarter, that's really -- U.S. has done much better than Europe. We had a couple of large transformation programs coming to an end in Europe and -- but at the same time, as I said, I will not consider this is a secular trend. We have not lost any -- we will not -- had any single client issue or multiclient issue or industry-specific issue in Europe in this quarter. So we have done better, really better, number one. Number two, a few programs in Europe came to an end, and there are other programs on the way, but we are seeing a blip. I will not consider this as a secular trend.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Just one more question if I may. I was noticing the performance of Infosys Public Services absolutely has been quite good. Can you give me some color on what's happening over there? What are the kind of the deals that you have won in the ramp-up?", "Ashok Vemuri", "This is Ashok. So on the back of our District of Columbia health exchange program, we have also been able to gain traction on some of the other health care transactions, one, of course, is in the public space. So we've had a good traction. Of course, the entire Affordable Care Act itself is going through significant changes, and some of the states may actually decide to go back onto the federal exchange, which will actually mean that health exchanges by themselves, as an opportunity, will get reduced as compared to where we thought it would be.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pankaj Kapoor of Standard Chartered Securities.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "So just want to get a view on the rupee depreciation that we have seen in the last quarter. Do you intend to reinvest all that potential currency gain this year also, or should we expect some kind of a pass through into margins?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. If you look at the rupee, rupee has been very, very volatile this quarter. If I look at on an average-to-average basis, rupee depreciated by about 4.9%. If I look back on a closing rate between March 31 to June 28, it has depreciated about 9.4%. If I look at intra-quarter movement, the depreciation is about, what, 12.4%. By the way, this will take a view on rupee to a -- as we speak. Some -- it has helped us in some way in our margins this quarter because of all the headwinds that we spoke about at the beginning of April. I think some of it has got negative by the rupee depreciation. We have -- at this point of time, our subsequent guidance that we have given is at INR 59.39 for the next 3 quarters. We'd have to see -- wait and see how the rupee plays out in the subsequent quarters, but it will definitely help us negate some of the impacts of the wage hike that we announced effective 1st July. But some of the rupee benefits also were negative on a cross currency movement. If you look at Australian dollar, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it depreciated about 5.5%. On a period end, this has depreciated by 11.4%. So I think some of the rupee benefits are also getting negative by the cross currency movement, and what's always left is kind of slowing -- is helping us manage our cost in terms of this wage hike that we have announced.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "So Rajiv, like we had a similar kind of a movement last year as well and we didn't see that coming and reflecting in the margins. So my question was that this year again, if rupee went -- hypothetically stays at INR 59 also, does this still would be close to 4.5%, 5% kind of appreciation -- depreciation in the currency? So I was just wondering that if you will use the rupee lever to counter out some of the headwinds that we see. So that's what I understand I believe you will do. The second is that, I think in the TV interview, Ashok mentioned that we are trying to mitigate any kind of a potential fall out of the immigration bill. So in this area again, should we expect some investment in terms of increased on-site hiring going forward?", "Ashok Vemuri", "Let me take that. Yes, I think the point being made is that, the immigration bill, it's a comprehensive immigration reform which has probably found the most traction in the U.S. after a very long period of time. It has passed through the Senate. It is in the house in a very different form. It's obviously very hard to predict what the U.S. Congress will do, and we definitely cannot go into the Congress and decide what that particular bill will be. And there are certain provisions in that bill, especially on outplacement which have an implication for us. And we have to be -- obviously, we are forewarned about it in the sense that it's public knowledge about the loss provisions, and we have to prepare ourselves for the eventuality that, that will become a reality. And that's essentially what we are doing in terms of our planning and strategy. But I think it is a little difficult to call out and say what is the kind of investment that we would need to make. Clearly, we are going to continue to progress on investing to stay relevant to our clients. We have to drive towards profitable growth, and therefore, that will mean changing, to a certain extent, some of the ratios that we have which have gone up from an on-site perspective.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Okay. So Rajiv, just then again, like trying to sum it up in terms of a margin picture for the next 3, 4 quarters, do you think that we are at that trough level, or do you think that the margins can slide further? Of course, next quarter, we have the headwind of the wage hike, which can possibly get neutralized by the currency. But over the next three quarters, do you think that the margins can bounce back and be at a similar 23.5% kind of a level or you see further down cycles?", "Rajiv Bansal", "The very fact that we haven't given a margin guidance or EPS guidance was that it's very difficult to -- because we have a lot of headwinds on the margin and it's very difficult to predict how the currencies would move. If we look at the wage hike that we announced in the month of July, effective July, it will impact margins by roughly about 300 basis points. We had spoken about some of the headwinds in terms of the pricing because a lot of large outsourcing deals which are coming out, which are apparently rebids, are coming at lower price points. The discretionary spend of the government, the budgets for discretionary spend are coming down. And the business mix change would also impact your realized rates, which would also put a pressure on the margins. If you look at my on-site effort mix this quarter has gone up from 31.4% to 32%, which also impacts the margin. Now the positive side of the rupee depreciation and the utilization uptick, because if the growth is good, then we should be looking at utilization going up further in the subsequent quarters. Now how much of the negative will get offset by the positive is something that we'll have to wait and see. So it's very difficult to put a number, but I would say that we have headwinds in the margin front. We are very focused on high margins and superior margins, but I think that is something that we'll have to do. They're the last initiative that we've undertaken to help improve our margins. But I think -- I would not take a guess on the margins for the subsequent quarter at this point of time, but all I can say is that we would -- we are trying our level best to ensure that the impact of the margin is minimal because of all the headwinds that we have. And, to that extent, the rupee is helping us, the cross currencies are not really helping us on that front.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "And just one last one, small clarification. Can you put a TCV to the 7 large deals that we spoke of?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So that will be somewhere between $600 to -- $600-plus million.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mitali Ghosh of Bank of America.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "First is just a follow-up on the question that you've been asked earlier. Just on Lodestone, I wanted a clarification that you mentioned about $3.5 million to $4 million from the accounting issues -- the accounting-related revenue recognition from the previous quarter. But could you also call out how much was -- was there also some kind of inorganic growth from like you said the U.K. consultants joining on?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. See, now that we have integrated, it's very difficult to track revenues by which employee is delivering how much revenue and who's moving from where to where. And that's the whole idea of running it together. We are approaching the clients together, we are selling together and we are delivering our services together. And it's not very proper to break that revenue between how much is getting delivered from Lodestone original employees who moved to us and employees who have moved to them, because to date IL [ph] is using Lodestone for a lot of front ending Projects. They're using them for staffing on certain projects. So I think it's not appropriate to look at revenues from that perspective going forward.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sure. But there's no inorganic component because some additional people joined? That's the only point I wanted to clarify.", "S. D. Shibulal", "No. See, there would be movement because when we said that we are integrating the 2 companies, there are movement of employees happening. So as we had said in earlier quarters, that we'll have a European consulting practice merged with Lodestone, and the movement is happening as we speak. So there was U.K. which was transferred in last quarter. Some part of Germany front offices got moved from this quarter. So that integration is part of the integration roadmap that we have, and we are on our integration roadmap. So you would see some movement of people happening back and forth. But I think the way we are looking at business is not in the perspective of how the revenue is moving depending on the original people and the people who have moved. I think it's one integrated company and we are looking at revenues and revenues growth from a complete integrated model.", "Mitali Ghosh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of where they're aware of how the different revenue buckets grew, I think it would be useful if you could call out maybe how the quarter panned out versus your expectations going into the quarter in terms of ramp up or any verticals or discretionary spend? And I understand that a quarter's trend cannot be extrapolated, but it would be useful to understand how it was versus your expectation.", "S. D. Shibulal", "On the IL [ph] side, see, as we said, this quarter we have done reasonably well. If you remember our guidance, it's up 6% to 10%. We have the growth somewhere between 0.5% to 2% quarter-on-quarter for 4 quarters to retail at upper end. And that in Q1, we have done 2.7%, actually, 3.4% in constant currency terms which is higher than the 0.5% to 2%. But as I said, there are some headwinds so we remain cautiously optimistic.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Viju George of JPMorgan.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My question again pertains to Lodestone. I mean, you've had this jump of $30 million which is almost a 30% -- $20 million, which is almost a 30% increase Q-on-Q on Lodestone. Now one is that, what has led to this? Because at the same time, you are also cautious about consulting discretionary spending, et cetera. That's one. Two is that, how has this come about because the manpower addition seems to be just about 10%, 12% on Lodestone. So I'm just curious to understand what drove this -- in more concrete detail.", "Stephen R. Pratt", "So Lodestone is doing well. As Rajiv said, it's on plan and there's a lot of people movement happening in these quarters, so I wouldn't expect that percentage of growth going forward in quarters, but we're confident in the strategy. Overall, for consulting and systems integration, on a constant currency basis, we grew 6.3% quarter-over-quarter. In U.S. dollars, we grew 5.5% quarter-over-quarter. So it's -- it were -- it was a reasonable quarter. We're -- I think it was a good beginning to a new future. And -- but the thing that we're most excited about is if you look at the business value that we're adding to clients that we're -- we are actually creating more and more business value and that ultimately lead -- will lead to better financial results for us. And so -- and Lodestone is a key part of that. Because for us to serve global clients, we need to be strong in Continental Europe.", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, I think that Lodestone number -- let me just clarify it once more. The Lodestone growth of $20 million has come from 3 different aspects. Number one, as Rajiv said, because of the integration which was in progress over the quarter, there has been some accounting-related shift which happened. But please remember when something gets shifted, there's double the impact. So a $4 million shift actually will true up at $8 million this quarter, that's number one. Number two, people getting moved don't reflect completely in that quarter. So for example, last quarter, some people who are moved maybe at the second half or the end of the quarter and that will get reflected much more in this quarter. So that's the second part. Third part is the growth itself, right. As Steve said, they are on plan with the growth. So there are 3 aspects which contributed to this. Number one is the accounting leadership, and it actually shows up as double. And then, people movement which have happened during the quarters, through the quarter last quarter, but the full impact will be seen this quarter. And the third is the additional revenue.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rahul Bhangare of William Blair & Company.", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just a quick one. Rajiv, can you help us quantify the puts and takes, the individual puts and takes, to the operating margin this quarter?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Could you just repeat it once again?", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Can you help us quantify the individual puts and takes so utilization increase, the rupee depreciation on the operating margin?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Sure. If you look at the margin this quarter, the operating margin has been at 23.5%, same as last quarter. The rupee depreciation on an average basis by about 4.9% could mean uptick of about 1.2% on operating margin. I had a wage increase of last quarter, the full quarter impact coming this quarter, which was about negative 0.6%. The promotions that we gave in Q4 of last year, the wage hikes related to that was given this quarter which has an impact of 0.2% negative. We gave sales hikes to salespeople this quarter which was a negative of 0.2%. RPP [ph] drop of 0.7% having impact of about 0.5% on the margin, [indiscernible] this quarter which has an impact of about minus 0.4% on the margin. The utilization went up from 68.5% to 70.7% which helped us in the margin about 0.9%. So if we look at all of these, being able to manage our margins and being able to keep it flat. So there has been some positives in terms of rupee depreciation, in terms of utilization uptick. There have been some negative in terms of the full impact of the wage hike given last quarter coming this quarter and also the wage hike and the promotion hike that we gave this quarter. So I think these are just how the market [indiscernible] concerns.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pavin Shah [ph] of Ecura [ph] Securities.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes, can you talk or lay on what's your plan for headcount growth and the BPO performance, there's been a big drop in profitability, so what's going on there?", "Unknown Executive", "This is Gotham. I think from a revenue standpoint, we grew about 14.5% from the first quarter of last year to this quarter. We were -- we maintained our operating margins at about 21%. I think typically, we've actually added close to about 8 new clients and a lot of the transition work has started. So in this business, as you probably know, in the initial phases, there is some amount of impact. But I think, over the course of the year, we remain reasonably optimistic about maintaining the margins that we have.", "S. D. Shibulal", "On the headcount growth this quarter, we have added 10,138 crores and 575 crores net into the group. In IL [ph] alone, we added out of that 10,138 crores, IL added 5,251 crores, and the net addition 1,182 crores. As you know, our utilization is still below our expected range, so we will continue to recruit based on utilization and business needs.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ashwin Mehta of Nomura.", "Ashwin Mehta - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, I had a question on our offshore pricing trend. Given that we are indicating that the deal pipeline is more rebid-related and which could come at lower realizations, and we have already seen, over the last 6 quarters, a declining trend in our offshore pricing. Do we see that trend continue especially in light of the cautiousness on the discretionary side of things?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So quarter-on-quarter, blended pricing has remained stable, but offshore has declined marginally. It is true that most -- if you read the industry reports, you can clearly see that most of the large outsourcing deals most -- not most actually, a fair percentage of the large outsourcing deals which are out there are rebids, and rebids are generally price sensitive. In any case, what happens with the large deal is that they are margin-dilutive in the beginning, or revenue productivity dilutive in the middle -- beginning. Our objective is to make sure that they are margin neutral over the life of the program. And there is a lot of focus in doing that through automation, reuse, optimization of talent, on-site/offshore ratios, and various other levers which we can use. So when you have a large number of large outsourcing programs starting up. And as you can see, we have $1 billion in the second half of last year and about $600 million in this quarter. It will have an impact but we are focused on interventions which would make the margin neutral over a period of time.", "Ashwin Mehta - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And my second question is on the fact that discretionary services application development and consulting have done pretty well for us, but we seem to be sounding cautious on them going forward. So if you can just give an idea in terms of the nature of work in these and whether that's not of a recurring nature that makes us cautious?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So discretionary spend is not recurring, right? Discretionary spend is not recurring. In fact, we have very large programs which will run its course over a period of 12 to 18 months. These will be large transformation programs. Today, we will start our consulting, go on to mostly implementation, one of the ERP packages. And eventually, we will continue to maintain those packages over a period of time. But the large transformation rupees will come to an end. So it's moved, that 34% of the revenue, we will have to continuously feel on an ongoing basis. We have done reasonably well this quarter and that reflected in multiple services. Our focus is to make sure that our growth is balanced across our large offerings. And you will see that 2.7% growth flowing into all of them. But when we look at our own performance over the last 3 quarters, we have seen volatility in our own performance and some of the challenges we outlined. So that is what -- that is the basis on which we should remain cautiously optimistic. And we felt that 1 quarter is not a secular trend and this will be premature for us to declare that it's a secular trend and change our guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I was curious if the -- your competitors have changed their approach to business given the potential for immigration reform in United States. I mean, if they have been using that threat of immigration reform competitively against you in pitching deals in the U.S.?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So our plan, we do understand that this is an industry issue. This is not an issue for a specific organization, specific company or organization. It as an industry issue. We have been very focused on having conversations with our clients. Our focus will be to make sure that there is no service interruption. That requires a joint action plan between the client and us. As you know, this immigration bill is in flight so we can only plan at this point in time. We are not -- at this point in time, we don't know what will be the final bill, what shape the final bill will be. At the same time, we are creating contingency plans with ourselves and with our clients. And our clients do understand that this is an industrywide issue.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My other question is around applications outsourcing. What kind of pricing are you seeing in this run business at this time?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So if you read the industry reports, there is a fair share of large outsourcing deals which are rebids. And rebids usually come at -- rebids are price sensitive. So as I said, our focus is to make sure that, while they may be margin dilutive in the beginning, they are margin neutral over the life of the program. That require us to focus on increasing productivity, increasing quality of deliverables, increasing efficiency, doing automation, implementing reuse and tools. So yes, they are price sensitive, but our focus is to make sure that they margin neutral during the life of the program. But they do show up. When there are multiple offsite programs in the ramp-up stage, they do show up in our margins.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandeep Shah of CIMB India.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "Just firstly, can you break down how we are looking at a 300 basis point recall of the wages in the coming quarter because as per my calculation, it looks like it's much lower. It should be lower than this because some part of the wage inflation has already been covered in the May. And even from the coming quarter, the on-site wage inflation is not for the 100% of the employees, but part of the [indiscernible].", "Rajiv Bansal", "So if you look at beginning, 8% wage hike in offshore this year, and that is effective July. So if we look at my total Indian expenses, they're roughly at about 15.5% of revenues and 8% of that is what I can recall. And then you also have lateral hires this year which would typically come [indiscernible] wages post hike. So on the on-site, you're getting 3% wage hike for your on-site folks. And if you can just add up the numbers in addition to plus all the new people who have be going out for the on-site, for the revenue growth will be going at higher wages compared to what they were. It will typically come to about 300 points impact.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "And is it possible to give us a color, percentage of the on-site employees -- is it possible to disclose the percentage of the on-site employees getting hike effective July?", "S. D. Shibulal", "It's -- we're not giving numbers of employees who are getting hikes in July but the whole of offshore, everybody has been covered in our year cycle, sales folks and all the people in substreets [ph]. So I think and so that average hike is 3% on-site and offshore is 8%. Average hike in sales is 8%. And it will add up to about 300 basis points impact in the subsequent quarter.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "And just the last question, discretionary business, earlier, we were saying that it was in a stop-and-start mode, but it looks like the commentary is a little better versus Q-on-Q. So do you believe the predicability on the discretionary side of the revenue has improved a bit, may not be to a maximum level, but it has been much better versus what it used to be 3 to 5 months back?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I wouldn't say that there is a material improvement because there is -- if you look at different segments, different segments are going through different set of challenges and while we have seen a reasonable growth in Q1. And maybe there is a marginal improvement. In U.S., there is definitely commentary of positiveness, but in our mind, we would like to see a few more quarters of secular trends before we declare it as a material improvement in the environment.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nimish Joshi of CLSA.", "Nimish Joshi - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "One question. I mean, last 3 quarters you've see a lot of volatility on either side, and in terms of performance, in terms of what's the stock price and result. So is the management really worried about this volatility which happens because this tends to keep away a lot of long only investors away from the stocks? And also do you think that you, yourself, are surprised at what came up at the end of the quarter because each time probably what has come up has been at variance to what has been the management commentary to the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I mean, there are 2 parts to this. We are looking for predictable performance. That is if you look at our business, one of our business pillars is predictability and we are definitely hoping for predictable performance. But the fact -- the reality is that we have 34% of our revenue coming from discretionary spend. Discretionary spend business needs to be continuously filled. We need to have that business because we have to build million dollar[ph] clients which means we have to have that business on a continuing basis. So that creates some volatility and volatility, because of the discretionary spend, [indiscernible] if the environment is volatile. So that is one. Then, for example, this quarter, we took a hit of 0.8% of the growth just because of the cross currency movements. Otherwise, our growth in reported currency would have been 3.4%. So there are these challenges, but I can tell you, our objective is to create predictable growth. Now talking about the commentary, in Q3, and I said the same thing that 1 quarter is not a secular trend. And we need to see a few quarters before we declare this as a secular trend. And that is true even in this quarter. Yes, we have done reasonably well. We remain cautiously optimistic. I will not consider 1 quarter as a secular trend. Our -- we are working -- our focus is to create predictability. But the reality is these factors I have laid out but we will continue to focus on creating predictability.", "Nimish Joshi - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "And just a quick one, another one question, is obviously we've seen some top layer changes where Basab has left. So do you foresee more such changes or do you think this is a one-off and then you will be announcing a replacement whatever is the new plan?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So in the interim, Ashok has taken over Basab's responsibility and right now, he's handling it. The rest of the questions that you asked are matters internal to Infosys. And when there is a change, you will be the first to know.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was our last question. I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone for being a part of this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you, members of the management Team. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you."]}

I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore.", "Joining us on today on this call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with a brief remark on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2014. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the earnings call. Thank you very much for joining the call.", "Let me begin by giving an overview of the recent quarters, Q1. We have done reasonably well in Q1. We had 2.7% growth quarter-on-quarter on reported basis. In constant currency terms, growth was 3.4% quarter-on-quarter. Our growth was driven by retail and CPG segments and manufacturing, amongst verticals, and Americas by region.", "Our top 10 clients grew by 4%. We added 66 new clients during the quarter. We added 10,000-plus employees, gross additions, during Q1. Our attrition during the quarter was 16.9%.", "Our margins were flat sequentially from Q4 to Q1. The benefits of a weaker rupee was offsetted by the residual impact of our last year's compensation increases and investments we made in the business.", "I will now talk about some of the key drivers and opportunities that we see in different verticals. Financial services continues to see challenges with the downsizing in the industry, creating pressure on budgets and spending. Cost reduction continues to be the primary focus area, leading clients to focus on optimization and consolidation of IT and operations spend. Focus on compliance-related spending, vendor consolidation, infrastructure modernization, information management and cloud are the key initiatives visible in this sector.", "Insurance companies are focusing on customer centricity with a strong focus on business and technology programs concerning digital and information management. Pricing trends in this sector are challenging as clients continue with belt tightening in schedules. With the industry still seeing tough times, we believe we will continue to see volatility in this sector.", "In retail and CPG, we see increased vendor consolidation and focus on reducing cost of operations in Americas region. In Europe, we see demand for omni-channel commerce in retail and demand for SAP, mobility and platform capabilities in CPG. In APAC, retailers are focusing on omni-channel integration and expansion in the regional markets. In Life Sciences, we have seen continued activity towards mergers and demergers, and business and IT initiatives being taken in support of the same. Overall, in retail and CPG, due to continued focus on reducing nondiscretionary spend, even though there are opportunities to work with clients in many areas, we are seeing more aggressive procurement practices and requirements from vendors to have a higher risk appetite.", "Coming to manufacturing. We see various trends by subverticals, either companies are focusing on cost optimization, asset-light operating models and expansion into emerging markets. ISCs are focusing on process transformation to enable new license models and subscription commerce. Auto companies are focusing on connected cars, connected vehicles, digital consumer and leveraging the power of emerging economies. Aerospace companies are focusing on increasing production levels to meet order backlog. Clients are looking at doing more with less and looking for quantifiable ROI for spending programs. Even in this segment, discretionary spending is under pressure. Pipeline of large deals in manufacturing is not as robust as we would like it to be.", "In energy, utilities and communication services space, spending is under pressure in most of the areas, primarily due to revenue challenges faced by the clients. Pressure on IT spending is visible in the form of focus on cost reduction and the operational efficiency in telecom, steep reduction in budgets in some large energy clients and inability of larger utility companies to drive rate card increases, thereby hurting their revenues. Pricing in this segment is broadly stable, though large deals are coming at the lower margin due to competitive intensity in the market.", "Coming to large deals, most of the pipeline is driven by clients looking to restructure existing spends with a bias towards ADM and infrastructure management. We won 7 large outsourcing deals in Q1. 6 of the 7 deals were in Americas, 3 of the 7 were in financial services, 2 were in manufacturing. The pipeline of large outsourcing deals continues to be stable, though closer rates and pace of ramp-ups on these deals are uneven.", "We continue to operate in an uncertain macro environment. As I mentioned earlier in my vertical commentary, client's willingness to spend in discretionary areas is limited. Key leading indicators like decision cycles and pipeline of deals have improved, but at the same time, not point to a sustained improvement in discretionary spending. There is an acute focus on cost cutting and optimization, which creates a downward bias on realization of -- per-person realization. There is uncertainty on the political path, final outcome and timelines of the immigration bills in U.S. We have not seen the bill impacting clients' decision making. Though some clients are focused on mitigation plans, they have expressed their optimism about our ability to provide them uninterrupted services.", "Cross currency challenges have become more acute since last quarters. This quarter, we have lost $13.7 million in revenue due to cross currency challenges. Because of the above factors, we have kept the full year guidance unchanged. Even though we grew faster in Q1 than the 0.5% to 2% growth, which was needed a quarter back to meet the upper and lower end of our guidance, it is too early to upgrade guidance after just one quarter.", "With that, let me now pass it on to Rajiv to give you details on financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Shibu. Good evening, everyone. As Shibu said, we had a reasonably good quarter. Our revenues for the quarter grew sequentially by 2.7% in dollar terms. On a constant currency basis, our revenues grew 3.4% quarter-on-quarter. Our EPS for the quarter is at $0.73 as against $0.76 last quarter. Our gross margin in Q1 were flat at last quarter's level of 34.9%. The operating margin for the quarter were at 23.5%, same as Q4 '13 levels.", "The rupee depreciated by 4.9% quarter-on-quarter to INR 56.56 from Q4 levels of INR 53.93. The benefit of rupee depreciation was offset by an additional one-month impact of last year's onsite salary waging -- or hikes, and we simply announced hikes for sales employed effective May 1.", "We continued making investments in the business, which also had impact on the margins. Our net margins were 21% in dollar terms this quarter compared to 22.9% in Q4. The decline in net margin was due to lower exchange gains on the nonoperating side of the income and the R&D tax credit, which was taken last Q4, and also because the increases in active tax in India from 32.445% to 33.99%.", "Volume growth was at 4.1% quarter-on-quarter, though realizations dropped by about 0.7% during the quarter due to adverse cross currency moves. Though inflations have moved up this quarter, it is still low which gives us some leverage for the future.", "Our replenishments for IT services, including trainees, increased to 70.7% in Q1 as compared to 68.5% last quarter. Excluding trainees, it increased to 74.3% in Q1 as against 71.4% in Q4.", "We have given 8% competition increase with sales folks effective May 1, 8% increase to onsite-offshore staff effective July 1 and 3% onsite workforce also effective July 1, except for people who have already been covered in the last cycle's wage hike. This will put an additional pressure on the margins for Q2 to the extent of roughly about 300 basis points. However, utilization is a lever to offset some of this. Also, there's a 5% depreciation in currency from Q1 realized rate of INR 56.56 to the Q2 assumed rate of INR 59.39, which should provide an upside of 125 basis points on the margins.", "Our cash and cash equivalents, including available-for-sale assets, were at $4.054 billion. Cash realization continues to be strong. Our operating cash flow as a percentage of net profit this quarter was 100%, though the DSOs have marginally gone up to 66 days.", "We saw significant volatility in currency during Q1 with the rupee depreciating by 9.4% against the dollar from end of March to the end of June. Our hedging strategy has resulted in a net positive impact of $3 million. We had outstanding hedges of $1.173 billion as of June end. We saw U.S. dollar appreciate against -- across-the-board on fear of stabling by Fed Reserve and better-than-expected economic data from the U.S. But GBP and euro were fairly stable. Australian dollar was the biggest loser, depreciating 11.4% from March end rate.", "We are maintaining our guidance at 6% to 10%. Our current guidance is restated based on April guidance x currency rates, will be 7% to 11%, since the impact of currency over the last 3 months on FY '14 revenues is roughly about $72 million. Our current guidance is stated based on FY '13 cross currency rates, will be 7.4% to 11.4%, since the impact of currency on FY 2014 revenues is $114 million compared to the rate as -- in FY '13.", "With that, I'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I guess my first question here is we've seen some inconsistent execution over the last, I would say, 2 or 3 quarters. Any sense on whether that inconsistency is starting to level out? And if you could provide any color on why you feel that way, that'd be helpful.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So it is true that our performance has been volatile over the last 2, 3 quarters. We do have a higher level of dependency on discretionary spend. But as you rightly said, it has been volatile over the last 2, 3 quarters. In fact, I would like to say it again, I -- we will not consider one quarter as a secular trend. We are operating with certain number of challenges, which I outlined. And these challenges does create volatility in our performance. This quarter, we have done reasonably well. We will not change our guidance. We are cautiously optimistic about the coming quarters. We -- I would like -- we would like to see a couple or more quarters before we consider this as a secular trend.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the margin front, could you just walk us through the puts and takes on what you could be impacting margins over the next 2 or 3 quarters? I know you talked about wage increases. I know we've got the rupee moving a certain way. I think you've talked about investments in the past. So I'm just trying to get a feel for what the margin outlook is for the business.", "Rajiv Bansal", "If you look at our margins this quarter, we inevitably spoke about certain headwinds in our margins for the quarter. And to some extent, that has been negated by the depreciating rupee. So rupee has helped us to the extent of about 1.2% this quarter. Rupee depreciated on an average by about 4.9%. We had wage impact -- a full quarter wage impact of wages that the -- hike has been given separate of last year -- of this financial -- of last financial year. We had a cross currency impact because last gain that we got from rupee were negated by the cross currency movement. As I was saying, our growth in constant currency basis this quarter is 3.4% as against reported number of 2.7%. We lost roughly about $13.7 million of revenue, primarily with the cross currency movement, which also impacted the margins. We have given promotions in January, which -- and the linked hike for that was given effective April, which has impacted our margins in the end of first quarter. We also had realized rate drop of 0.7% during the quarter, which impacted my margins by roughly about 0.5%. So there have been many factors which have contributed to margin increase or decrease. But I think we have done this reasonably well in terms of keeping our margins at 23.5% for the quarter in spite of the headwinds that we spoke about in April. As we move into the next quarter, we have -- as I mentioned, that we have given wage hike effective July 1 to majority of our people. And that is going to have an impact of roughly about 300 basis points on the margins, but it could get negated by a depreciating rupee. My average rupee rate for the first quarter has been INR 56.56, and the closing rate as of 30th June has been INR 59.39, which is a 5% depreciation of rupee, which should help me on my margin front by roughly about 1.2%, 1.3%. And also, when I see growth, there would also be an uptick in utilization and some of this margin impact that we're talking about, headwinds we're talking about could get negated by the utilization uptick. So I think though we have some elbow room on the margin front, we still have some upsides which we can -- and some positives that we can look at in terms of increasing our margins. But I think the wage hike would impact the margins in the coming quarter. And also if you look at our utilization, it's at 74.3%. We would like our utilization to be more 80%, 81%. So I have clearly about 5.72% or 6.7% or -- elbow room on the utilization. So a large margin would depend on how much is the growth for the year. And if we see sort of big growth for the year, I think a lot of the impact that we're talking about right now, headwinds could be managed in terms of utilization went up and it'd be the depreciation that we're talking about.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just one last quick one for me. On the visa reform stuff, can you share with us any contingency plans that you may have in place, or that you -- I think you mentioned in your commentary that maybe clients are starting to put in place.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the immigration trend, I mean, as you know the details and the Senate has passed the bill, the House bill is actively presented. And finally, they will have to be consent. There is quite a lot of uncertainty around the shape or form in which the bill will finally come through. All we can do at this point is plan for it. Plan for various contingencies. The first and foremost thing from our side is to make sure that our service do not get interrupted to our clients. That definitely requires close cooperation with our clients. We are talking to a lot of clients, especially the major clients. We are discussing with them the various aspects of this bill. We have not seen any impact on the decision making because of the bill at this point in time. Our relationship with our clients are very long term. They understand that this is not a Infosys issue. This is an industry issue and -- which needs to be tackled. Now the contingency plans can include the changing the onsite-offshore ratio, going into a 3-tier approach of delivery. That means very few people on the client site. You can have developments entered in the same time zone or in the same region, along with offshore. We're recruiting more people onsite, which are local nationals applying for green cards or a certain set of people. So there are multiple mitigation ideas and plans which one can formulate, and some of them we are discussing with our clients. We are in the process of hearing out how to execute. But the most important thing is to make sure at this point that we are in close contact with the clients, continue with the discussions on various aspirations of the bill, various aspects of the bill and watch the progress of the bill very closely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes. I want to ask a question about high-level strategy, especially with Chairman Murthy returning to the company. Can you just articulate the latest strategic plan to drive improved earnings and revenue growth at Infosys? And if you could also -- as you speak to the high-level strategy, if you could articulate what the investment and longer-term margin implications of that strategy would be, that would be very helpful.", "S. D. Shibulal", "As you know, Mr. Murthy's focus is always to create superior financial performance. He has done that in the past, and his current focus will also be the same, which has 2 parts to it. One is to create high-quality growth. Second is to have leading margins. So let me add the growth phase first. We have 3 segments of growth, 3 segments of -- 3 offerings in the market, and the #1 thing is to provide higher and higher customer value through these offerings. At the same time, growth is important in these 3 offerings in various dimensions. Let me start with the smallest so that I can answer the rest. If I look at products and platforms space, even if it grows at a very large percentage, it is on a smaller base. That alone -- that is not enough for us to actually reach -- meet our aspirations. Consulting and system integration has grown above average of our company average for the last, I should say, 2 quarters. Business and IT operations has grown below our company average. That is the largest segment which we have. That is 62% of our revenue. And if you don't create growth there, we will not be able to meet our aspirations. Over the last 2, 3 quarters, you have seen the deal wins pick up in that space. Now this quarter again. So -- and the growth in this space comes through large outsourcing deals. We are -- we have made investments, and we will continue to make investments in winning large outsourcing deals. This quarter, we had 7 wins totaling to $600 million of revenue in large outsourcing space. Now the challenge in this space is, #1, this is a space in which differentiation is difficult. So we need to invest in building solutions. We need to invest in automation and productivity improvement, creating efficiencies and use of tools and technology to make sure that we differentiate. #2, it is a price-sensitive space. If you see some of the industry report, a fair part of this space is rebates. That means rebates are deals where clients are rebating at the end of the contract, and they are even more price sensitive. So we have won $600 million of deals, 7 deals this quarter. At the same time -- and in the beginning of the deal, these deals are margin dilutive. Our objective is to make sure that they are margin neutral through the life of the deal. And that is where we need to focus, we need to put in energy, and that is achieved through some of the levers I talked about. So that is the focus on growth. On the margin trend, there are multiple levers which we need to modify. #1 on the large outsourcing deals, we need to drive automation productivity improvements and things like that to make sure that on the lifetime, margin is margin neutral. Second is to look at other costly works like onsite-offshore ratio, reducing nonproductive spend, changing various other levers, varying -- driving various other levers to make sure that we take out costs in the system and drive towards better financial performance in the margin dimension. So these are the areas in which there are discussions and action plans. It is definitely too early because some of them have been here only for the last -- less than 2 months now. And these are the areas where the discussions and action plans are being prompt. But as I said in the beginning, his -- as in the past, his priority is always superior financial performance, which is high-quality growth and leading margins.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. That's extremely helpful. And just -- if I can clarify the financial implications. What I heard there is that you're adding focus to winning large outsourcing deals. And if I heard you correctly, that is probably going to cause margin pressure in the short and medium term. But in the long run, if you can work on things like automation and other efficiencies, you can make those margin neutral. Is that an accurate summary of what I heard on the financial implications?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "All right, wonderful. And then can you just define the timeframe there? Is -- short and medium-term pressure on margins, is that a 1- to 2-year type of a timeframe before you'd have time to drive the efficiencies to make that margin neutral? Or is it a shorter period or a longer period than kind of 1 or 2 years?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So there is one other dimension, which I want to add when I talked about it. It's not only about the large deals where we will create automation and other productivity improvements to create margin neutral -- neutrality over the life of the program. There are other thoughts, optimization measures which have been put in place. I mentioned some of them: that is removing nonproductive spend, whether it is onsite or offshore; driving a performance culture, #2; #3, there are other levers, right. For example, utilization is a lever. It has gone up from 71% to 73%. So if I can drive the utilization up through better planning, better recruitment and better deployment, that's a margin lever. You have onsite-offshore ratio as a lever. It has actually gone up. And I understand that it has gone up because of some of the project starts and things like that. But if I can move it -- we can move it back by, I don't know, maybe 5 points, 7 points over a period of, let's say, next 5, 6 quarters, then that is a margin lever which we can look at. So there are multiple cost-optimization opportunities for us. And Mr. Murthy, as I said, is very focused on performance on growth and on margin.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one other quick clarification. I mean, you went through the puts and takes on margins in the upcoming quarters. Your current operating margin is at 23.5%. Are you roughly expecting your fiscal '14 operating margin to be around 23.5%, given the move in the rupee that has been experienced over the last 3 months? Are you thinking margins will be relatively stable for the full year?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, as I said, we have not given a margin guidance or an EPS guidance for the year. And the reason being, a lot of our margin would be driven by the growth that we see during the year. I had clearly laid out the headwinds and the tailwinds that I see on the margin as we move to the next quarter. And we clearly articulated about the headwinds that we saw at the beginning of the financial year. So as I said in the first quarter, we have been able to maintain our margins as seen as what was in Q4, primarily, because of the rupee depreciation and also the utilization benefit, which helped us -- which gave us the benefit on the margin. But that was negated [ph] by the wage hike, the promotions and the productivity drop that we saw. As we move in the next 2 quarter, we have headwinds in terms of the salary hikes that we are giving effective July 1. As Shibu was saying, in the light of choosing deals, there's more competition, there's more price-sensitive deals, so there would be some pricing pressure unless we see the discretion spend come back. To that extent, I think depreciating rupee helps negating some of the impacts of the headwinds that we're seeing in the margin. And I'm seeing clearly about -- if the rupee is doing at about 59.39 or up, I'm clearly seeing about 1.2%, 1.3% uptick in the margins from there, which will help mitigate some of the margin negatives on the salary hike. So I think I would not like to say where our margins are going to end up in the next 2 or 3 quarters, because a lot of it will depend on what the growth is, how much is the utilization uptick that I can get, and that will help in negating some of the impact of the salary hikes. So we are all trying to increase our growth, trying to see how to get computer [ph] growth that we spoke about. And any growth would help us in increasing our utilization, which should helped us in maintaining our margins.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I'd also like to ask a couple. First, you mentioned that you're subject to discretionary spending. Your consulting package implementation areas actually had some good growth in increase as a percent of total revenue. How were you thinking about that business? And what's driving it, particularly, given that's more of a discretionary item. How are you thinking about that business in terms of the growth for the balance of calendar year '13?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I'm really sorry, the line was not clear. Will you please kindly repeat the question?", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes, no worries. The consulting package and implementation revenue by service offering was strong. Can you talk about what drove that? And how you anticipate the growth of that going forward, particularly, since the consulting side in particular is more subject to discretionary areas? And you highlighted that as a risk, so it did well. Is that going to continue to do well? And if so, why?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So first of all, I think we are well regarded in that space -- definitely well regarded in that space, especially, in certain verticals like retail and manufacturing. #2, some of the revenue growth, which we're seeing this quarter is at Lodestone. The Lodestone integration is now complete. And we are getting much more closer to their plan -- the interim plan to growth. And the synergies of Lodestone is allowing us to win better deals in Europe. You see the environmental challenges do exist in that space, but we have a strong base. We have a strong presence in consulting and system integration in U.S. in 2 or 3 verticals. Retail, for example, we worked with 10 out of the top 10 retailers in U.S. in the digital transformation space. In manufacturing, we work with many of the high-tech manufacturers on their transformation and the after implementation space. We do get deals where it is being -- we do actually get failed deals, the lack of any other term, where we take over deals -- we takeover transformational programs, which are not done well or clients trying to do it for the second time. I think -- let me ask Steve to add to this.", "Stephen R. Pratt", "Yes, thanks, Shibu. Yes, it's interesting. We developed a little bit of a specialty over the last few years of picking up projects that's other consulting firms have failed to do and then doing them successfully. There's some notable examples. And one of the major CPG companies in the world of a major program to help them completely redesign their strategy processes, business and technology for how they did order to cash in their supplier interface. One -- another company in Europe. It's a agribusiness company, very large agribusiness company, where, again, one of the other major consulting firms had done a roughly $100 million failure and took that over and made it very successful. So I think that we really come into our own in consulting and can go head-to-head with anyone. We're especially proud of the fact that we think we pioneered the use of global delivery as upside [ph] to management consulting and the implementation of all those recommendations, starting in the 2002, 2003, 2004 era. And I think that right now, we're working very hard to break down the barrier between strategy, consulting and implementation. And so on every one of our programs, we link every business activity to the creation of business value, either through free cash flow or the increasing shareholder value. And so it's working in the market. I think the clients are seeing the value that we're delivering to them. We're cost competitive. We have great people. And that's why you're seeing us, I think, outperform some of our competitors at both the top line and the bottom line.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "All right, fair enough. And the second question I wanted to ask is about headcount growth objectives. What are your targets? And, specifically, you mentioned utilization. How do you balance your growth objectives on headcount? And I think you said target -- increasing utilization. If you could just talk about where you think -- how you think your headcount's going to increase. And then what do you anticipate, or what would you like to achieve, say, by year end, in terms of utilization rates?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So our utilization has moved up from 71% to 74% quarter-on-quarter. We have added 10,000 people during the quarter. At the same time, the net addition has been 565. Out of the total 10,000 which we added, 5,000 people -- 5,000-plus, I'm giving approximate numbers. 5,000 people joined Infosys Limited. Now our aspiration of utilization is somewhere between 78% to 82% -- that will be somewhere between 78% to 82%. That will be our optimum utilization. So we do have some way to go to get there. Meanwhile, there are about 5,000 offers, which we have given for people to join this year. This was done last year. If we play 80% conversion rate, somewhere between 3,500 to 4,000 people will join during the year. Finally, utilization is a reflection of growth, right? Divided the utilization growth quarter-on-quarter, because our volume went up by 4.1%. So it is definitely a reflection of growth. And growth -- there are 3 aspects to utilization: growth, intake and attrition. So with better planning and better growth, we are hoping that utilization will get closer to our aspiration range of 78% to 82%.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to go back to business operations for a second. And I know the last few quarters we talked about pricing pressure there. And you kind of looked at your aggregate realization and it was, overall, kind of flattish. And I suspect that was largely mixed with CSI increase as part of the mix with the benefit from Lodestone, so I just wanted to clarify that. But really wanted to get -- to drill down and sort of get a better understanding for what you're seeing in like-for-like pricing within business operations. And is it any better or worse than it's been the last 3 quarters?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the business operations space is definitely difficult to differentiate and more commoditized than other areas. Even in business IT -- business and IT operations, there are certain areas, even more difficult. So I would -- certainly the business operations space is more difficult. The large outsourcing deals, especially, in the rebid ones are price sensitive. They are margin dilutive in the beginning. It will also require us to invest in one way or other. So for example, if you look at the Harley-Davidson deal, we build developments in Milwaukee for that deal, so things like that. Our aspiration is to make the margin neutral during the life of the program through all the interventions I talked about. At the end of the day, one needs to look at these things as a portfolio. That means the consulting and system integration, business and IT operations, products, platforms, cloud and mobility, engineering, all of this as a portfolio. And our objective is to see -- make sure that we can meet our aspirations by managing it as a portfolio. I don't want to comment on what percentage difference we see. And that is the -- it's a very deal-specific decision to make. It depends upon the size of the deal, the longevity of the deal, whether it's a strategic customer whom we are trying to defend, all of these factors go into the deal pricing.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then another question, different direction, but the public services area. So a couple of quarters in a row, a very nice sequential strength. Maybe you could comment on what's kind of driving that? And has it been a few large deals? And is this sort of a sustainable sort of going forward trend from here?", "Ashok Vemuri", "Yes, this is Ashok. The basic growth in our health care business has been on the back of the large District of Columbia health exchange program. After that win, based on that performance, we've had a couple of other wins in the health care sector. So we think that in the short to medium term, this is fairly sustainable, the growth that we have seen in that. But, of course, the fact that many of the states are unable to meet the time line to build their exchanges and, therefore, require to pass themselves onto the federal exchange will diminish some of the volumes that we anticipated as we hit the end of the year. But, overall, with one of the larger deals that we have won that Shibu was alluding to earlier, and being in the health care space, that has also given us some traction, which we will build on through the course of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So, while I understand your commentary about the scale of the core outsourcing business and the need to recapture, share and grow it, this segment by your own admission is commoditizing. So that said, perhaps you could help us better understand, what your longer-term objective is in investing in this segment, given that once the utilization dynamic plays out and the business becomes more difficult to grow profitably, particularly, if the currency trend reverses. So, perhaps, again, you could help us understand again what the longer-term objective is, as you kind of re-up, if you will, in this segment of the market?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we have -- when you look at our offerings to our clients, there are 3 major offerings, right? Consulting, system integration, business and IT operations and products and platforms. We have to get growth in all of them to achieve our aspiration. I don't believe that we can grow one segment to counter or to balance the lack of growth in another segment. I don't believe it is possible. Products and platform, even if it is growing fast, let's say, even if grows 30%, it did not go into -- make the necessary move. Business and IT operations is about 62% of our revenue. All that is not commoditized -- there are certain areas like, for example, application management is getting commoditized. To create aspirational growth, and we need to grow all the 3 segments. Now in consulting and systems integration, that growth will be at higher revenue productivity, bigger on-site and probably better margins. And in business and IT operations, what we need to do is to drive efficiency, productivity, higher utilization, right scaling, automation and other things to make sure that our margin aspirations are met. At the end of the day, margin is a reflection of the price and the operational efficiency we bring to the table. So in this space, where pricing is more -- there are pricing challenges, we have to drive more operational efficiency to make sure that we meet our margin aspirations. So that is what we are trying to do in that space. Even long term, I'm very clear that all of these 3 segments have to grow. Product and platform will grow at a higher percentage, and it will eventually catch up to a more balanced portfolio. But until that happens, I think, all the 3 segments have to grow and we have to come up with strategies to drive operational efficiency in the business and IT operations space, which will give us -- which will allow us to realize our margin aspirations.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So just to clarify a little bit. As you probably know, Shibu, the traditional asset-based outsourcing business went through that cycle as well, and it became very difficult over a period of time to not only realize those efficiencies but also to pass them through or realize those yourself without passing through those savings to the customers. So perhaps you could elaborate on why you think this segment will be different and play out differently than it did in the asset-based game? And then secondly, when you look at those growth initiatives in your current base of business, how much of that is with existing outsourcing clients versus perhaps just new logo sort of just buying those newer services?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So as you can see, we have -- in over the last 10 years -- so in over the last 10 years, we have invested heavily into building a very strong consulting and system integration capability. And I would tend to believe that while we have established, we have a long way to go and a long run rate for us to execute on that strategy. If you look at our consulting and system integration revenue, which is 54% of our revenue today, the industry average is probably 18% to 20%. Probably 18%, that's the number I remember, which means we are way ahead of the industry in creating an offering which will, in a sense, counterbalance some of the challenges which we have in there which were in IT operations. That we have done over the last 10 years. In the last 18 months, we have started on our journey of products and platform. We have $730 million of booked business in products in the platform space, 46 clients on-boarded, 79 clients, including products, not including Finacle. It is that business in the investment phase. Over the coming years, as we execute on our strategic direction, that percentage of revenue will go up. So as we have articulated in the past, eventually, these 3 offerings will balance out, one providing higher revenue productivity, one providing higher -- and also, when you look at business and IT operations, today, our on-site offshore ratio for business and IT operations is very similar to consulting and system integration. While I see the consulting and system integration probably going up a bit, we can look at business and IT operations coming down. Platform and product businesses, predominantly, offshore business. So the whole strategy is about creating a portfolio, which will provide -- which has various differentiated characteristics, and which will allow us to meet our aspiration as a portfolio. So if I look at it 5 to 7 years out, because these kinds of changes do not happen overnight, our aspiration is to make sure that our portfolio balances itself out, and it will allow us to realize our aspirational margin. Now by then you'll have another set of challenges and we have to come out with another set of strategies. But from here to there, this is what I see.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jesse Hulsing from Pacific Crest.", "Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Shibu, to come back to your commentary around larger deals and the pricing trends within that segment of your business, do you see any signs that the decline in pricing that's been occurring over the last few years will ever stabilize? And what would be the driver of that if so?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think the pricing, apart from any strategy-specific characteristics, also it's like the demand-supply environment. So the demand we accept and the pricing power comes back in all service lines, some service lines better than other, that's #1. I don't see any secular trend in the reversal of that trend. At the same time, I'm also seeing that we're able -- we are able to bring in innovation. So for example, if you look at our alliance with IPsoft, which is a very innovative thing to do. That allows you to actually differentiate in the market and get better pricing power. So even in commoditized services, you have an opportunity to be innovative and get pricing power. Even -- in some of our solutions, which are multi-tower solutions, where we combine infrastructure and application management or where we do a random transform kind of a program in the interest of the space. Because of the uniqueness of the solution, we are able to get -- we always get a pricing premium, but we are unable to get a better pricing premium. So even in commoditized services, if you can bring in innovation, if you can bring in unique solutions, you are able to demand pricing premium. So when I look at the future, 2 aspects: One is demand supply balance; second is innovation, which will allow you to create pricing power. I'm going to ask B.G. to add to this.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Thanks, Shibu. To give a specific example, one of our large investment banks' particular opportunity was about research and publishing reports. And this opportunity came by while clients were looking at consolidation of the services. There are 3 other vendors doing it. And they had their own captive [ph]doing, carrying out these services. Then we were allowed to bid for the 3, not only came out with the response of how Infosys has the capability to carry out this kind of research and publish. But more importantly, the position of platform which is subject, which actually differentiates the way, not only referred to as carry out but published in real time. And none of the other vendors had anything close to what we called demonstrate in terms of differentiation, because we were able to position our platform to service this operational need. So this involve particularly IT and BPO, so this offering, which is typically commoditized. And when we were able to showcase our platform in lieu of just offering a pure-play service dimension, there was simply no competition. And this is how we will be able to drive differentiation if we are able to bring in our IP to bear on even traditional outsourcing services.", "Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "That's great color, B.G. And to follow-up kind of on the -- along the same lines, the rupee depreciating is great for supporting near-term margins, but it also creates the risk that dollar pricing can come down, because your offshore labor costs are going down. Have you had any conversations like that with customers, where they see the rupee at 60 to the dollar, and are wondering where their rate negotiation is? And have you seen any competitors start to use that, I guess, freedom or wiggle room that rupee depreciation creates as a means to get more aggressive with pricing, particularly, on these larger deals?", "Ashok Vemuri", "This is Ashok. Typically, we have not found any of our customers wanting to engage with us in situations where there is any change in the currency. I mean, they spend in the currency -- the local currency and we build them in the local currency. And it's a fairly slippery slope, if you start negotiating, if the client starts negotiating every contract based on where the FX rate is, because they could lose some and they could win some. We have not been invited to any conversation of this sort. I don't think they necessarily pay attention to a depreciating rupee and ask us to come back to the table to renegotiate a contract.", "Jesse Hulsing - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And I guess as kind of a final -- looking at this from a bigger picture perspective. Shibu, I know your strategy is to land larger deals and increase the available volume, I guess, to your company and then drive efficiency through scale over the long run. This isn't a new strategy within the industry. Your competitors have been doing this for a while. I guess, looking at where pricing is trending, do you think there's a limitation to how much efficiency you can squeeze out of these larger deals? And I mean, if I look at the industry, you have been a $1 billion company for almost a decade now. How much more innovation on your delivery is there left to drive the type of efficiency necessary to make these contracts profitable in the long run?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So please remember that is not totally strategy, right? So we have different strategies and in different parts of our business in the outsourcing space, and when it comes to large outsourcing deals, I agree with you, that's the strategy. And so in consulting and systems integration, in products and platforms, in cloud, in mobility, in Big Data, in appliance technologies, that is not the strategy, right? So strategy which you're talking about is -- and this strategy does not apply to all the deals in that space. It applies to a certain number of deals in the large outsourcing space, where either we want to win it, or it is strategic to us, or it's in strategic client. That's #1. #2, there is a limit to what you can do. There is no doubt. But as time goes by, there are no limits being found. So for example, in interest of the management, with the IPsoft lines, we are able to take that to a new level, right? In some of the large outsourcing deals, by applying 1 of the platforms that B.G. talked about, this could not have been done -- actually, we could not have done it 2 years back. So there are new levels of innovation, which we can bring. But I agree with you that there is a limit to which you can go. But the important point is to know that it is only a part of our business, where we are trying out that strategy.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I would now like to hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for being a part of this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this conference call.

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Linda. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Infosys Q2 FY '14 Earnings Call. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in New York. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal; along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, which will be followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2014. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the accompany faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. I will give -- I will begin by giving an overview of Q2. Our growth was 3.8% in reported currency term and 4.2% on constant currency terms. Our volume grew by 3.1% quarter-on-quarter and the realization -- the revenue realization increased by 0.6% in reported currency terms and 0.9% in constant currency terms. We had broad-based growth in all verticals, geos and horizontals, growing vigorously on a constant currency basis. We have added 7 -- 68 new clients, 37 net. We have added 12,000 growth employees during this quarter. Our total employee count is 160,227 as of the end of Q2. Our operating margin for the quarter was 21.9%.", "Let me also give you some color on business trends in various areas. In financial services, we have seen some improvement in the last 3 months both in the U.S. and in Europe. This improvement is driven by increased spending in new products and channels. Interest in areas like cloud is higher today than a year back. While compliance-related spending continues, there is positive momentum towards managed services, social media and business-facing products and platforms. However, the overall discretionary spend continues to be muted with a flat to negative outlook.", "In retail and CPG, there is vendor consolidation and application management and infrastructure management deals emerging as a way of demonstrating cost savings. This is the market we continue to see strong investment. Strong focus on reducing nondiscretionary spend is creating increased pipeline of legacy contracts though they are price sensitive. We see more decisions being taken than last year in the areas of business intelligence and digital consumer. Life sciences continues to see challenges due to reduced product differentiation and other cost pressures. The industry is focused on cloud-based services as a way to reduce operation -- operating cost.", "In manufacturing, the business momentum in high tech remains positive through client spend in relatively stagnant -- even though client spend is relatively stagnant due to sluggish PC markets and slower growth in Europe and emerging economies. However, we see spending in auto and aero industries driven by increased spending in technology in new areas like digital, connected vehicle, analytics and global expansion. The primary growth driver for manufacturing continues to be Americas, with Europe expected to see some challenges as some large transformation programs are nearing completion.", "We don't see any let up in challenges in energy, utilities and communication services space. The renewed challenges for clients is triggering consolidation in the industry and forcing clients to look at adjacent markets. Discretionary spend is being limited to key projects driven by the business. Our focus on proactively creating large deals has led to a significantly better pipeline. We are also focused on increasing our business in the wireless and cable space as a way to mitigate the risks in the wire line space. Competitive intensity is high in this vertical and decision cycles are long.", "Now moving on to service lines, business and IT operation space. Most deals are focused on vendor consolidation, end-to-end application management and application modernization. Emergence of converging client and [ph] cloud is driving asset consolidation and cost optimization by making clients asset light, with automation being a focus area. Further investment in IT are moving towards mobile devices, Big Data, social and cloud services. Pricing continues to be a challenge in large outsourcing deals. As regarding discretionary spend, which drives our consulting and system integration business, we see a tough business environment, with investments being evaluated against stringent financial criteria. Spend trends remained flat to down in various verticals. Though pipeline this year is stronger than last year, decision cycles remain elevated. Large transformation programs are broken into smaller chunks, clientele-embracing applications, which create business value while phasing out those which are not adding value.", "During the quarter, we had 5 large deal wins adding up to $450 million, 3 deals were in FSI, 1 each in retail and manufacturing, and 2 deals were in America, 2 in Europe and 1 in Rest of the World. Most of the large-deal pipeline is driven by clients looking at restructuring existing spend with a bias towards ADM and infrastructure management.", "Across industry verticals, more clients from Continental Europe are opening to outsourcing, with offshore players -- with the offshore players and 50% of the pipeline -- all verticals into the pipeline is from Europe. The pipeline across multiple verticals is robust.", "We have deployed a portfolio of significant investment in products and platforms, which are yielding good results. This quarter, we have 15 new clients added to our products and platforms service space. We have won 50% more TCV in this quarter than last quarter. This is also a result of adoption of SAP services by our clients.", "During the quarter, we have made 3 key changes in our organizational structure. We have refocused on growth markets by combining 4 countries: Australia, China, Japan, Middle East and Southeast Asia. They will operate as an independent P&L and the -- then the countries will be headed by respective country heads. Overall responsibility will be with Pete [ph], who will report to the CEO. We have created a new industry vertical business unit with integrated sales and delivery, and we will focus on utilities and resources. This will be headed by Stephen Pratt. We have also carved out life sciences and insurance and created separate P&Ls. Both BITS and CSA will report into [indiscernible] going forward. There is no change in our strategic direction and our focus on 3 offerings, CSI, BITS and PPS. The changes which we have made during this quarter is to sharpen our focus on growth markets, improve productivity and utilization and increase client -- to increase client velocity.", "Now let me talk about the guidance. Our guidance was 6% to 10% in the beginning of the year. End of first quarter, we had restated 6% to 10%, which meant, in constant currency terms, 7.7% to 10.7%. We have revised our -- we have changed our guidance to 9.10% (sic) [ 9% to 10% ] at the end of Q2. In constant currency terms, this will be a guidance of 9.9% to 10.9%. Yes, we have seen positive momentum, but we are entering Q3 and Q4, which are historically soft quarters for Infosys. More importantly, we have made a number of internal changes. We have made -- we are focused on cost optimization. We are focused on large outsourcing deals. We are focused on creating -- we're focused on growth markets. While these changes are in flight, it takes time to yield results. The large deals which we won this quarter will only yield results a couple of quarters later. Because of all these factors, we remain cautious, and our guidance is 9% to 10% in reported currency terms.", "Thank you.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Good morning, everyone. Just to give you, on the financial performance, our revenues for the current quarter grew sequentially by 15.1% in rupee terms and 3.8% in dollar terms. On a constant currency basis, this is 4.2% growth sequentially in dollar terms. EPS for the quarter is at INR 42.12. This includes a provision of INR 219 crores for visa-related matters. Without this, the EPS would have been INR 45.96. Excluding the provision for visa-related matter, the margins for the quarter is at 23.6%, which is same as that of last quarter. This quarter, we saw significant volatility in currency, with the rupee depreciating by 16% intra-quarter and on an average by 11%. We have outstanding hedges of 1.1 billion as of September end.", "We had given update -- or said in our July earnings call. We have given 8% commission hike to our sales folks effective 1st of May, 8% increase to our offshore folks effective 1st July and 3% to our on-site folks. This had impacted our margins by 300 basis point as well, as articulated in the July earnings call. The benefit of rupee depreciation of 11% that we saw during the quarter has been offset by the July -- by the salary hikes that I just spoke about.", "Our net margin is at 18.6%, 2.5% lower than the previous quarter primarily because of the provision that we took for the visa-related matter, without which the margin would have been 20.3% as against 21.1% last quarter. The reduction is due to exchange loss on the account of significant volatility that we saw in the currencies. The volume growth is at 3.1% on a sequential basis, and the realization increased by 0.6% during the quarter. Available utilization, including trainees, increased to 73.1% as compared to 70.7% last quarter. Excluding trainees, it increased to 77.5% as against 74.3% last quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents, including available-for-sale asset, is at INR 26,907 crores as against INR 24,078 crores in the previous quarter. We have done exceedingly well in terms of our receivable collections. Our DSO is at 62 days as against 66 days in the previous quarter. We have revised our rupee guidance to 21% to 22% for FY 2014. We have converted our dollar guidance of 9% to 10% into rupee guidance at an exchange rate of INR 62.61 for the next 2 quarters.", "With this, I'll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Anantha Narayan of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Anantha Narayan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I had a couple of questions. The first one, Rajiv, was on near- and medium-term margins. I know some of your peers do give us an indication of an aspirational range that they are comfortable with. For example, one of them has a range of 26% to 27%. Another one has 19% to 20%. Now what would be that equivalent range for you? And secondly, from a utilization perspective, your utilization numbers, excluding your trainees, has gone up almost 6 percentage points in the last couple of quarters, and it's currently at around 78%. Where do think that could potentially go up to?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Okay. On the margin, as I was -- as I said in my interaction with the analysts and investors, I think this year, if you look at it, the last few quarters of our performance has been kind of volatile. We have had a couple of good quarters and then a bad quarter. And this year, as Samuti [ph] had articulated, we initiated these 4 initiatives in terms of sales effectiveness, cost optimization, qualities and improving quality and productivity, and I think a lot of investment needs to be made in this initiative. What we are trying to do here is try to create an engine which will deliver high-quality revenue growth, industry-leading quality -- industry-leading growth at much superior margins. And I think a lot of investments, which are being made today, are to ensure that we have a brighter future and a better growth and better margins in the future. So I think I'm not too worried about, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, how the margins are moving right now. I think we are doing all the right things. We are making the right investments. We are -- attrition is one of the concerns that we have. We're investing back in the employees. We have given the wage hike. We have changed the salary structures for the employees. We are paying them better variable pay. We're investing in sales, investing in tools, investing in product quality and productivity, investing in products. So I think this year, we have to make all the right investments to ensure that our exit rate this year actually is on a good deal pipeline, healthy business momentum, which will deliver a high growth and a high margin. So I think I would say -- in the medium to long term, I would say that we would have better margins in the industry than the competition. But in the short term, I think you will see volatility depending on how our growth is delivering. On the utilization front, I think our utilization has increased to 77.5%, which is good. If you look at our net addition the last couple of quarters, it has been minimal. But I think we still have a lot of headroom there. I would expect our utilization to be about 82% on a steady state basis because I think that is something which many companies have shown that they can sustain, and I believe that we have about 4.5% headroom on the utilization front excluding trainees.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Last quarter, can you -- looking at EBIT margins, can you talk about the pluses and minuses, the different factors that impacted and benefited margins during the quarter? The only factor -- the only thing that you kind of mentioned was comp expenses. And can you talk about some of the things, like FX, et cetera?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Sure. So if you look at -- as I said, the margins have remained flat at 23.5% operating margin. We saw rupee volatility of 11%, rupee depreciation of 11%, which have given us an uptick in the margin, about 2.5%. We had wage hike, which impacted our margin downward by about 3%. We saw revenue productivity going up by 0.6%. We saw utilization improvement of 2.4% and the on-site mix of 0.8%, which, to some extent, have been offset by cost currency impact and also by paying better our employees in terms of variable pay and bonuses. So a lot of investment and a lot of upside that you have seen on the rupee depreciation has gone into wage hike, upside that you're seeing on the improving of the official parameters had gone back -- has pulled back into business in terms of investment in sales, in terms of investment, in terms of paying employees better.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up. I think you mentioned in the past that you've got to look at Q4, Q4's booking numbers and kind of the revenue number as a starting point in terms of looking at fiscal year 2015. Is that still kind of the plan at this point? And based on what you're seeing, things are kind of falling in. Where they should be falling at this point?", "Rajiv Bansal", "See, we are looking towards that. We -- as I said, we have made the right investments. We are doing all the right things, but some of these things will take time. There is not a magic wand which we'll just turn around and we'll see superior performance overnight. But I think the last 2 quarters' performances gives us a lot of encouragement. I think we ought to continue doing the right things, make the right investment. And I think definitely, the exit rate of this year would definitely be something that we would look at because that sets the flow for the next year. So I think we are very focused on improving and continuing this journey -- or the improvement that we are seeing in the last 2 quarters, and we're very focused on continuing on the journey.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nitin Padmanabhan of Espirito Santo.", "Nitin Padmanabhan - Espirito Santo Investment Bank, Research Division", "So what is it that worries you in the medium term in terms of growth because if I look at your guidance, it looks pretty weak because the first half itself has a 14% growth. Like last year, where you did highlight that there were specific client situations, are you seeing anything of those that worry you at this point? Or is it project closures, ramp-downs? And what is that -- what do you do in terms of lack of near-term ramp-up? I just wanted some color.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So there are 2 factors. Number one, there is some seasonality to our business. Q3 and Q4 are generally soft quarters for us if you look at it historically. And we also have less number of working days in Q3. So those do have impact, but more importantly, we are also going through some internal changes. And as Rajiv said, we are actually trying to put the foundation down for a sustainable growth over a long period of time at superior margins. They do make and they do require investments, but more importantly, they require changes. And those changes will yield results only in the long term. They are not going to yield results overnight. And these 2 factors are the drivers of caution, and we remain cautious. We have looked at our current visibility. We have looked at our current deal pipeline. We have looked at our current client behavior. We have looked at how the different industry verticals are behaving and faced with challenges. So for example, the U.S. shutdown will have some impact on the defense industry, which will flow into the manufacturing industry sooner or later. It is too early. And in the retail segment, we have seen -- these are industry phenomena, but we also do get impacted by them. We have seen concerns about holiday spend and other things. So there are external -- but more importantly, internal changes which we have made, which we believe will only yield results in the long term. These factors are considered into our guidance, and that's why we have kept our guidance at 9% to 10%, 9% to 10% in reported currency, 9.9% to 10.9% in constant currency.", "Nitin Padmanabhan - Espirito Santo Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sure. I was just trying to understand because historically, at least a year ago, you had highlighted specific -- client-specific issues that you had at some point. There is nothing of that sort that you would worry about in terms of criticality at this point?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There are no specific client issues I'm worried about. There are -- I talked about the internal changes which we are making, which will yield results only in the long term, and I talked about industry, the later [ph] aspects, and more importantly, the -- equally importantly, the seasonality of our business.", "Nitin Padmanabhan - Espirito Santo Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sure. And just one last question, if I may. You highlighted that attrition was a worry for you. I just want to understand, in terms of attrition, how much of that would have been involuntary this quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So attrition is a matter of concern for us even though, in absolute numbers, attrition has come down. In absolute numbers, attrition has come down, but in personnel terms, it has not really come down materially. We have done a number of things. We have given compensation increase. We have given promotions. We have given -- we have reviewed the variability of compensation. We have provision for higher variable compensation in the system. We have done a number of things. And communication also has been a very important part of this process. We have -- we're in constant touch with our employees. We will continue to do it. Now the involuntary attrition, the difference between voluntary and involuntary attrition will be about 1.5%. So the involuntary attrition will be 1.5%.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nitin Mohta of Macquarie.", "Nitin Mohta - Macquarie Research", "Shibu, I just wanted to understand the demand environment a little better. Is it that you're seeing a pickup across the board? Or is it more a function of your market share and deal win ratios improving?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There is improvement in the demand environment in U.S. Europe is starting to show some signs of demand improvement. It do vary, industry vertical to vertical. We have seen demand improvement in financial services, which is a very large portion of our business. Traditionally, we will spend on cost management and regulatory and compliance areas. We are seeing some early signs spending in new products and new channels. So that's good for us. We are also starting to spend on digital transformation. That also helps us. In retail, continuing to see pickup in the digital space, but more importantly, retailers are looking for optimization of their operations, which is leading to either vendor consolidation or large outsourcing opportunities, which we have not traditionally seen in retail. Manufacturing, high tech, is showing positive momentum. And in the areas that where we're not seeing any change in the momentum is -- or even -- I wouldn't say degradation, but lack of momentum, would be in wire line. We are quite focused on increasing our business in wireless and cable to mitigate this lack of momentum in the wire line, which is then a substantial portion of our energy, utilities and communication services space. So overall, we are seeing some improvement in momentum more in the U.S. and less in Europe. Europe is starting to show early signs. The momentum is different in different verticals. Now at the same time, there are, of course, some concerns in the environment. See, the environment continues to be volatile. So while this has all happened, the government shutdown happened, then you had -- you have this overhang of the debt ceiling. So there are -- there is volatility in this situation, but if I look at generally, there is positive momentum.", "Nitin Mohta - Macquarie Research", "Shibu, if you can just give some color on how you're seeing your market shares changing probably now versus a year ago, any comment on vendor issue.", "Rajiv Bansal", "So I will look at it in 3 different dimensions. So if you look at the large opportunity, large outsourcing deals, remember these are price-sensitive deals. These are -- and the competition is quite heavy. If you look at our track record, it has improved. If you look at the second half of last year, we won about $1 billion in large outsourcing deals and those deals have now converted to revenue, and that is what is showing up in Q1 and Q2 as revenues. If you look at last -- this half, that is the first half of this year, so far, I think we improved similar number of deals and similar value. More importantly, we are focused on new revenue rather than rebate. So I believe that they will start showing up in revenue a couple of quarters later. So our ability to win large outsourcing deals have improved. And some of them, we have won even against some of our traditional competition and sometimes -- in majority of times, we have succeeded in vendor consolidation environment. That is on large outsourcing deals. On the transformation space, our capabilities have gone up. Especially with the Lodestone acquisition, now our capabilities have gone up in the U.S. -- Europe. The integration has to complete and the people have to come together to win deals and see in [ph] pipeline, which is being attacked by joint Infosys-Lodestone team. I expect that will yield results as time goes by. The third offering that we have in products and platform is very, very small. It cannot make a difference to Infosys' growth. It is in its early stages, other than Finacle, but this quarter, we have added 15 new clients. And the TCV win this quarter was much higher than last quarter. So our ability to create solutions, which are allowed [ph] into our clients, our ability to show business value, our ability to win has improved. We still have a long way to go. Remember that. That is where all the internal changes we are making are important. We are doing cost optimization. We are driving productivity and quality. We are improving -- we are trying to improve the quality of our sales force. We are looking at mitigating immigration-related issues. So these initiatives have just started. They have started about 3 months back and way too early for us to say that the results will be there immediately. So that is why it will take time for these things to yield results, and that is why we remain cautious.", "Nitin Mohta - Macquarie Research", "Sir, if I could just tie in the last a bit. So if I look at the second half of fiscal '14 and compare it with a $1 billion kind of contractments that you had last year and similar level in the first half, you feel more optimistic about the deal pipeline in the second half or it's going to be roughly the same level?", "S. D. Shibulal", "The pipeline is somewhat similar actually. I am entering -- I think, if I look at the current pipeline, which is about a year back, pipeline is somewhat similar. But if I look at the velocity of wins, velocity of wins in Q3 and Q4 will be lower than Q1 and Q2 because of the 2 simple reasons. Number one is that people have been on holiday, and that does impact the velocity of the -- I'm not talking about general velocity, I'm talking about large outsourcing deal velocity. We did see, last year, a little bit in Q4. So the pipeline is similar.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Diviya Nagarajan of UBS.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions. This one-time provision that we've had this quarter, can we assume that, that won't trigger for the rest of the year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So this is in relation to our discussion with the U.S. Attorney's Office and other government departments, regarding a civil resolution of the government investigation into our compliance of I-9 requirements and past B1 usage. Based on the status of these discussions, we have set aside a reserve of $35 million. Now because the discussions are ongoing, we are not able to provide additional details at this point in time.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got that. In terms of your segmental breakup, some of your sectors like telecom, telecom seems to have recovered this quarter after a couple of quarters of decline. Are you willing to call this a secular trend for the rest of the year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me ask Prasad to respond to that.", "Prasad Thrikutam", "This is Prasad. I think the -- as Shibu mentioned in his opening remarks, the pressure on wireline business continues. We are trying to offset the mix of our business by moving more and more work, on a relative basis, to the cable and the wireless business. But on the wireline side, we will see -- we will continue to see challenges. And at an overall level, that will drag the telecom growth overall downwards, although cable and media are still going fairly strong for us.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just one last question on your volumes. Firstly, the volumes for the second quarter, which is typically strong, seem to be little on the lighter side. And in particular, on-site volumes seem to have declined. Is this a function of projects having started last quarter and this is a normalization effect or do you think that this is an indication of what should we expect for the next couple of quarters?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the volume grew by 3.1% in Q2, on-site is 0.7% and offshore is 4.3%. Actually, if you look at the last couple of quarters, you can see the on-site growth was higher. And in a way, the on-site growth signals new project starts, which will eventually lead to offshore growth. But more importantly, this is also an internal change which we are making. We are very focused on making sure that we do more and more work from offshore. That is one way for us to provide higher and higher value to our clients. So one of the internal changes we are making is to drive more and more work from offshore. Again, I want to say that these changes, while you have seen some improvement, I -- it's too early to say that they are going to make overnight differences. We expect that to yield results in the long term. This is also a way for us to address a potential immigration bill if it becomes a reality.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pankaj Kapoor of Standard Chartered Securities.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Shibu, just want to check on the next couple of quarters when we are guiding for almost a sequential decline of about 1%. Is that largely because of the internal changes that you are referring to. So basically, the on-site to offshore shift, which is having this decline in the top line?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have seen growth over the last 4, 5 quarters but, at the same time, we have seen this volatility. That's one factor. Second factor is that historically, if you look at our performance, there is seasonality to some of the quarters and Q3 and Q4 are generally soft. Then number 3 is more important, that we are making a bunch of internal changes, which is meant to create an environment of sustainable growth and sustainable profit. And those changes will take time to yield results. These are not silver bullets, it will take time to yield results. And finally, our guidance is always a statement of fact. We have looked at our pipeline. We have looked at our clients. We have looked at our other revenue mix. We have looked to our -- the number of working days in Q3. We have looked at all of those things. And we felt that we need to remain cautious because the internal changes will take time to yield results and there are external -- as I said, the seasonality to our business. So we have given a guidance of 9% to 10%. In constant currency terms, it is 9.9% to 10.9%. Given all the facts we know at this point in time, we believe this is the right guidance.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Okay, sir. And just, Rajiv, on the margin front, can you quantify what was the benefit that you got from currency in this quarter?", "Rajiv Bansal", "This quarter, on an average basis, currency depreciated by 11%, which give a benefit of 250 basis points on the currency, which is offset by a 300-basis-point impact because of wage hike.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Okay. So is it like fair to assume that outside of the currency, the margins would have bottomed out at year end from year on. Obviously, FX currency, we should see margins of rupee on a up-trending trajectory or you think there are further changes ahead on the margin side?", "Rajiv Bansal", "So, there are a couple of factors which will impact the margin. One of is the benefit growth, because I think we need to have a minimum growth to sustain the margin because -- well, most of the expenses in the current quarter would be fixed, because, as you know, most of our expenses are salary cost. Having said that, I think on the margin front, we have a couple of levers in terms of utilization on set up issue. All the initiatives that we took on the cost optimization in the last quarter will start yielding results on this quarter. So I think we have some upside in the margin but I think the important part, which I was saying in the earlier -- also was that, we have to make the investment to ensure that we exit this year with a good growth momentum, with a good margin, so that the next year looks better. I think we are on that path. We are making the right investments. And I think, if we continue on that path, I think we would see the margins -- these margins will have bottomed out. But I think a lot in the near future will depend on the growth that we did.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "So is it like fair to assume that you will be reinvesting only the currency gains into the business side? Or does it mean that irrespective of the currency, you will continue to invest, which means that the margins can fall further from here?", "Rajiv Bansal", "If the investments are going to give us long-term returns, which are for the better of the organization, then I think we would make the investments with respect to currency movements. I think currency movements happen. We took the decision to give a wage hike without knowing that the currency would move the way it had moved. So I think we are making the investments, which are the right investments, which have -- which we know will give us return in the future, and I think the currency depreciation just happened within the quarter, which we couldn't predict at the beginning of the quarter. So I think we are making the investment with respect to the currency movements.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sanjay Parekh of Reliance Mutual Fund.", "Sanjay Parekh - Reliance Capital Asset Management Limited", "Mr. Murthy had mentioned that one of the agenda would reduction in on-site cost, and the on-site cost was -- had steeply gone up from 36% to 46%. And you did allude in your call that we are on towards the reduction. But if you can give us some flavor of over what period do we see this cost coming down? And particularly within that, also, could we control the -- expat utilization, which is lower than the overall on-site. On that piece also, do we see some cost? So if you can give some flavor over the next 3, 4 quarters that will help.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Sure. Yes, Mr. Murthy has said that, and there is a lot of work happening on reducing on-site cost. It can be done by multiple levers. Number one is reduction in on-site percentage itself. And number two is rationalizing costs, changing role ratios. And all of these are long term. We can't go in and say we are going to reduce the on-site by 5% with clients starting tomorrow morning, because the client also has to be prepared. Changing the role ratios is a gradual process. Utilization on-site is quite substantially high. We are at about 94% also utilization. Now our deputy utilization is even higher. We will continue to push, but the point is that none of this is overnight and it will take time. We have seen improvement this quarter, on-site, offshore ratio. It has improved by 0.8%, but it will take time. And it will take few quarters and we will continue to focus and -- but results will show up over a period of time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rahul Bhangare of William Blair.", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Manufacturing had a quite a good quarter. Can you help reconcile some of the actual performance with some of your cautious commentary from last quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have given a guidance. If you remember last quarter, we have stepped our guidance of 6% to 10%, which is approximately 7.7% to 10.7% for the year. The quarter-on-quarter is not the important issue. One needs to look at secular trends. We have seen growth for the last 4, 5 quarters sequentially. But there are assets -- there are multiple internal transformations we are doing to create the sustainable growth and sustainable margins. And they do take time to yield results. The environment has also been volatile. We have seen positiveness in the U.S. and some positiveness is starting to happen in Europe, but it continues to be volatile. And there are some unforeseen events, which also happened in the environment. So our statements are actually statements of fact as we see it. When we enter the quarter, our visibility over the quarter is about 95%. Now 95%, 5% of the $2 billion revenue is $100 million. That is what we need to make up, and we have approximately 60 days to make this up. So it's important to note that the guidance is based on what we see and it's a statement the fact, and that's what we talk about. This quarter too, it is very similar. We are making a statement of fact that's based on all the factors we know. We'd include that deal pipeline, the customer velocity, the potential holidays, furloughs, there are challenges of internal transformation, all of those we consider. And that is where the caution comes from. It is also important to remember that you have seen -- we have seen volatility in our performance. If you look at the last 8 quarters, you will see volatility in our performance.", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. But in the manufacturing vertical, in particular last quarter during your call, you had some pretty cautious commentary but it ended up -- the quarter ended up ending -- ended up quite nicely. Did something happen during the quarter to where I think you had some cautious commentary about discretionary spending, specifically in the manufacturing vertical? Did that change?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So let me ask Sanjay Jalona to answer that.", "Sanjay Jalona", "So overall, we had a good growth in this quarter. We have seen all sectors, especially high-tech and automotive, starting to spend a little bit more than normal. We did see some investments, and going into miniscule [ph] business transformation, a lot of customers spending on digital and analytics, so that is what has propelled the growth. We see good growth pipeline and momentum going in and all the service lines have also grown-in this quarter.", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And one more quick one, Rajiv, sales and marketing is now nearly 6% of revenue. Should we expect this to be the new normal or should we expect further increases?", "Rajiv Bansal", "I think this is -- this one -- this will stabilize at this level plus-minus 0.5% here and there. I think if you look at -- compare our season, marketing expenses, the competition, I think we are the most efficient sales force, a very effective sales force. And I think we have made those investments in the last 2 quarters on our sales. We gave an 8% wage hike during May, and we've also increased the performance bonus for them. So I think is to control all that, I think we have made a lot of investments in the last 2 quarters on the sales and I think it will stabilize around this level in the near future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandeep Muthangi of IIFL.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "I have a question on margins. Rajiv, I'm trying to reconcile the margin breakup that you said. You said 300 bps negative because of the wage hike and then 250 bps positive because of the currency depreciation. So I'm just trying to see the net impact of these things, should that have been 50 bps, but the salary cost as a percentage of revenue have increased by about 160 bps quarter-on-quarter. Is this because of this performance bonus for the sales guys and perhaps any other metrics, any other salary-related event that are not included as a part of this 300 bps?", "Rajiv Bansal", "I told you, we have -- so what I had said was that we give a wage hike which had an impact of 300 basis points, set off by a rupee depreciation, which give an offset of 2.5%. These are operational parameters being much better in terms RPP utilization on-site mix and that set off against higher provision for bonuses and they will pay for our employees.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Can we quantify the bonus and the variable pay part, Rajiv?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. I think what we are saying is we have to pay our employees better. We have to make sure that they get -- people who are performing, they will get paid high variable pay. And all operational benefits that we have seeing in terms of improving the parameters have been drawn back. But I think it will be too much to break it up between how much of it has gone to variable pay, how much is going to this. But I think, overall, what we are saying is, if we perform well, if you do well on our operational parameters, some part of it will go back in the business, whether it's sales, whether it's employees, whether it's quality and productivity of the tools.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Okay. Just please help me with one thing then. Should we look at these performance bonuses and variable pay as a recurring event, that every quarter -- is this what is going to happen or is this kind of seasonal or the nonrecurring thing that has happened in 2Q?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, I think what we have done is now we have come to a level where we are very comfortable and we believe that this will drive a high-performance culture in the organization. So I think what we have done in the current quarter and quarter 2, up to current quarter, is I think going to be the right thing to do in terms of measuring the performance of people and driving a high-performance management in the company.", "Sandeep Muthangi - IIFL Research", "Okay, great. If I can have one question on the slight reorg that has been happening. Should we be going back from a purely vertical-based structure, which has happened during the last reorg, to a part-vertical-based structure and a part focused on the [indiscernible], so the emerging growth markets kind of structure. So what should we read into this? Is this because you want a higher focus on this or is it because you face some challenges with a vertical-based structure that this kind of reorg had happened?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we have actually created in this a virtually country P&Ls of 4 countries, Australia, China, Japan, Middle East and Southeast Asia. And these are being headed by the country heads and reporting [indiscernible], who will report them to me. The purpose of this is to bring in more focus in these areas. But the operation will continue to be somewhat joint. We want to make sure that the knowledge and benefits of the global industry verticals to flow into these countries and that will be taken care of at the ground level. We've also created a couple of new industry verticals. That is to drive growth. New people are taking up leader positions. And Steve Pratt is looking after Utilities and Resources, Ravi will look after the Life Sciences and Manish will look after Insurance. These are all new leaders who are coming up and who will look after new industry verticals and drive growth. So overall, it is all meant for increasing our focus and -- increasing our focus and creating velocity. Sharpen our focus on growth and also increasing client velocity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ankur Rudra of Ambit Capital.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Can you maybe help me with some of the margin benefits outside of currency you called this time? I can see utilization improvement, offshore shift and realization increase? Is it possible to enumerate the consolidated gains from these benefits?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Utilization improved by 2.4%. As I said, on-site mix of 0.8% and RPP of 0.6%. Put together, they would give us a benefit of about 150 basis points for the quarter.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "So given that the currency tailwind was counterbalanced by wage hike, are these incremental 150 basis points was basically taken up by the bonuses, which is what you spoke about?", "S. D. Shibulal", "The rupee depreciation gave us 250 basis points. The wage hike was a negative 300 basis points, so there's about 50 basis points drop offset by 150 basis points increase in the operational parameters. The balance of 100 basis points goes to additional bonuses and other expenses, other investments that we talked about.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Just to clarify this, additional 150 -- sorry, the 100 basis points is gone. Will this stay at this level every quarter or this is a one-off only in this quarter? I just want to clarify that point.", "Rajiv Bansal", "I think, as I'm saying, we have to pay our employees well. People -- people do perform. There are people who are actually performing very well. So I think this is a right level of payout that we have to give to our employees. And I believe that going forward also, we'll continue to provide at these levels.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Just on the -- these -- on x currency tailwinds you called this time, do you feel that the low hanging fruits on these levers have already achieved and it will be tougher to gain further gains on utilization in offshore shift?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Not really. We started on the cost optimization thing last quarter. We have incurred expenses for that, but the benefits will come on the subsequent quarter. Utilization is at 77.5%. I would expect utilization had a -- we can position to take it up to 82%, so we have a 4.5% lever there. Our on-site mix is still at 30.2%, shows potential to bring it down. So there are enough levers that are there. But I think a lot of this will depend on the growth. If we see good momentum, I think it goes to the flexibility to make changes much faster. So I think all these factors will play out in terms of how the margins will look like in the future.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Just finally on -- last question on margins, like you had historically quantified the result impact in 2Q, you are articulating the investments you'll be making towards other areas to make yourself more competitive in the long term. Is it possible to quantify the extent of that investment for the rest of the year?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, it is difficult, because a lot depends on your eligibility to make the investment. If you do well, you have good quarter growth, you see the upside in margin. A lot of that will flow back into the investment. So I think it's dependent on how growth is looking, and that's the reason that growth becomes very critical. If we see good growth, then we'll see how much of that can be invested, how much of the upside in the margin can be invested back in the business. But having said that, I think some of the variable pay that we are talking about are investments that we have to make going forward. So those have already been done this quarter. So I will not see an incremental impact of that coming in the subsequent quarters, but I think a lot of other investment you're talking about in terms of sales, quality productivity, delivery efficiency would depend on how we perform in terms of our growth.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "Just lastly on the guidance...", "Operator", "Excuse me, Mr. Rudra, sorry to interrupt. May we request you to return to the queue, please, as there are several participants waiting for their turn. Thank you so much. We'll take our next question from Sandeep Shah of CIMB.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "Just 2 questions in terms of the guidance. Is it -- are you assuming more furloughs in a higher seasonality versus what you used to assume in the last year? And secondly, in terms of -- and the second question is, Shibu, you made one of the comment that the volatility in terms of the growth to some extent is coming down? So is it fair to say that this may sustain going forward because of 2 reasons? One is the stop-and-start approach in your discretionary project has actually been improving? And the second our win ratio in the outsourcing and the order book is now improving to give us a less volatile growth going forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "The first question was about furloughs. We are not assuming anything out of ordinary at this point in time. Sanjay has expressed the concern about more furloughs because of the government shutdown, which can lead to different spending cut, which can lead to manufacturing sites taking more furloughs. But that has ended, we are not assuming that at this point in time into our prediction. We will assume normal. Media[ph] has also said something about furlough decisions after the Q3 closures in the financial industry. That also were not considered. We have considered somewhat similar to what we considered in the past, number one. Number two, regarding the volatility, what I said was that over the last 8 to 10 quarters, we have seen volatility. While we have seen growth over the last 4 quarters, most of the initiatives have started are very, very nascent. And it's too early for them to yield result and they will only yield result in the long term. I wouldn't -- in the last quarter, I was very clear that wouldn't consider this as a secular trend. I remain cautious even today. I remain cautious even today because of the reason, as I said, that most of the internal transformational stages which we are making to achieve all the stability is way too early. Because of that, I remain cautious. I wouldn't declare this as a secular trend.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "Just a follow-up on the discretionary project side, do you believe the stop-and-start approach is getting behind and there is more predictability on the ramp up of the leads?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the large outsourcing deals, we have won, but -- so you asked that also, so I'll answer both. On the large outsourcing deals, we have won, but we have not won enough, because a stock has to get built. A $1 billion win this year will only give us about 4%, or 4% to 6% this year and about 20% this year, which is not much in the scale at which we operate. We need to win more and create a stock, and that's what we are trying to do. On the discretionary spend, there is a bit more velocity, but again, the environment can be very volatile, right? We're starting to get a little bit more velocity, especially in the financial services space, but we started seeing volatility in the retail space. So financial space is getting better but retail space has become more volatile, and the government shutdown also, that didn't help. So we have considered that also into our guidance. It has improved. The overall environment has marginally improved, there is no doubt, but the discretionary spend also has improved by there are areas where we have seen bigger ratio.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraint, that was the last question. I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for spending time with us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Thank you, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we conclude this conference call.

I'm Sandeep from Investor Relations team in New York.", "Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Mr. S. D. Shibulal; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2014. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I will now transfer the call to Mr. S. D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you, Sandeep. Good evening, everyone. actually, good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call.", "I will begin by giving an overview of our performance of Q2. We have done fairly well in Q2. We grew 3.8% in reported currency terms in Q2. In constant currency terms, we have grown 4.2%. Our volume growth has been 3.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q2. Onsite volume increased by 0.7% and the offshore volume increased by 4.3%. Our realization increased marginally by 0.6% in reported currency terms and 0.9% in constant currency terms. In constant currency terms, the offshore revenue productivity went up by 1.7%, and the onsite revenue productivity went up by 2.0%. Our utilization also has gone up. Our utilization, excluding trainees, is at 77.5% as of end of Q2.", "We have seen very strong client additions in Q2. We have added 68 new clients, taking the total to 873. The net additional clients during Q2 has been 37. More importantly, 5 of those clients are Fortune 500 -- Global Fortune 500, which is a very good sign. These are the clients which will give us growth in the coming years. We have added 12,000 employees during Q2. Our total employees is [ph] to date is at 160,000 -- 160,227. Our operating margin is 21.9% after the provisioning we have done of $35 million. Without the provision, our operating margin is flat from Q1 to Q2 at 23.5%.", "Let me give you some color in different verticals. Let me start with financial services. We have seen some increased momentum during the last 3 months, both in U.S. and Europe. It is predominantly driven by additional spend in the area of new products and channels. We're also seeing interest in cloud and mobility -- increased interest in cloud and mobility compared with a year back. The spending on compliance and related matters continue in financial services. At the same time, we have seen positive momentum towards managed services, social media, and business-facing platforms and products. However, in financial services, the overall discretionary spend continues to be muted with a flat to negative outlook. Clients continue to focus on savings and reducing their operational costs. Vendor consolidation, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation continued to be interest -- continued to be of interest to clients in financial services.", "In retail and CPG, we are seeing a new wave of vendor consolidation happening. [indiscernible] marketing continues to see strong investment. At the same time, we are seeing strong focus on reducing nondiscretionary spend, and this one is leading to creation of large legacy opportunities for us. We are seeing a slowdown in large transformational leads in retail and CPG. In the area of business intelligence and digital commerce, we are seeing better momentum compared with last year.", "In manufacturing, the momentum in high-tech remains positive even though the client spend is relatively stagnant due to sluggishness in PC markets and slower growth in Europe and the emerging economies. We are seeing spending in automotive, aerospace and other industries, driven by increased spend on technologies like digital, connected vehicles and analytics. Global expansion continues to be a priority to our manufacturing clients. The primary growth driver for manufacturing will continue to be Americas, with Europe expected to see some challenges as some large transformational programs are nearing completion for us.", "Energy and utilities continued to see -- energy and utilities and communication service provider space continued to see challenges, especially the wireline telecom space continues to be a challenging area for us. We have been focused on increasing our revenue in wireless and cable during the last couple of years. While our percentage of revenue from wireless and cable has gone up, the -- it is early stages for us to mitigate the risk of the wireline space. There is limited discretionary spend in this vertical, and these projects are driven by the business. We are focused on proactively creating large deals, and that has led to better pipeline compared with the last years in this industry vertical.", "Now let me give you some color on our service offerings. Let me start with business and IT services. Overall, most deals in this space are focused on vendor consolidation, end-to-end application management and application modernization. We have won 5 large deals in this quarter with a TCV of approximately $450 million. Three of these deals were in FSI, one each in RCL and manufacturing. Two deals were in Americas, 2 in Europe and one in rest of the world. Most of the pipeline, most of the large outsourcing pipeline is driven by clients looking at restructuring existing spend with a bias towards ADM and infrastructure management. We are focused on winning large opportunities in -- with new revenue streams.", "We continued to see traction in our consulting and system integration space. We continued to win large transformational deals in the consulting and system integration space. Products and platform has shown traction during this quarter. We have 15 new wins, 8 in products and 7 in platforms. This quarter, our TCV won was 50% more than our TCV win in Q1. Today, our products and platform touches 80 clients across the globe. We have seen increased adoption of SaaS cloud-based software development, liberating IP and contract-level solutions over the last 2 quarters. We have, today, 200 engagements in the cloud space with 4,500 experts and 35 partners.", "Before I conclude, let me give you a brief update on some of the organizational changes we have done recently. We -- to bring in renewed focus in growth markets, we have combined Australia, China, Japan, Middle East and Southeast Asia into a unit with different P&Ls for each of those countries. These countries will be headed by respective country heads who will be responsible for revenue and onsite delivery and operations for these countries. These 4 country heads will report to Rajiv who will report them to me.", "We have also created 3 new vertical units, utilities and resources, insurance and life sciences, and they will be headed by Stephen Pratt, Manish and Pravin. Both BITS and CSA offering heads will now report to Kakal. We have done these changes to sharpen our focus on growth markets, consolidate our delivery operations, improve utilization and productivity, increase client velocity and improve accountability.", "Before I conclude, let me touch upon the guidance. We have changed our guidance to 9% to 10%. In the beginning of the year, we have started out with 6% to 10% as the growth guidance for the year. End of this quarter, beginning of second quarter, we had stuck with 6% to 10%, which meant in constant currency terms, 7.7% to 10.7%. The 9% to 10% guidance which we have given today is 9.9% to 10.9% in constant currency terms.", "We have not changed the top end of the guidance since we remain watchful of multiple factors. Number one, Q3 and Q4 are soft quarters for us. There are holidays and furloughs during Q3. More importantly, we have started on a transformational journey, internal -- a number of internal changes focused on cost optimization, increase in productivity and quality, increased sales effectiveness and creating a new model of global delivery, what we call VIDDM [ph]. These initiatives are very much in the early stages, and it is too early to derive benefits from these initiatives. These initiatives will take time to deliver benefits. Hence, we remain cautious, and we have changed our guidance to 9% to 10%.", "With this, let me now conclude and pass on to Rajiv to give further details on financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Shibu. Good morning, everyone. As Mr. Shibulal was saying, our revenues for the quarter grew sequentially by 3.8% in dollar terms, which, on a constant-currency basis, is at 4.2% growth. EPS for the quarter is at $0.67. This includes a provision of $35 million for visa-related matters. EPS without this provision is at $0.70 [ph], which is the same as last quarter. Excluding the provision for visa-related issues, the margin for the quarter is at 23.5%, same as that of last quarter. We saw significant volatility in currencies during this quarter, with the rupee depreciating by 16% intra-quarter and are average by 11%. We have outstanding hedges worth $1.1 billion as of September-end.", "As we have mentioned in our July earnings call, we have given an 8% commission increase to our sales staff effective 1st of May, 8% increase to our offshore staff and a 3% increase to our onsite staff effective 1st July. This has impacted our margins for Q2 by approximately 300 basis points. The benefit of rupee depreciation has been offset primarily by salary hikes.", "Our net margin is at 18.5% for the quarter, primarily because of a charge that we have taken for the Visa-related matter. Excluding visa, margins are at 20.2% as against 21% previous quarter. The reduction is on account of lower interest income in dollar terms because of rupee depreciation and a change loss because of extreme currency volatility.", "Our cash and cash equivalents, including available-for-sale assets, is at $4.297 billion as against $4.054 billion last quarter. Our DSO is at 62 days as against 66 days in the previous quarter. As Mr. Shibulal was saying, we have revised our guidance to 9% to 10% for the full year. Our revised October guidance is restated based on last year average rate will be 9.9% to 10.9% for the full year.", "With this, I open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I wondered if you could give us some color -- I know you haven't given guidance on it, but if you talk a little bit about your thoughts on margins through the back half of this year and maybe heading into next year. It seems like the business is starting to stabilize so you may have maybe better visibility on what that profile might look like. So maybe we could start with the margins.", "Rajiv Bansal", "This is Rajiv. If you look at the margins, margin of the company for the last 3 quarters, it has -- it is at 23.5% operating margins. We have seen couple of good quarters in the last couple of -- in the last 8 quarters. We have seen some bad quarters. So I think one of the primary focus that we have is to ensure that we invest back in the business, we get the good momentum and we see the productivity in our revenues. Now what we are doing is we are investing into our sales engine. We are getting the -- we are working on the sales effectiveness. We are investing the money back into the employees. We gave a wage hike to employees, considering that employee morale is one of the issues that we need to tackle. Attrition is one thing that we need to focus on. We have increased available pay. We have changed our commission structure to increased more of fixed component. We have increased available pay and that bonuses for the employees and the provisions we made for that. So I think what we are doing is trying to create a growth engine, which will give us sustainable growth at superior margins in the future. And that's the reason -- anything that we are seeing more than 23.5% in the last 3 quarters have been put back into business to make this investment. Some of these investments will give us returns in the medium to long term. We still have levers to improve our margins, the utilization. Utilization is at 77.5%, excluding trainees. I would like it to go up to 82%, which is another 4.5%, which should give us a production in the margin. Our onsite effort makes us still at 30.2%. One of the initiatives that we are running is to bring it down, which will give us, again, further levers in the margin. So there are many levers that we have on the margin. But I think the primary focus is right now in this year has been to ensure that we invest back in the business. We create a good momentum. We have a good pipeline. We ensure that we are -- we have a very efficient delivery engine, and we invest in quality and productivity, in the tools, in the products, in the platforms, which should give us sustainable growth -- superior growth at superior margins. I think, for this year, I would say that our margins would remain in this narrow range with plus/minus 1% to what we have today. I think the exits [ph] of the margin for this year is very important. Some of the initiatives we will take on the cost optimization will start easing benefits towards the end of this year. And I think if we are able to exit this year at good margins, that will set the flow for the next year.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Got it. So just to be clear, your -- the margin or holding the margin at this 23.5%, that's due to reinvestment, not due to any kind of changes in the pricing methodology.", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. If you look at the last 3 quarters, the reported revenue per employee that we have reported has been almost stable. The last 2 quarters, it was down by 0.7%, and this quarter, it's up by 0.6%. On a constant-currency basis, up by 0.9%. So we are seeing the pricing environment to be stable. We are not seeing a very volatile pricing environment. So I think that is a good sign. So the margin that we're seeing is primarily because of initiatives we have taken to focus on making the investment, which will give us returns in the long run.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Sure, okay, and the last question for me. There's been an exit of a number of different managers. Maybe you could talk about quiet reaction to that and any color you could provide on the visa issues. So any color you can provide on the managers that you see leave the organization, the client reaction and anything you can say about the visa reserve?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think we have seen exit of 2 or 3 people, not many, 2 or 3 people. It is an organization with 160,000 people with a very, very deep leadership pool. Over the last 12 years, as early as 2002, we have started investing in leadership development. We have 45 people in Tier 1 leadership, 150 people in Tier 2 leadership and close to 300-plus people in Tier 3 leadership, which means we have large number of leadership -- large number of people in the leadership pool with very deep experience. Our people are some of the best in the industry. It is quite natural for them to look at other opportunities. Some of them will find aspirational opportunities outside. It is part of our life. Our relationship with our -- and the more importantly, the fact that we have the deep leadership pool allows us to transition almost seamlessly. For example, Ashok Vemuri's portfolio has been taken over by Sanjay Jalona who has been waiting for this for more than 13 years. And now more importantly, our current client relationships are definitely multilevel. We have relationships at multiple levels with the client. So I will have relationship with the clients, Chris [ph] will have, the industry vertical head will have, the regional head will we have and because of that one person's change, one change. And it could be because the person has taken up a new responsibility within the organization or a person who is looking to moving out of the organization, we are able to manage it almost seamless. There are other relationships. There are multiple relation touch points with the clients, and that's exactly what we have done in the recent cases, also. So that is the one question. The second was on the visa. See, we are engaged in discussions with the U.S. Attorneys' office and that the government department regarding a civil resolution of the government investigation into the company's compliance", "[Technical Difficulty] and form requirements and past use of given [ph] reserves. Based on the status of these decisions, we have set aside a reserve of $35 million, including legal costs. Because these discussions are ongoing, we are unable to provide additional details at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. So it sounds like you're implying you're essentially capping your operating margin at around 23.5% in the near-term despite the big boost that you're receiving from rupee depreciation even over the last 3 months. So if it's accurate that you're essentially pegging your operating margin in that 23.5% range in the near-term? What do you see as your long-term aspiration for operating margin, recognizing that you're pursuing some pretty important cost optimization initiatives? It sounds like you're maybe having an aspiration to get margins back to a higher level, but I just wanted to probe on that some.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Absolutely, we have an aspiration to have superior margins better than anybody else in this industry. And that has always been our aspiration, and that continues to be our aspiration. See, what we are seeing now is that we planned to give wage hike to our employees even when we didn't know about the rupee depreciation this quarter. We announced wage hike in the middle of June when there was no signs of rupee depreciating the way it did. So I think the important message is that we are making investments even if it shows up on the margins or it results in lower margins in the current quarter or the subsequent quarter. I think the important part for us is to ensure that we create the momentum. We invest in all the right things. We invest in our employees, we invest in the sales, we invest in delivery, we invest in quality productivity. And if you do all the right things, definitely, the growth will come back. And if the growth comes back, the margin will automatically come back. So I think my -- in all the earlier interaction that I had with the investors and analysts, I've been saying that, \"Don't look at margins this year on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Please look at what our exit margins are going to be for this year because that will set the flow for the next year.\" On our aspirations, our aspirations are to have the best margins in the industry, and that will obviously remain so.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last quarter, we asked some about any new high-level strategic plans and you guys emphasized that you're going to be more focused on winning large outsourcing deals. Can you give us a further update on any additional modifications to your strategic direction? And in particular, can you address whether you're moving towards more centralized decision-making and leadership?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the large outsourcing deals, we have been focused on the large outsourcing deals over the last 18 months. If you look at the second half of last year, we won close to $1 billion of large outsourcing deals. Given that these deals are multiyear deals, they give about 4% of the revenue in the first year and about 20% next year. In fact, it takes a couple of quarters for these deals to ramp up. And you have seen in the last 2 quarters, those deals which we won last year second half delivering some revenue. This half, the first half of this year also, we have won to close to $1 billion of large outsourcing deals. I expect that in the next couple of quarters, not in the next quarter, in the next couple of quarters, these deals will deliver revenue and that will allow us to grow. At the same time, these deals are extremely price sensitive. They're very competitive, and sometimes, very difficult to differentiate in these deals. So our focus is to execute them effectively. That is where are one of our major initiatives on productivity and quality improvement come into picture. It is about increasing productivity. It is about increasing efficiency and making sure that while these deals may be obtained at a lower than our margin -- lower than our average margin, we can achieve our average margin during the lifetime of these programs. So that is what we are trying to do in that space. You had a second question?", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes. I was wondering if you're doing anything organizationally to centralize decision-making in leadership, such as moving some of your senior staff back to India to have more centralized decision-making?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, we are not. In fact, we continue to focus on -- differently. And hence, in fact, each of the industry vertical operate as P&Ls. We have now created a new P&L for the growth markets. So we are continuing on our journey of enabling leaders at the next level to own a P&L and take decisions.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And are you tightening the reins on pricing or are you still in an environment where you need discretion on pricing in order to drive the growth that you need right now?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We will always make discretion on pricing at whatever level it is. Whether it is at my level, next level, next, next level, I think we will always need to balance growth and pricing. It is very, very important that we win our deals at our aspiration margins. If we don't, we make sure that we achieve our aspiration margins during the life of those deals by multiple interventions. So whether the decision is made at my level, which it is not, or any other level, pricing will continue to be something which we need to watch out for.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I was curious to dig in a little bit more on the impact of the larger transactions that you've been chasing of late, just sort of what percentage revenue contribution they may be offering. And also, you talked about price realization being roughly flat, but that -- it benefits from an improving utilization. So I was curious what the -- sort of the apples-to-apples pricing component of realization was?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the large deals, as I said, if we win about $1 billion of large deals this year. It will be approximately 20%, that is $200 million next year. We need to continue to win. I actually said it multiple times during the day that we have not won enough. For a company of our size, with $8 billion of revenue, we need to win a large -- more large deals, and that is what we are focused on. We have a pretty good pipeline, but these deals are highly competitive and also price-sensitive. The winning mostly happens based on the single dissolution. So everything we have done creating business in IT operations, consulting and system integration, our ability to build multi-tower deals, senior people being involved in creating solutions, all of that -- and all of that is contributing toward these wins. Regarding the pricing, it is apples-to-apples because the pricing, which is the revenue realization which we talked about, is billed revenue realization. It is not gross revenue realization, it is billed revenue realization, so there is no impact of utilization on the revenue realization which we talked about. Our revenue productivity per billed employee went up by 0.6% in reported currency terms and 0.9% in constant currency terms.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Just to answer your question on utilization improvement. Yes, we did see 2.4% improvement in utilization during the quarter, which does give us a benefit on the margins. But as I said, we had a gain of 250 basis point because of rupee depreciation during the quarter, our rate impact was 300 basis points to -- for that margin, should have come down to 50 basis points. Some of that was offset by implementing revenue productivity and utilization.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the Indian market? We are continuing to hear that, that domestic market is -- has sort of gotten quiet for everybody or maybe so price-sensitive that service providers are being more reluctant to pursue it.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me request Raghu to respond to that question.", "Raghupathi C. N.", "The Indian market, of course, is price-sensitive, but there is a lot of opportunity over here because India as a country -- the entire subcontinent is under-invested in IT. The challenge for all of us service providers is to find new ways of delivering services like cloud, mobility, et cetera. 2 or 3 things that come to mind, one is the last-mile connectivity is the biggest problem. We are executing some exciting projects over here. Of course, being an election year, there's a little bit of quiet in the central government or in this -- the central government spending. The states, of course, continue to spend, and the private sector continues to spend. It's an exciting market but has its own challenges in terms of the way people buy and the price sensitivity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just wanted to start out, Q1 and Q2 sequential growth were quite good, and it looked a lot like the average of the last 5 years. When you put together all the last 5 years together, it looked a lot like the average of that. But the way that you're guiding the Q3 and Q4 would kind of imply the worst quarters of the last 5 years. And it doesn't feel like the environment is kind of back where we were 3 years ago or so when -- or 4 years ago when things were really slow. It feels more like things are at least decent. So I'm just wondering why we're kind of looking at growth going forward that's more like the worst of the last 5 years?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So as you look at the last 5 quarters, almost -- every quarter, not almost, every quarter we have grown. But if you look at the last 8 quarters, you can clearly see that we have faced some volatility. Even in the last 5 quarters, where we have grown every quarter, there has been difference in growth rates. So we remain cautious, number one. Number two, Q3 and Q4 are traditionally weak quarters for us. It has nothing to do with the environment. Traditionally, Q3 and Q4 are competitively weak quarters for us. In the last quarter -- or last year, slightly different. But if you look at the last many years, you will see that Q3 and Q4 are traditionally weak quarters. And there are a number of reasons. Number one, Q3 has more holidays, furloughs. It is at the end of the year, the budgets are coming to an end. So if there is no budget flush then the spending will taper off. And Q1 is a quarter in which new budgets come online. We have to win those budgets, and then start delivering to those. So those are the external factors but, more importantly, there are internal factors. While we have seen growth in Q3 and then Q1 and Q2, we have started these new initiatives that have -- we have started a number of new initiatives inside. We have started to introduce some cost management on sales force effectiveness, increasing productivity and quality and increasing our offshore through VIDDM [ph]. All of these are in nascent stages. If will take a few quarters before the benefits will start flowing in. Because of these factors and because of the fact that we have seen volatility in the last 8 quarters, we are entering soft quarters. The internal changes are to yield material benefits. We have to remain cautious. We are reviewing the guidance, we have changed our guidance to 9% to 10%, which is 9.9% to 10.9% in constant currency terms. As we have said in the past, our guidance is a statement of fact as we see it today. We have looked at our pipeline. We have looked at our wins. We have looked at our clients. We have looked at our client furloughs during the quarter. We have looked at all of those, and we feel that this is the right guidance at this point in time. We are cautious.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great, great. And secondly, just when you look for that M&A opportunity -- Lodestone was a nice add late last year and helped this year, are there other things you look to do just given your big cash balance? It seems like a lot of your competitors are making acquisitions, too.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we have just announced a 400% dividend, INR 20 per share. We have always given cash back to investors as Infosys [ph] felt that it is better utilizing our investors' hand and we are not using it. We have aspirations to do acquisitions, something in the products and platforms space, something in -- probably, in the life sciences space, something in public service. But these are critical investments for us. Last year, we have done the Lodestone acquisition. The integration with Venturi is complete. We are going to market with them and we are starting to see some benefits. We have to make the right decision when it comes to acquisition. So we are looking for opportunities, at the same time, they are very, very strategic, and to be done with a lot of thought, and that is what we are trying to do.", "David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great, okay. Finally, just tax rate, just to make sure we're clear on this. Year-to-date, you're at about 26.5% tax rate. Is that pretty stable probably the rest of the year? I guess that's a lot like last year as well?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. I think tax rate has been between 26% and 27%. Effective tax rate has been in that range and it will continue to be in that range of -- I think in this financial year and probably in the next financial year, too.", "Operator", "The next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Looking into Europe which was pretty solid during the quarter, can we kind of dive a bit more into what we're seeing in terms of growth out of the U.K. versus Continental Europe, and then, which regions in Continental Europe are showing the most promise?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So let me request B.G. to respond to that.", "B. G. Srinivas", "With respect to Europe, again, in the macro, we have definitely seen a fair degree of stabilization. We have seen, even in the last quarter, all indicators turning to be slightly positive, including the economic sentiment indicator. If you look at what it has as an impact on our clients across sectors, the deal actively has [indiscernible] in terms of sectors, we see retail, energy utilities, telco and the financial services pick up in U.K., which is the most mature market in Europe. Particularly in the continent, the Germany -- German market is opening up for sure. We have participated in several large deal opportunities, 2 in manufacturing and 1 in retail, which we have won in the last 2 quarters. So this is a market where we have invested significantly in building our local presence in nearshore centers as well as our acquisition of Lodestone, which has a significant presence in Germany, has helped us both participate and win opportunities in Germany. Switzerland and Benelux region has always been more mature, though they are small markets. We have good traction in financial services and manufacturing in these 2 geographies as well as in life sciences. Beyond this, we see in the last 6 months, Nordics also opening up, though Nordics is a fragmented market. But there again, energy, financial services, manufacturing are sectors where we are seeing deal activity and we are increasing our presence in Nordics to capture these opportunities as well. France is a market while it's large, it's still slow at this point in time. However, we also have certain opportunities which will mature for the fiscal year '14, and we are actively pursuing them. But amongst the constant markets, Germany, Nordics, Benelux and Switzerland are the markets which are opening much more than France.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then is it possible to get sequential growth rates in Europe by the U.K. and then by Continental Europe? And then, is it also possible to get the sequential growth out of Europe, excluding Lodestone?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Today, if you look at the overall revenue share, U.K. has about 48 to 50 queries on a quarterly basis, so about roughly close to 50% of the market come -- is from U.K. Rest is distributed across the continent. However, we do not share the country-specific numbers at this point in time. It's not in the public domain.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then if you exclude Lodestone, sequential in Europe?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, the Lodestone integration is a very tight integration. It is not like a -- it may look like a subsidiary, but it's no more a subsidiary from an integration perspective. What we have done is, in Europe, we have moved our consulting folks into Lodestone, so these are not the ones still in Lodestone. So by taking out Lodestone, we will actually take out a lot of our revenue, old revenue which we had. So we will not be able to give you segregated growth. What is the growth in...", "Rajiv Bansal", "Europe had seen a 5.2% growth quarter-on-quarter, this quarter. But there has been some currency -- cross-currency benefits on Europe. If you exclude that, it is in line with the company growth this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I have a couple as well, too. The first one is, if you could just talk about, at a minimum, directionally, your contracted backlog today at this time versus last year and/or pipeline in a dollar value basis today versus last year? And are you seeing any difference in that pipeline and backlog in terms of yield or duration of how that will unfold into revenue?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the pipeline, I would consider similar to what we had last year. We have a pretty -- I wouldn't say it's strong, but robust pipeline for large outsourcing deals. We have added a number of clients, so the clients that is in there have been pretty strong. And that also is a reflection of our pipeline. We have added 67 new clients out of the 37 net additions. We have won large outsourcing deals, 5 of them, adding up to $450 million. So our pipeline today is quite similar to what we had last year this time, and it includes also a large outsourcing deal as well as transformational deals.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So you're suggesting that the dollar amount of that pipeline is roughly flat with what it was last year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "It is -- approximately, same. I wouldn't say it is materially different.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And are you expecting a different yield of that pipeline? In other words, how that pipeline may transition to revenue?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Our yield has gone up because, as you look at our large outsourcing deal wins over the last few quarters, it has gone up. Compared with what it was 2 years back, it has gone up. Transformational deals, the yield has not changed but the velocity has come down, right, because of the discretionary spend tightened and the velocity has come down.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Then the second question for me is, on your calls, you mentioned what your utilization rate is, it's up for both. Including trainees and excluding trainees, it's been up sequentially for about 6 straight quarters, 7 straight quarters. Would you anticipate that continuing to go up as we -- for the next couple of quarters? And is there any targets that you're thinking about for your utilization levels?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So these are 2 different numbers. Including trainees, will go up and down, right, because I can get in -- I can get that 5,000 people to join tomorrow morning, my utilization is up, including trainees. So that's all a number to look at from a long-term perspective because there are seasonalities, just simple seasonalities on that number. And there were a large number of people joining the Mysore campus. Our utilization, including trainees, will come down. So I really don't track it in that sense. I track the utilization, excluding trainees. Now the excluding trainee utilization is 77.5%. With our scale, we should be able to achieve somewhere in between 80% to 82%, so there is still headroom to improve utilization.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, okay, fair enough. And then the final one for me is you've provided some guidance for the top line, and I was just wondering if you care to make any comments on how you think free -- your cash flow is up about 11% for the year in the first 2 quarters, would you anticipate that your growth of cash flow would follow the current trend or near the growth that you're anticipating in revenues?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I think this quarter, we have done exceeding well to collect our receivables. Our days of sales outstanding has fallen from 66 days to 62 days. We have collected almost about $2.12 billion this quarter alone. So I think that said, it also shows the quality of revenues and our focus on collections. And I think we'll have to -- I will not predict the cash flows going forward because it depends on a lot of factors in terms of billings and the collections and investments, but I would say that we are a very focused company in terms of having a very, very healthy cash flow. And we track the cash flow as a percent of the operating profit and the net profit and use it as a measure to -- as a parameter to measure our performance.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if we could go back to some of the momentum that you have in the large contract market, and some of your commentary about that these are cost-competitive deals but you're focused on cost optimization on these contracts to realize the target margin. Can you help us better understand how these contracts are structured and what the profitability of these contracts look over their life cycle?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So these contracts are multiyear contracts. There will be some productivity gains guaranteed. There may or may not be, but there are -- more often than not, there are productivity gains guaranteed within the contract. These will -- some of them would be managed services contract, whereas -- which means that their [indiscernible] we hand contract. And there are stringent SLAs in these contracts. These are large outsourcing contracts. We are not talking about interest -- we are not talking about how to hardware or [indiscernible], we are talking about services. They are price-sensitive. They are highly competitive. And they generally come below our average margins when we bill [ph] them. That is why we have to focus on these large outsourcing contracts, improve their margins through multiple levers. Number one is productivity improvement. Number two is around tools and automation. Number three is adjusting the on-site, offshore ratio. Number four is making sure that the right set of people are around these programs, with the right sector of the pyramid. So there are multiple levers which we have which we can use over the period of the contract to make it closer to our average -- more than closer, equal to our average margins. And that is what we do. But when you are in a ramp-up phase with all of these contracts, you have to get to steady state to start doing some of these improvements. When you start up a number of them simultaneously, you may see a short-term impact on the margins.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So in a typical contract, these like a 3- to 5-year kind of deal, is it the first year or 2 where you're below your target and as you get into years, let's say 3 or so, you hit your target, or is it a different trajectory?", "S. D. Shibulal", "That's what it is. Somewhat similar to what you said.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then second, Shibu, as you look at the change in your business mix, the change in the pricing structure of some of the more mature segments of the industry, can you help us better understand how you are thinking about the on-site, offshore mix? And any plans that you may have to increase your on-site hiring? And this is totally independent of the immigration bill but really more focused on business mix and where you see the market going.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we have 2 -- actually, 2 distinct answers to this. Number one, we are focused on reducing our on-site effort. Our on-site effort is comparatively higher now compared with our past. I have seen of around 30% as below -- as low as -- somewhere between 27% to 28% in the past. And today, we are at 32%. Quarter-on-quarter, it has come down by 0.8%, so we have come down to 31.2%. You see now reducing on-site is a good way for us to provide better value to our clients, to create scale for ourselves because we can scale much faster offshore. And then clients are also very interested in reducing on-site and doing more work offshore. The immigration bill is definitely a driving force in this thought process, there's no doubt. But irrespective of the bill, it makes sense for us to implement new methodologies, new technologies, which can reduce our on-site effort. Now recruitment on-site, that's a completely different aspect. We shall -- maybe look -- we will have people on-site. We will have effort on-site. Now today, we use local recruits and the purities. We are looking forward to recruiting more and more local and even some qualities locally to create local talent. As we do more and more transformation programs, as we do more and more mission-critical programs with our clients, it makes perfect sense to have local talent in the countries in which we operate.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So is one way to offset, for example, the impact of more local hiring for those types of projects by increasing -- you offset that with increasing offsite mix, if you will, in the core business?", "S. D. Shibulal", "That is true because our different businesses will operate with a different on-site, offshore ratio. BPO operates at 10%. Infrastructures then probably operate at 20%. Consulting and system integration will operate at 40%. At the end of the day, it is about lowering -- it is about managing the portfolio and lowering the mix.", "David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I see, okay. And then just one last question. I think this may have come up a little bit earlier, but I mean I think we're all looking at this massive move in currency and just wondering how do you manage? If the rupee regains some momentum and normalizes kind of at a much higher level relative to the dollar, I mean how do we think about kind of your ability to navigate through that if, in fact, you have the rupee returning to more historic levels versus the dollar?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have operated when rupee was $46 a rupee -- we are operating at INR 46 to $1. Now we are operating at INR 61, it was INR 66. We're operating in this volatile environment for a very long period of time, as long as the rupee is not drastically volatile during the end of the quarter. If the rupee moves drastically at the end of the quarter, the last month of the quarter, there's inability for us further to do anything about it. But if it is a gradual shift, we will be able to manage and that's what we have done in the past.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions from the participants, I now hand the conference back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call and spending time with us. We look forward to talking to you again in future. Thanks, and have a good day. Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, members of the management team. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Ms. Gargi Ray of Infosys.", "Thank you, and over to you, ma'am.", "Gargi Ray", "Thanks, Inba. Hello, everyone, and wish you all a very Happy New Year. I'm Gargi from the Investor Relations Team in Mysore. I would like to welcome you to our Quarter 3 FY '14 earnings call. Joining us today on this call is CEO and Managing Director, S.D. Shibulal; Presidents, Mr. B.G. Srinivas and Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We will start the call with opening remarks on the business before opening the call up for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement which will be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Mr. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good morning, everyone. Let me take this opportunity to wish you a Happy New Year. We had a decent Q3. Our revenues grew by 1.7% in reported currency terms and 1.2% on constant currency basis. On-site volumes declined by 3.4% while the offshore volumes increased by 2.6%, overall volume increase of 0.7%.", "Our offshore referred mix went up by 1.3%. Our operating margin expanded by 1.5% sequentially, excluding the impact of provisions for visa-related matters that were made in Q2. We added 54 new clients. The number of $1 million clients went up by 26. Our growth was predominantly in non-U.S. geographies and Asian [ph] verticals.", "External business environment has improved marginally in most business segments. While clients are becoming more confident about spending, they remain careful when it comes to making spending decisions. Budgeting activity for our client is moving on a timely basis. Overall, across verticals, we see mixed trends regarding 2014 budgets. We expect the budgets to be flat from 2013 to 2014.", "At the same time, we expect the clients to be focused on cost optimization. This gives us opportunity to create solutions which will reduce their total cost of ownership. B.G. and Pravin will elaborate on verticals and budgets subsequently.", "Pricing continues to be stable. However, we continue to see pricing pressure on large outsourcing deals and commoditized services. Infosys Edge continues its momentum with 14 wins this quarter, 8 in platforms and 6 in products. We continue to invest and see traction in the strategic areas: social, mobile, analytics, cloud.", "At cloud verticals, these technologies are opening up newer opportunities. While each of these is individually powerful, the true value of the client is when these technologies come together to drive their business agenda. A relevant example is Tradex, an insights-driven sales platform that we launched in Q3, which clients are using to sense and fulfill client -- consumer demand in emerging markets. In this platform, we use analytics capability to gain visibility across distribution channels. We use mobile capability to empower the distributors and the sales force -- and the distributor sales force to accelerate order intake. Lastly, this platform is delivered on the cloud to help clients drive lower cost and accelerate rapid penetration into new markets.", "We have realigned our business portfolio to further enhance our focus on deepening client relationships, increasing market share, creating service differentiation and agility in execution. We have appointed B.G. Srinivas and Pravin Rao as Presidents. B.G. will focus on global markets and Pravin will focus on global delivery and service innovation, along with their business portfolios.", "We had earlier expanded the Executive Council so that the heads of units and business functions can participate in Executive Council deliberations. We had multiple transformations in progress. However, under the new structure, now that we have implemented 2 presidents, they will put in place appropriate governance sectors for their respective areas. Hence, the Executive Council has been disbanded effective April 1.", "Based on our performance from Q1 to Q3 and what we expect in Q4, we have increased our revenue guidance to 11.5% to 12%. This will be 12.4% to 12.9% in constant currency terms.", "I will now ask B.G. to talk about his business segments. B.G.?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Thanks, Shibu. Good morning to all of you. I will now cover the following business segments: financial services, manufacturing, energy and telecommunications. I will be brief about the sectors and will be happy to take questions as we go forward.", "In financial services, we continue to see clients significantly focusing on taking out cost from their operations and, definitely, some of those are diverting those savings into investing and creating new products and services. Digital transformation risk and compliance-related spending, modernization of infrastructure and legacy applications are influencing some of these spendings. Pipeline is relatively healthy and comprises a good mix of large deals as well as there's an uptick in the focus on platform-related deals for Infosys. At the sector level, we have definitely seen a pickup of the spend momentum in the last 2 quarters. The client IT spend outlay for the coming year is a big mixed bag. We see, in some of our clients, there is a relatively flat budget. In some, there is an uptick in budgets. But overall, we see a greater degree of stability in the way the budget outlay pans out.", "Switching to the next sector, manufacturing. We see, by and large, the business momentum remaining stable. While we see some improvements in the automotive, commercial, aerospace and industrial manufacturing, there is definitely some weakness in the high-tech sector which is putting pressure on the discretionary spend in this particular vertical. Information management, analytics, digital consumer are some of the key themes emerging in the sector and helping -- creating a transformed -- a transformation of sorts within the clients' business.", "There is also a lot of focus within the manufacturing segment and in simplification of the internal processes and consolidation. The budgets are expected to be flat overall for the sector, while we definitely see some decline in budget, specifically in the high-tech sector, due to the impact of reduced PC sales. While in automotive, commercial aerospace and industrial manufacturing, we are seeing increased budgets.", "Switching over to the next sector, the telecom industry continues to face challenges and this is not surprising. The spend levels are muted as clients continue to see revenue challenges which are keeping a check on both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend.", "The pipeline is healthy in only a few pockets. We are definitely looking at newer means of creating opportunities as the sector continues to face challenges going into the coming fiscal year. The budget outlay for this vertical in the telecom does not indicate any respite so there are expected budget cuts.", "The energy sector is doing pretty well. We see a great degree of stability. The IT spend is both on discretionary and nondiscretionary spend. There is a lot of focus, again, on consolidation of typically, most of these sectors have large ERP landscapes. There's consolidation, simplification, and in some cases, we also see re-implementations, and in a few cases, upgrades. And within instances, we are very well positioned to address some of these challenges for our clients. Overall, again, as we look into the fiscal year 2015 for all the sectors barring telecom, we are much more optimistic as we look forward as compared to where we were at this point in time last year.", "With this, I would now hand over to Pravin to cover his business portfolios.", "U. B. Pravin Rao", "Thanks, B.G. Good morning. In retail, CPG and logistics, we have seen increased spend in the areas of cloud, infrastructure, business intelligence, analytics and ERP-led transformation. We are seeing an uptick in discretionary spend. However, they remain in a stop-start mode. The deal pipeline has improved marginally over the last 3, 4 quarters. We expect the budgets to remain flat with an upward bias for the coming year.", "In Life Sciences on the other hand, we have some headwinds in terms of patent cliff [ph] . There is still some transparency leading to an opportunity for us in terms of large outsourcing deals. We also see continued investments on ERP-led transformation, but there is definitely a lot of pressure on budgets and we expect budgets in this segment to be either flat or probably marginally down.", "In the per person utilities vertical, we see a lot of focus on cost optimization as well as investment in cloud, mobility and analytics. In addition, in global resources, companies are also focusing on simplifying their operations and improving supply chain efficiency. Budgets for the sector are down due to revenue challenges facing the clients.", "In the growth markets, unit comprising of Australia, China, Japan and Southeast Asia and Middle East, we see different dynamics that play in individual markets. There is focus on cost reduction and consolidation of spend in Australia. In China, clients are investing in ERP and analytics as they look at centralizing their operations. In Japan, demand is being driven by the need to simplify IT and drive revenue-generating spending. Overall, in the region, the deal pipeline is decent, though the ticket size is small.", "In the services sector, the new age information services companies leveraging digital are seeing increasing spend, while the traditional print media is cutting spend. The travel and hospitality segment is seeing an uptick in spend driven by economic stabilization and mild recovery in the U.S.", "Coming to cloud and Big Data, in this quarter, we have won over 20 engagements in cloud and Big Data. Cloud is driving the IT organization towards more outcome-based, SLA-oriented constructs. Clients are also excited about the possibility for contestability and open standards that would help eliminate vendor lock-in and maximize performance.", "In mobility, we have started over 25 engagements in quarter 3 in the areas of sales force, automation, device management and enterprise productivity. Clients are looking to establish mobile lab factories to cater to their mobility requirements, thus preferring to opt for platform-independent technologies over native frameworks. We see good levels of interest for managed pay-per-use models.", "I will now pass on to Rajiv to elaborate on the financial performance.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Pravin. A very happy New Year to all of you. Let me take you through the financial highlights for the quarter. Our third quarter revenues were $2.1 billion, as against $2.066 billion in the previous order, a growth of 1.7% in reported terms and 1.2% in constant currency terms. In INR, the revenue was at INR 13,026 crores, a sequential growth of 0.5%, primarily because of the rupee appreciation of 1.2% during the quarter. Our gross margins for the quarter improved by 80 basis points to 36.1%. The operating margins for the quarter have improved by 1.5% to 25%, mainly on account of initiatives to increase efficiency in our operations. Net margin for the quarter expanded to 22.1% compared to 18.6% in Q2 which, excluding the visa-related matter, was at 20.2%.", "EPS is at INR 50.32 as compared to INR 45.96 last quarter excluding the visa charge, which is a sequential growth of 9.5%. Our revenue per person increased by 2.2% on a sequential basis both on-site and offshore. Our on-site mix has fallen from 31.2% to 29.9%, and utilization, excluding trainees, is marginally down to 76.9%.", "Our other income was higher by INR 221 crores as against the previous quarter, mainly on account of ForEx gain of INR 119 crores in Q3, versus a ForEx loss in last quarter of INR 87 crores. As you will recollect, last quarter, we witnessed extreme volatility in the currency market which resulted in the loss of INR 87 crores previous quarter.", "During the quarter, on the average, rupee was at INR 62.03 as against INR 62.77, an appreciation of 1.2%. We have outstanding hedges of $1.049 billion as of December end. Effective tax rate of the quarter, 18 months, it is at 27.9%. Our cash flows from operations during the quarter is at INR 2,745 crores, which is a very healthy 95% of the net profit. After paying dividends of INR 1,339 crores and CapEx of INR 159 [ph] crores in the quarter, our cash and cash equivalents, including available-for-sale assets and certificates of deposits, is at INR 27,440 crores.", "We have increased our FY '14 revenue guidance in dollar terms to 11.5% to 12%. This is based on what we achieved in the first 3 quarters and based on our expectations for the fourth quarter.", "Lastly, I would like to reiterate that, while we have seen early results of our initiatives to increase efficiency, we continue to evaluate our business needs and make investments wherever necessary.", "With that, I open the floor to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Anantha Narayan of Credit Suisse.", "Anantha Narayan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I had 2 questions. The first one for Rajiv, and If you just look at the implied guidance for the 4Q, the lower end obviously suggests a slight revenue decline. Are you just being conservative or do -- that seems a bit surprising given that December, typically, is a seasonally weak quarter. And the second one, to Shibu also, just on the new org structure. It just seems a bit strange that it's just 2 or 3 months back since you have expanded the Executive Council significantly, and now, you sort of decided to disband it. I would love to understand what really transpired in the last 2 or 3 months that would change the management's thinking on the structure?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Let me do the first question. I think if you look at our guidance of 11.5% to 12%, it implies a Q4 number of minus 0.4% to 1.4% growth for the fourth quarter. This is based on what we see today. I think it is not about being conservative or being aggressive. It is what we see today. Q4 is, again, a seasonally weak quarter. If we look at the number of working days, because of February being the shorter month, it's the start of the client budget cycles. The client budgets have to get closed. They have to be transferred into orders and then we have [indiscernible] . So usually the fourth quarter is always a weaker quarter and considering what we see today, I think -- we believe that it will be somewhere in the range of the guidance that we have given.", "S. D. Shibulal", "This is Shibu. As you may notice that over the last few months, we have been transforming ourselves to drive efficiency, to drive clients' efficiency to create better solutions and to achieve higher levels of growth and margins. As part of that, we felt that it is important that a wider set of people participate in these deliberations. And with that, we had expanded the Executive Council. At the same time, the 2 presidents that serve this [ph] that we have put in place just now, has been a work in progress and now, we have done it. We have created 2 presidents. We will consolidate all the business -- the more -- almost all the businesses and the business portfolios under these 2 presidents. And given the fact that, that is happening and they will be putting in their own governance sectors in place, we felt that it is right to disband the Executive Council as of April 1 and the 2 presidents will create their own governance sectors.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Shibu, let me add. This is Narayana Murthy. As Shibu pointed out, we are a company in transformation. We have had several initiatives on the anvil to make this a better company. A few of them completed their conclusions earlier, and an important one, like having the organization restructuring having 2 presidents, took a little bit more time because it needed lot more deliberations. As a man in a hurry, I wanted to get on with the job and therefore, when the recommendations on expanding the Executive Council came up, I said, \"That's fine. Let's go ahead and do it.\" However, when the recommendations on the 2 presidents came, our review demonstrated that this new structure, with the kind of governance structure that they will put in place, as Mr. Shibulal pointed out, would render the Executive Council redundant. As an organization that is focusing on bringing efficiency in every one -- every dimension of our operations, we wanted to set an example at the highest level. And that's when we had to take the tough decision of disbanding the Executive Council. That's the reason why even though we had expanded the Executive Council a few months ago, perhaps a couple of months ago, we bit the bullet and said, \"We will do what is right by the organization.\"", "Operator", "Our next question is from Diviya Nagarajan of UBS.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On this offshore shift in cost efficiency initiatives that you have been putting in place, could you kind of give us a sense on how far along the way we are and could you also give us, if possible, a mix of the industry verticals or geographies that you've had the most cost efficiencies and offshore shift play through during the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So this is a journey which we have undertaken. Our belief is that we should add maximum value from offshore and that's the best way we can reduce the total cost of ownership for our clients and deliver the highest level of quality and scale. We have made some progress. We will continue to -- we will continue on this journey. And there are various factors which goes into it like customer comfort and solution maturity, new automation and productivity improvement. So as I said, this is a journey which we will continue to take. On the specific industry verticals, I don't think there is any secular difference. We have seen a shift in almost all of them. Some of them may be marginally higher but generally all of them have shown improvement.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And a question an attrition, if I may. On a quarter annualized basis, it's come down, but we have seen negative headcount addition this quarter. We have spoken about fresher hires starting next year, but on the lateral side, are you comfortable with the kind of additions that you're seeing here, and could you also give us a sense of where this attrition is the highest attrition, please?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So the attrition in absolute terms have actually come down from last quarter to this quarter. While in the annualized terms, it has gone up, and that is because when you -- it's a moving window. It does not reflect the current quarter in the sense it reflects the last 2 quarters. In absolute numbers, it has come down. Over the last 6 months, we have done multiple things to address -- to make sure that our employees are happy with us. We have given compensation increase. We have done promotions. We have changed the weight of our compensations. We have done enormous amount of communication to our employees over the last 6 months. We will continue to do this in the coming months, and the next cycle of promotions and other things are being looked at.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Yogesh Aggarwal of HSBC Securities.", "Yogesh Aggarwal - HSBC, Research Division", "I just have a couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, can you provide a bit of detail on large deals signed in the quarter, because like last quarter, you had 5 deals with 450 [ph] million TCV? So something on that. And secondly, the revenue per client has been consistently falling last 8 quarters, so is this -- has there been impact on client mining and the relationship with all the restructuring going on or is it just incidentally so just...", "S. D. Shibulal", "Can you please speak loudly?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Can you please speak up? We were not able to hear the question.", "S. D. Shibulal", "The first part of the question we heard. It's on large deals. Let me request B.G. to respond to that. And the second question, if could you kindly repeat.", "Yogesh Aggarwal - HSBC, Research Division", "Yes, so the second question was the revenue per client has been falling for the last 8 quarters consistently. So has there been an impact on client mining or satisfaction because of all the restructuring going on? If you could just elaborate on that.", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G. I'll take the first part of the question. The large deal pipeline continues to be pretty decent. We have not seen any major shift either way. We have had pretty good wins in the last quarter, about 3 in Europe, a couple of them in the U.S. There are 2 large deals within the financial services sector. One is related to testing consolidation. We are also seeing clients increasingly focus on app decommissioning. That's an area where we have also specialized. So the second deal win was more to do with app decommissioning. The U.S. wins, 2 were -- both were in the area of vendor consolidation. Again, we were very well positioned with respect to our solutions and hence, we were able to grab these 2 deals. Looking forward, again, the pipeline, as we go into quarter 4 and the next year, we continue to see momentum in large deal wins. There is primarily -- it's primarily driven by 2 distinct areas. One, clients continue to have increased focus on efficiencies and cost optimization. We are clearly seeing an integrated effort from our clients, both on IT as well our operations coming together, and in some of these deals, we are pretty well positioned. The other area where we continue to see activity within our clients, particularly in large initiatives, is one is on business transformation, the other is on internal simplification of processes. And here, again, we have specific solutions and our platforms, particularly the investments we have made, is coming to play, in differentiating our offerings in some of these deals.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the second part of the question, we are actively broad-basing our clients. Actually, if you look at this last year Q3 to this year Q3, we have added 112 new clients. As of last year Q3, we had 776 clients. And as of this Q3, we have 888 clients. So we are actually broad-basing our clients. Simultaneously, if you look at it this quarter, we have added 25 new clients to our $1 million club. As of last quarter, our $1 million clients were 469, and this quarter, it is 495. Most of the other parameters are somewhat stable. Our top 10 clients continue to give us -- some maybe doing 23% to 24%. This quarter, it's 23.5%. Top 5 U.S., 14.1%. So it is a reflection of our active strategy to broad-base our clients.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Viju George of JPMorgan.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My question is just a follow-up to the question that Anantha raised. If you find that this co-president structure is not working as optimally as you hoped, are open for a review? Is this a little bit of a trial by error kind of process that you try and see what structure works well for you going forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have just announced...", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Good, I will handle it [ph] .", "S. D. Shibulal", "We have just announced the president structure. We are consolidating the business portfolio under these 2 presidents. We clearly believe that this will allow us to create market velocity. This will allow us to drive growth. This will allow us to drive operational efficiency and productivity. This will allow us to drive customer centricity. And at the same time, while we have the portfolio dwells [ph] under B.G. and Pravin, B.G. will dominantly focus on global markets and Pravin will focus on global delivery and service innovation. We believe that these are -- this is a good structure to have. It will drive our objectives.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, thanks, Shibu. This is Narayana Murthy. Now we have had considerable deliberation. We have consulted all the senior stakeholders, and we have arrived at this conclusion that having 2 presidents, one focusing on the market and one focusing predominantly on the delivery effectiveness is a good one. Now we will study this. We will look at the results. We will give sufficient time for this structure to prove itself. And if it doesn't prove after giving sufficient time, certainly we'll change if it's required. Let me be very, very clear because at the end of the day, our priority is to make this a high-performance organization. And having studied several examples, we believe that this is a good structure. This will also create us an opportunity for the nominations committee to consider the internal cadre of people, along with the external candidates for the selection of the CEO when Mr. Shibulal retires in March 2015. Therefore, in some sense, it has not only created a good platform to make the organization more efficient, it also created a platform wherein it will be easier for the nominations committee to create a portfolio of candidates for selecting the new CEO. And number three, if for any reason we have -- and the nomination committee decides that there will be a new -- there will be a CEO from outside, then this is the structure that is least [indiscernible] to the stability of the organization. So looking at it from all aspects, we believe that this is a good structure because, one, it will make the organization more efficient, more effective; second, it will provide a better focus on the portfolio of internal candidates that the nominations committee may want to look at; and third, that it will review the possibility of instability should we have an external CEO.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Sure. Sir, if I may ask one more question, please. Over the past few months since you've taken over, there's been a string of high level of exits and, at the same time of course, of also maybe exits of talent at critical levels, though not high-profile enough to be covered by the media. At the same time, we don't see much evidence of Infosys hiring from outside as well. How would you assure the Street that this loss of talent may not hurt going forward?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, thank you. I think it's a good question. I'm glad you asked that. Infosys was the first Indian company, not just Indian, IT company -- it was the first Indian company to set up its Leadership Institute as early as 2000. At the Leadership Institute, our focus has been to develop a large number of leaders. We have a 3-tier program, Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3, and these 3 tiers, together, have developed approximately -- about 600 leaders. Now if you look at this room -- I mean, I'm able to look at, you will not because you are on the teleconference, I see a set of extraordinary people, most of them in their 40s. We have 2 presidents who have just crossed -- one is just below 50, other has just crossed 50. We have a large number of enthusiastic and energetic people who report to be people that I see in this room. So therefore, I think as far as the future of this organization is concerned, let me assure you that, that future will not be compromised because of lack of leadership. Insofar as the exits are concerned, let me make a cryptic statement, and that is it is good for them. It is good for the company. We wish them the best. These are people who have added considerable value to the organization, and it is good for the company because the company has a large number of enthusiastic and energetic people who are ready to take on bigger and bigger roles. Therefore, I think while we add value to the entire industry in India and abroad, when we contribute very well-trained leaders to outside,", "", "[Audio Gap]", "developed leaders who are enthusiastic and energetic. Therefore, this is not my worry.", "Viju K. George - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Sure, and one final question for my side, you have identified 3 levers or plans on which Infosys' revival would be with [indiscernible] , sales effectiveness, delivery effectiveness, delivery automation and the cost optimization. It seems to as that, at this point in time, it's the third mentioned lever that's working very, very well. What's the timeframe for the sales, engine firing and cost -- sorry, delivery optimization initiatives playing out?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Sure. So I don't know if you listened to my AGM lecture. When I spoke about these 3 initiatives, the sales effectiveness, the delivery effectiveness and customer optimization, I did say that they have -- very clearly that cost optimization is one and -- it's one of the initiatives that is likely to yield results earlier than the other 2. I think in my opinion, the second initiative that -- I mean, the cost optimization would, I say, yield result between -- somewhere between 6 months to 18 months. Insofar as sales effectiveness is concerned, I believe that it will bring us value anywhere between 9 months to 21 months. And insofar as the delivery effectiveness is concerned, I think it will take, perhaps, up to 3 years. When I talk about this effectiveness, I don't mean incremental changes. I mean for Infosys to become, once again, the leader in the industry, I believe that you are looking at the cost optimization taking anywhere between 6 and 18 months. We are looking at sales effectiveness taking anywhere between 9 and 21 months, and we are looking at delivery optimization -- delivery effectiveness optimization taking anywhere between 12 months to 36 months.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Bhuvnesh Singh of Barclays.", "Bhuvnesh Singh - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Sir, I -- this question is to Mr. Murthy. Sir, I just heard that how we take Infosys to, again, the leading light in Indian IT services industry. Now one part of that which we have seen over the last decade has been a focus on value addition to climb [ph] . And based on that, Infosys has always guided us to getting the top margins in the IT services space. So when you look at medium term, how do you think that Infosys margins would behave? And how is the changing environment changed our view on margin?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "So I think, as you know, we give our guidance once a year now, and we keep revising the guidance every quarter. Rajiv, correct me because I've been out of touch on this. So I don't think I can make any such forward-looking statements about the specific margin. I think that is not fair. All that I can say is this. The -- looking at the faces in this room, I see confident faces. I see joyful faces. I see kindred spirit. That's one. Second, I think we have been working on several initiatives. We saw work in progress in terms of innovation, both in the area of sales effectiveness and delivery effectiveness. I don't want to comment on these initiatives at this stage because they're all work in progress. They will take some time. But as I pointed out earlier, you will see -- hopefully, you will see the positive impact of these in the next -- as I said, anywhere from 1 year to 3 years. So that's what I will say. And in terms of margins, I think Rajiv will give margins as -- from quarter after quarter when we go to the relevant time. I don't think I would like to comment on that.", "Bhuvnesh Singh - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Rajiv, just one follow-up question to you, see, Bloomberg reports that you have said something about medium- to long-term operating margins of 25%. First, is that correct? And second, do you -- if that is correct, do you think that will be the top end and important [ph] in the industry?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. What I have said -- yes, I have stated that I expect operating margin in the medium to long term to be about 25% to 26%. And -- but at the same time, if we need to make investments, we would make investments [indiscernible] about the future for ourselves. So seen in -- if you look at the phase [ph] of the operating, there are a lot of technology changes happening. There are a lot of disruptions happening in the space. And that time, we have to make investments in the whole social mobility, [indiscernible] cloud space. So I think in the medium term, a 25% to 26% operating margin is a good margin for this business.", "Bhuvnesh Singh - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And that also holds for the industry, if I may ask, sir? You will be again at the top end of industry with this margin?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pankaj Kapoor of Standard Chartered Securities.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "Sir, I have, actually, 3 questions. First, just looking at the decline in the sales and marketing headcount cost and the concurrent decline in the sales and support headcount, I was wondering if, indeed, we are seeing some attrition on our front-end sales force, if you can comment on that, please. Second, on the offshore shift, can you give some indicator, like where do you expect this to settle down? Or what could be the optimal level that you are targeting? And finally, last quarter, you had highlighted that the portfolio reshuffle is one of the reasons for a weak revenue outlook for the second half. Now with this latest reorg of appointment of co-presidents, do you expect the impact could actually continue for a longer period, maybe, say, first half of FY '15?", "B. G. Srinivas", "I'll take the first part of the question, which was reference to the sales expenses, as well as investments. We will continue to -- as Mr. Murthy mentioned, continue to focus on increasing sales effectiveness. And in that context, we have relooked at, one, what are we looking at in terms of enhancing client focus. And in that context, we will continue to make investments into sales force, driving more and more talent, walking our client corridors and making an impact. We are also enhancing the sales training in terms of adding value to our clients. We will continue to increase headcount in business development, opening new accounts, and this will be across all geographies and the industry vertical segments. We are also looking at how to improve overall sales productivity and increasing the effectiveness and their initiatives in place. So in a nutshell, we will continue to increase our investment into sales. We want to continue to make sure that in the market, we have extensive coverage both within our existing client accounts, as well as opening new business. At the same time, every year we look at new geographies to expand our footprint. And in that context, we are looking at Canada, Latin America. We also increased our sales focus in the 2 large markets within Europe, namely France and Germany.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So on the onset of [indiscernible] , and this will be the journey which we will continue to take, our focus is always to have the highest developed value from offshore. That is what allows us to deliver higher -- a higher level of quality, higher scale and higher value to our clients. We will continue to focus on delivering more and more from offshore. And one was on business [indiscernible] .", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "And sir, on the reorg impact, do you expect that [indiscernible] ?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Right. So mind [ph] the organization is going through transformation. There may be some minor disruptions, but at the -- as you can see over the last 2 or 3 quarters, while all the transformation has happened, we have continued to focus on our clients. We have continued to focus on growth. We have continued to focus on margin improvements, and the numbers are showing them. Numbers are reflecting those areas of focus. So I do not expect some and continuing impact.", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G. Srinivas again. Just to add to what Shibu mentioned, you must realize at this stage, while it's a bit radical in terms of some specific initiatives, which we are driving on the delivery effectiveness and talent management, but by and large, in the market, these are less disruptive. They have -- these are leaders who are already focused on these verticals and markets. There has been a consolidation of business segments between me and Pravin Rao. And hence, from a market perspective, these are least disruptive. These leaders, business leaders, who are occupying positions, leading business industry vertical segments, have been in the market for many, many years, and they have been with Infosys. So from that context, there is not much of a change. Our client partners and then our business development market -- managers in the market, again, continue to focus on the respective verticals and service lines. Again, there is no disruption in that context. While there has been a change, it is evolutionary, and hence, we do not expect any major disruption. There will be, of course, realignment and planning in next level of government, which we'll establish in the next month or so. Beyond that, from April 1 onwards, we should be actually in a relatively stable position in terms of reorganizing and realigning our portfolio.", "Pankaj Kapoor - Standard Chartered PLC, Research Division", "And sir, if I can just maybe squeeze one small clarification. For our wage hike, are we reverting back to the cycle from April onwards? Or is that question still looked into?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Our desire is that we should get back to the April cycle. That's what Shibu, B.G., Pravin, Rajiv and I, we, are all working. And at this -- and of course, Tan, the head of HR. At this stage, it's still work in progress. It's still in a set of deliberation. So we cannot comment at this stage, but let me assure you that our desire is to get back to the old cycle.", "Operator", "Our next question is question is from Pinku Pappan of Nomura.", "Pinku Pappan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just as a follow-up to the earlier question, are there any headcounts cut from your sales force in this quarter versus last quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, there are normal attrition in the sales force. What you are seeing is not a secular trend. These are just quarterly fluctuations.", "Pinku Pappan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And what is the total [ph] ...", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "In fact, as B.G. pointed out, there is a big push on enhancing the headcount in sales force, and you will see that as we move forward. So I don't think that there is that there is going to -- there won't be reduction in sales force except, perhaps, based on performance.", "Pinku Pappan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. That is helpful. Could you talk about your win rates especially in this large deal, outsourcing -- large outsourcing deals in the recent past?", "B. G. Srinivas", "This is B.G. again. As mentioned earlier, definitely, our effort to improve conversions are -- that will result particularly in large deals. As you are aware, we have a strategic global sourcing team which brings in the competencies of the solutioning clients, employee transfers [indiscernible] specific cases, destructuring, solutioning and the overall competitiveness of the deal itself. In the last many quarters, there has been an increased focus of driving internal effort productivity improvements and increasing automation, which, in that context, helped us to compete particularly in large deals, where there is a significant focus on cost takeout. And that is something which is definitely yielding results. We have also made sure that we connect with the deal advisers and consultants, who pretty much advise most of our clients in this sector. We have frequent engagements, and we continue to articulate our value proposition in this area. So we should continue to see increased traction in both participating and winning large deals.", "Pinku Pappan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Margining [ph] on the same topic, could you quantify the TCV of delivery won in this quarter? I think there was a question asked earlier to what would be helpful to get a sense of the totalities that you won.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we have multiple wins this quarter. I think the total TCV won was close to $500 million. But please remember these deals are multiyear deals, and the realization in the first year is -- especially when you are in the second half, is very, very small in the first year. You, approximately, get about 20% of that in the next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ankur Rudra of Ambit Capital.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "So in the prepared remarks, sir, you mentioned that you had seen the prospects of demand as relatively exciting. However, you did mention, across business segments, that budgets are either flat or down. Can you help me reconcile that difference? And is it -- is your optimism based on greater acceptance of offshoring emerging now versus earlier periods?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So what I mentioned was that the external business environment has its own marginal improvement in most business segments. We have seen improvement. The marginal improvement in the quarter has declined in spending, but at the same time, clients are very much focused on cost optimization. They also remain very, very careful when it comes to making the spending decisions. Budgets are expected to be flat. While we are seeing variations in various verticals, overall, we are expecting the budgets to be flat. The current account optimization, it does give us opportunity to create solutions which can reduce their total cost of ownership, and that is an opportunity which we are focusing on.", "Ankur Rudra - Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd., Research Division", "If I could just squeeze a follow-through. Revenues in the U.S. were a bit soft this quarter. I was just wondering if this was exaggerated seasonality only in that geography. Or is this a focus impact of the offshore shift there, maybe the acceptance of greater offshore delivery's higher than that geography now?", "S. D. Shibulal", "I wouldn't say it's the secular trend. I think we need to wait a couple of more quarters. I don't expect a secular trend in that direction.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandip Agarwal of Edelweiss.", "Sandip Agarwal - Edelweiss Securities Ltd., Research Division", "So I think all of my questions are answered, only one final question. I don't know who would answer that best, but my question is, in 2004 or '05, when we used to get Infosys offer letter in hand, we used to simply throw away all the offer letters of the competition. When we will go -- get back to that position in the campus, what is the reason for that? And how that will be achieved?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, I think -- this is Narayana Murthy. I am so happy to hear -- you would say that at one point in time, you used to throw out the letters of offers from competition. That is our aspirational target. When you talk of aspirational target, it's very difficult to give a clear deadline by which we'll achieve those. But let me assure you that every hour of the working day, that we are all concerned -- the leaders in this room are all concerned about making Infosys, once again, the aspirational company that it was. We will leave no stone unturned to make sure that it happens, but I am not in a position to give by what date we will be able to achieve that objective, but there are lots of initiatives within the company that are all work in progress. And therefore, we cannot talk about it. And I hope they will all yield the results that both you and all of us in this room want.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sandeep Shah of CIMB.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "Just last one, I think, on the new organization structure...", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Could you speak a little bit louder?", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "Yes, just a last question in terms of the organization structure, so if we assume that either external or internal candidate has been selected as the CEO, one can assume that the number of president with the new structure will continue to remain 2, not higher than 2 or lesser than 2?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "What is it, number?", "Unknown Executive", "President.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Yes.", "Unknown Executive", "Will remain to be 2 or it might be higher.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Again, I don't think we should be close-minded on these issues. As long as we are progressing on a path of improvement, as long as the senior management of this company decides to take initiative that accelerates that improvement, I think that is the philosophy we should take. I don't know -- there could be 3 -- who knows, there could be 4. Who am I to say that it will only be 2. It's not that -- not the right statement. So all that we can tell you is we will bring about such changes, as well, enhance the energy and enthusiasm of this organization. We will bring on more and more leaders and give them -- I mean, and make sure that they get more and more responsibilities so that the organization becomes stronger and stronger. We don't want to set any limit on the number of presidents and -- or whatever structure. So we want -- we are very open to those things, and I'm sure you will appreciate our open-mindedness on that.", "Sandeep Shah - CIMB Research", "Just the last one, the revenue growth from a top line in this quarter has declined by 3.6%. So is it a quarterly aberration? Or is it more offshoring? Or is it more to do with the competitive intensity?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, I don't think there is any secular trend. There is the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and some of it could also be because of holidays and furloughs and other things.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference back to Ms. Gargi Ray for closing comments.", "Gargi Ray", "Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. We look forward to talking to you again. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter before taking up -- before opening up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to hand it over to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Thank you, Sandeep. Good morning, everyone. Let me take this opportunity to wish all of you a happy new year. We had a decent quarter, Q3, as we expected. Our revenues grew by 1.7% in reported terms and 1.2% in constant-currency basis. Our onsite volume declined by 3.4%, while offshore volume increased by 2.6%. Overall volume increased by 0.7% since our offshore referred mix went up by 1.3%. Our operating margin expanded by 1.5% sequentially, excluding the impact of the provision of visa-related matters that was made in Q2. We added 54 new clients. The number of $1 million clients went up by 26. The number of $1 million clients today stands at 495. Our growth was predominantly in non-U.S. geographies and Asian verticals.", "External business environment continues to improve gradually in most business segments. Clients are becoming more confident about spending and are willing to engage more on new initiatives. At the same time, they remain careful when it comes to making large spending decisions. Budget activity for our clients is moving on a timely basis. Overall, across the verticals, we see mixed trends regarding 2014 budgets. We expect the budgets to be flat across all verticals together. B.G. and Pravin will elaborate on verticals and budgets subsequently. Pricing continues to be stable. Our revenue productivity went up by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter this quarter. However, we continue to see pricing pressure on large deals and commoditized services.", "Infosys led -- continues its momentum with 14 wins this quarter, 8 in platforms and 6 in products. We continue to invest and see traction in the strategic areas: social, mobile, analytics, cloud.", "Across verticals, these technologies are opening up newer opportunities. While each of these is individually powerful, the true value to clients is when these technologies come together to drive their business agenda. A very relevant example is TradeEdge, an insight-driven sales platform that we launched in Q3, which clients are using to sense and fulfill consumer demand in emerging markets. In this platform, we use analytics capability to gain visibility across the distribution channel. We use mobile capability to empower the distributors, sales force to accelerate order intake. And lastly, this platform is delivered on the cloud to help the brands drive cost lower and accelerate rapid penetration of new markets.", "During the quarter, we are realigning our business portfolio to further enhance our focus on deepening client relationships, increasing market share, creating service differentiation through innovation and agility. We have appointed B.G. Srinivas and Pravin Rao as Presidents. B.G. will focus on global markets. Pravin will focus on global delivery and service innovation.", "We are going through a transformation. We had earlier expanded the executive council, so that the heads of the units and business functions can participate in executive council deliberations. And we are going through transformation, we have been exploring multiple ideas. Once the new Presidents were implemented, President sectors were implemented, we have -- once the new President sectors are implemented, it is appropriate to create governance sectors under their respective areas. Hence, the executive council was disbanded, effective April 2014.", "Based on our performance from Q1 to Q3 and what we expect for Q4, we have increased the revenue guidance to 11.5% to 12% in U.S. dollar terms. Now we will ask B.G. to talk about his business segments. B.G.?", "B. G. Srinivas", "Thank you, Shibu, and again, good morning, everyone. I will cover the following business segments, namely financial services, manufacturing, energy and telco.", "Firstly, on financial services, we continued to see clients focusing on cost takeout out of operations, and there is a clear direction of those savings into development of new products and services. In terms of focus areas, digital transformation, risk and compliance-related spending is the order of the day. There is a clear focus on modernization of infrastructure and legacy applications that are influencing some of the client spending as well.", "Pipeline is relatively healthy and comprises a good mix of large deals as well as platform deals. We are seeing a significant interest in our platform-based offerings in the last 3 quarters within the financial services sector. At the sector level, there is definitely pickup of lead momentum, and we continue to see this as we enter the next quarter. In insurance, again, we are seeing a mixed bag in terms of clients' IT budget outlay, while some of our clients have indicated their budgets are going to go up and some of the spending is going to go from nondiscretionary to discretionary as well. In other cases, there is -- the budgets are relatively flat, and in few cases, the clients are looking at a bit of a cut.", "Looking to the next sector, manufacturing, the overall business momentum remains stable. We are seeing improvements in automotive, commercial, aerospace and industrial manufacturing. There is definitely weakness in the high-tech sector, which is putting a lot of pressure on discretionary spend in this vertical.", "Information management, analytics and digital consumers are some of the key things that are creating transformation in our clients' business. Also, we do expect in manufacturing vertical, the budgets to remain flat overall. Within high tech, seeing a decline in budgets due to the impact of reduced PC sales, while in automotive, commercial aerospace and industrial manufacturing, we are clearly seeing the budgets rise.", "The telecom industry is continuing to have challenges. The wireline telco sector is severely under pressure for top line growth. The spend levels have muted as clients continue to see new challenges. And that is definitely keeping a check on both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend. Relatively, the wireless carriers, particularly in Europe, there is definitely time for investments and deal activity, and the pipeline is only seen [ph] in certain pockets in the sector.", "Energy sector is definitely doing relatively well. The IT spend will be marginally up for the coming fiscal. We are also seeing activities in all 3 services. This sector is heavily dependent on core ERP applications, namely SAP, and there are further opportunities in the area of consolidation and upgrades.", "I would now like to pause and hand over to Pravin Rao to cover his business portfolio. Over to you, Pravin.", "U. B. Pravin Rao", "Thanks, B.G. Good evening. In retail, CPG and logistics, we are seeing increasing spend in the areas of cloud, infrastructure, business intelligence, analytics and ERP-led transformation. We see an uptick in discretionary spend, though they remain in a stop-and-start mode. The deal pipeline has improved marginally over the last 3, 4 quarters.", "In the life sciences segment, we see headwinds in terms of patent cliffs. This, however, translates into opportunity in terms of large outsourcing deals. In resources and utilities vertical, we see a lot of focus on cost optimization and increasing spend in the areas of cloud, mobility and analytics. In addition, in global resources, we see companies focusing on simplifying their operations and improving supply chain efficiency. Budgets for the next year are down in the segment due to revenue challenges facing the clients.", "In the growth market unit, comprising of Australia, China, Japan and Southeast Asia and Middle East, we see different dynamics at play in the individual markets. There is focus on cost reduction and consolidation of spend in Australia. In China, clients are investing in ERP and analytics, after centralizing their operations. In Japan, demand is being driven by the need to simplify IT and drive revenue-generating spend. Overall, in the region, deal pipeline is decent, though the ticket size is small.", "In the services sector, the new age information services companies leveraging digital are increasing spend, while the traditional print media is cutting spend.", "In travel and hospitality segment, we have seen an uptick in spend, driven by economic stabilization and mild recovery in the U.S. We have almost 20 engagements in cloud and Big Data. Cloud is driving the IT organization towards more outcome-based, SLA-oriented constructs. Clients are also excited about the possibilities of contactability and open standards that would help eliminate vendor lock-in and maximize performance.", "In mobility, we have started over 25 engagements in quarter 3 in the areas of sales force automation, device management and enterprise productivity. Clients are also looking to establish mobile app factories to cater to their mobility requirements. We see good levels of interest for managed pay-per-use model here as well.", "I will now to pass on to Rajiv to elaborate on the financial performance.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Pravin, and a very good morning to all of you. I'll take you through the financial highlights. Our third quarter revenue was $2,100 million as against $2,066 million in the previous quarter. This is a growth of 1.7% in reported currency and 1.2% in constant currency terms. Our gross margin for the quarter improved by 80 basis points to 36.1%. Operating margin for the quarter improved by 150 basis points to 25%, mainly on account of initiatives to increase efficiency in our operations.", "Net margin for the quarter expanded to 22.1%, which was at 20.2% last quarter, excluding the visa-related matter. EPS for the quarter is at $0.81 as against $0.70 last quarter, excluding the visa-related matter, which is a growth of 11%. Our revenue per person improved by 2.2% sequentially both onsite and offshore, while our onsite referred mix has reduced by 1.3% to 29.9%. Utilization is marginally down, to 76.9% for the quarter.", "Our other income was higher by $36 million in this quarter, mainly on account of ForEx gain of $19 million in Q3 vis-\u00e0-vis the ForEx loss in the previous quarter of $14 million. As you will recollect, last quarter, we witnessed extreme volatility in the currency markets, which resulted in a loss of USD 14 million. During the quarter, on the average, rupee was at INR 62.03 as against INR 62.77, an appreciation of 1.2%. We have outstanding hedges of $1.049 billion as of December end.", "Effective tax rate for the quarter is at 27.9%. Our cash flows from operations is a healthy 95% of profit at $439 million. After paying dividend of $219 million during the quarter and CapEx of $122 million, our cash and cash equivalents, including available-for-sale assets and certificate of deposit are at INR 27,440 crore. We have increased FY '14 revenue guidance in dollar terms to 11.5% to 12%. This is based on what we achieved in the first 3 quarters and our expectations for the fourth quarter.", "Lastly, I would like to reiterate that while we have seen early results of our initiatives to increase efficiency, we continue to evaluate our business needs and make investments wherever necessary.", "Before I open the floor for questions, I would like to mention that we have Mr. Murthy, our Executive Chairman, with us to take questions from you. With that, we'll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "This is a question for Rajiv. Margins were up sequentially, can we get the pluses and minus in terms of -- minuses in terms of what drove the margin expansion during the quarter? And then as a follow-up, maybe talk a bit about attrition and what are the actions that the management is planning to bring down attrition in the near term?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Moshe, during the quarter, we had an RPP increase of 2.2% both onsite and offshore. And also, an onsite mix improvement by 1.3%, from 31.2% to 29.9%, which both contributed to a margin of 1.8%. At the same time, the rupee appreciated by 1.2%, which had a negative impact of 0.3% on the margin, giving us a net impact of 1.5%. There were also benefits from efficiency in our operations that we were talking about, initiatives that we have taken over the last 2 quarters. But a lot of that money has been flowed back in the business in terms of investment in tools for productivity and quality, for enhancing the delivery effectiveness. So though the margins have expanded [indiscernible] in the quarter, we continue to make investments in our business to ensure that we secure a good growth and a good future for ourselves.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And on the attrition side?", "Srikantan Moorthy", "This is Tan Moorthy. On the question on attrition, while in terms of the LTM numbers, the numbers are high. On an absolute basis, the numbers are dropping from Q1 to Q2 to this last quarter. However, given the attrition number, we're looking at several things to curb attrition. If you look at attrition as a function of utilization, compensation, developmental opportunities and engagement, we have taken several steps in the direction. For example, on the compensation part, we changed the variability part for our people so that it is much more of a component on the fixed salary that comes in. On the aspect of development, we have created revenues for people to be reskilled so that they can get into newer opportunities as we find them in the organization and as the opportunities comes through. On the engagement part, again, we have taken several steps to engage people on being in the organizations and working together to make a difference. So there are several steps that are being taken to curb attrition. And as the utilization goes up, we expect that the attrition will come down as well.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Moshe, this is Nagavara Murthy. It's nice to reconnect with you. I mean, you know our business pretty well. The reality is simply this, that the margins in our business depend on, one, of course, growth, because the fixed costs get absorbed better with growth. Second, it depends on the ratio of the effort onsite and effort offshore. And third, it also depends on the lower ratio, that is, how many people of a certain level we have to the people at next level to the people at next level, et cetera. So I think these -- as we continue to work towards better ratios in these 3 parameters that I talked about, we can indeed get better margins, but if we don't do a good job, then the margins will obviously get reduced.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Rajiv, I think on the earlier call, you might have mentioned that the operating margin guidance now is sort of in the 25% to 26% range subject to potential investment. That seems to be a little higher than in the past. Is that the correct interpretation here? And is it because your cost saving efforts are running ahead of schedule?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Our aspiration continues to have industry-leading growth and superior margins. Our aspiration hasn't changed. What you have seen in the last couple of quarters is that we needed to make investments in our business to get to growth. And as we speak, we continue to make those investments. So our margins have improved because a lot of initiatives that we took in the last couple of quarters in terms of cost optimization, quality, productivity, delivery efficiency, sales effectiveness. The cost optimization has started yielding early results, and that is the reason we have started seeing the margins being expanded. However, we have to make investments, and as and when we get an opportunity to make investments which will help us secure our future, we would do that. What I'm saying is that in the medium to long term, I see the margin stabilizing around 25% to 26% in the medium to long term, and that is the position which I've been saying for the last couple of quarters.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And I'd be curious if -- second question and last question. On the sales side, can you talk about has the sales force in the last year or 2 gotten bigger, gotten smaller, what's the turnover been? What's the profile? I know you pulled a lot of people back into India and so forth. Can you just give us an update on size? How you're compensating them? Where they're located? And what initial impact you're getting?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Our sales force is fully onsite and they are compensated as per the market compensation. We are investing into sales. We have added sales force last year. Right now, we are looking at adding another set of people into the sales force. We want to have a pyramid structure for our sales force and that means that we will add a lot more people at the lower level, at the lower grade than at the upper end of the pyramid structure. This quarter, you have seen some fluctuation, but that is a quarter-to-quarter fluctuation and there is no secular trend. We will continue to invest in the sales force, and we will continue to invest at the lower end of the pyramid so that our pyramid structure becomes more healthier, and the number of people in the market will continue to increase.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, first of all, let me -- let's make it very clear that no sales person who are efficient has been allowed to leave. Those that were not performing, some of them have left, some others on a performance improvement program, that's number one. Number two, the people that -- whatever the cost optimization we have done so far, is primarily in the area of marketing, where there are lots of senior people sitting outside India doing jobs that could have been done at lower-cost locations and therefore, that's what we have done. Third, in fact, there has -- there is an initiative to enhance the number of people that are in the market doing selling. And as Shibu pointed out, our desire is to add a considerable number of people at the lower end of the pyramid. Today, it's a diamond structure. We have too many senior people and very few junior people beating the pavement in the market. And we are bringing a change in that so that these senior people are indeed helped by the junior people who will beat the pavement. So that's the story about the sales people.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. So I have a strategic question for Chairman Murthy, and it's also great to have you back on these conference calls. So it appears Infosys has been moving towards reducing its onshore cost structure to some extent and also moving to derive more growth from application outsourcing, its traditional core business. My question is whether these types of moves run the risk in the long run of Infosys losing some ground competitively in terms of its onshore relationships with clients or potentially hurting your ability to be a leader on consulting deals? Are those long-run risks of the strategic moves that are being made today?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "No. Not really. I'll tell you what, we -- today, we have an onsite effort to offshore effort of 29.9% to 70.1%. We believe that we need to have people onsite who are in close touch with customers, people who bring value to the customers in terms of customer-heavy interactions, like requirement definition, presentation to the customer and then discussions on architecture, et cetera, et cetera. I think just having people who do programming, sitting onsite, I think, that's not a very smart thing. So therefore, our effort will be to have as many people as are required at customer site and people who will add value to the customer, people who will add value to the organization, while ensuring that all activities that can be done from lower-cost locations are indeed done at lower-cost locations. That's what the global delivery model is all about. That's what we have been doing for a long time. That has changed slightly, but we will ensure that the organization is robust, the organization in the future is robust, and we don't lose contact with our customers. But at the same time, we will bring better and better value, both to the customer and to the organization.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So does that imply that your assessment is Infosys and your main competitors, the, the other top Indian firms, does that imply that you feel they have more headcount onshore today than what is necessary to sufficiently serve the clients?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "I think you're in a better position to make that comment than me. All that I can say is what we at Infosys want to do, but I can't comment on what our competitors are doing.", "Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "But from an Infosys standpoint, you feel like you can serve clients onshore with fewer people, such as doing programming work onshore?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Sorry, no. I said activities like programming, detailed technical design, long-term warranty, these are activities that can be done very effectively from lower-cost locations. On the other hand, those activities that have customer-heavy interaction, they have to be necessarily done onsite. That's what global delivery model is all about and that's what we intend doing. B.G. wants to add something.", "B. G. Srinivas", "I also want to bring this in respect to the various services we offer, and that's really a distinction to be made. For example, our consulting-led business will continue to be focused and we are driving efficiencies even in those service lines. In the traditional business IT operations, the offshore ratios can be significantly increased. And hence, we need to make a distinction when we talk about service line specific ratios, both in terms of offshore-onsite ratios and lower ratios, and even at an organizational level continue to support our clients on transformation initiatives, support our clients in helping them optimize business processes. And the third element of our business, which is product platform, IP-led business we'll continue to stay focused. At a strategic level, there is no change in direction as far as Infosys 3.0 is concerned, but we are making decisions in each of the service lines to drive and optimize efficiencies and making sure, at the same time, we stay relevant to our clients' business, both with respect to the local capability and capacity we need and making sure that the rest of it can be delivered in different Centers of Excellence around the world. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "My first question here is also a strategy question. I believe when Infosys 3.0 was rolled out, a part of the point of the change in business strategy was to move away from some of the commoditized work. Now we see a new strategy out there where it seems like Infosys is getting back to its fundamentals. Could you help us reconcile what Infy 3.0 was, how your new strategy is different, and what was working and what wasn't, that you're changing?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, I think, first and foremost, Infosys 3.0 was all about increasing client relevance. And under that umbrella, we had launched -- we had broadly categorized 3 offerings: consulting system integration, business and IT operations, products and platform. There was never ever any intention of not growing any one of these offerings. We were very clear that we will have to grow all the 3 offerings to achieve our goal of industry-leading growth. Some of them, for example, the products and platform, would be on a lower base, which means that it will grow faster than our average. That is the strategy behind Infosys 3.0. Now if you look at the performance, if you look at our consulting system integration business, which is a transformational business, which in light of renewed [ph] productivity, has gone to 33.4% as of this quarter. If you look at the business and IT operations business, we have been very focused on winning large outsourcing deals. You remember, business and IT operations give us about 62% to 63% of our revenue. For us to achieve industry-leading growth, there is absolutely no way we can do it without winning large outsourcing deals in business and IT operations. So by creating that offering, what we were trying to do was to increase our ability to compete in the market; create better solutions, which are more relevant to our clients; create multi-tower solutions, which will bring in much more value to our clients; and to be price-competitive in the market. If you look at our performance in that space, performance have improved continuously. This quarter, we have closed about $500 million of TCV in that space. Last 2 quarters, we have closed about $1.5 billion TCV in that space. Please remember, large outsourcing deals are multi-year deals. They take about 5 to 7 years to realize the revenue. First year, the revenue realization is usually about 8% of the total deal closure of the year, and next year onwards, about 20%. That is the pattern which we have seen. So as I said, we are very focused on winning large outsourcing deals in the business and IT operations space. Lastly, on the products and platform space, this is about creating intellectual property, and either providing it to the client as a cloud-based offering or on a license-based offering. This quarter, we have 14 new wins in the products and platform space; 8 for platforms and 6 for product licenses. And for example, this quarter, we launched TradeEdge, which I talked about. So we will continue to focus on all the 3 offerings. We are very, very clear that for us to create industry-leading growth, we have to win in all of them. One is about transformational capability and helping our clients grow and transform their business. The second one is about operational capability. It is about reducing total cost of ownership, making sure that we win large outsourcing deals and with the BITS [ph]. And the third one is about products and platform, which is all about intellectual property-based offering and which will convert our clients' fixed cost to variable cost.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, I think, as Shibu said, there is nothing wrong with this strategy. Any company that aspires to be the industrial -- as I say, industry's leading player has to have all the 3 components. But somehow, we didn't do a good job in enhancing the contribution from large BITS, as we call, projects. And that said, we have Mr. Prasad, who will be leading SGS. So in short, that he adds considerable value to all our other segment heads. So the reality is that we must have much higher contribution from the strategic global sourcing initiative. And with Prasad taking that over and working with various segment heads, Sanjay, Mohit, Sandeep, Rajesh, Manish and Ravi and others, we believe that we will be in a position to focus much more on contributions from BITS, too.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "So I guess my question is -- so by -- it sounds like you're getting back to the basics at Infosys, is that correct, and you're maintaining -- you're still maintaining the 3.0 strategy?", "U. B. Pravin Rao", "Yes, I think so. The entire Indian software industry was founded on the principle of the global delivery model. And global delivery model was founded on the principle of globalization, which is all about sourcing capital from where it is cheapest, sourcing talent where it is best available, producing where it is most cost-effective, and selling where the markets are, without being constrained by national boundaries. And that's what globalization is about, that's what global delivery model is about, and that's how you make this a better world. And therefore, yes, I really do. I think getting back to basics is extremely important, without losing focus on modern trends, without focus -- without losing focus on modern -- on new opportunities. So that's what the company is doing, that's one of the reasons why...", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "The last question -- just a last question from me, though, is sticking with that train of thought, so I guess the basics brings back into question the amount of commoditization that's taking place, because the whole idea behind Infosys 3.0 is to get away from the commoditized business. By getting back to basics, don't you run the risk of running into more and more commoditization? Or how do you mitigate that factor when you return to the basics?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, I think that's a good question. While -- I mean, when Shibu was speaking, he spoke about our forays into transformational projects, which contributed somewhere around 33.2% or so. PPS, Products, Platforms and Solutions, is still in its infancy. Along with Finacle, it adds approximately about 6%. Therefore, the reality is that about 70% of our revenue has to come from large business IT services kind of projects. Now here, you are right, the reality is that the success in this is conditioned by the adage, the market determines the price, the company determines the cost. So therefore, we have started several initiatives on improving the profitability effectiveness of this company. They are all -- they're still work in progress. And as we move forward, as we see completion of some of these and as we see visible impact from some of these, I am sure you will realize that some of these initiatives are indeed in play. At this point in time, we cannot comment on some of those because they are still work in progress.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rahul Bhangare of William Blair.", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just discuss a bit about what drove some of the sequential weakness in North America? Was it just seasonal or something else that you can point to? And then conversely, what's driving some of the strength in Europe?", "B. G. Srinivas", "No, there is nothing secular about it. This is just a quarter-to-quarter variation. This quarter, Europe grew much faster than U.S., but I don't see anything secular.", "Rahul S. Bhangare - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then you've mentioned in the past that the large deals you've been signing have been price-sensitive. Can you give us a better sense for the margin profile of these engagements you've won over the last 12 months or so, maybe relative to corporate margins?", "Rajiv Bansal", "So I think, first and foremost, I should tell you that pricing is stable for us at this point in time, and so as the pricing went up by around 0.2% [ph] [indiscernible] went up by 0.7% this quarter. The large outsourcing deals are price-sensitive. And as Mr. Murthy said, though these are deals where market determines the price and we need to determine the cost, we are actively looking at various incentives, which will make sure that our cost is managed on these large outsourcing deals. At the same time, I also believe that it is about solutions, that we actually create a solution which is absolutely relevant to the client, which is the best in the industry, the client gets that most level of confidence and put a team in place, a team in front of them, which they will believe will deliver that solution in the most effective manner. I still believe that there is pricing power even on these deals. Then the other piece is, we also have to look at the lifetime profitability of the deals. These are deals that -- these are the large outsourcing deals are the ones where we will have to invest in the beginning on transition and maybe some other investments. But we also need to look at the profitability from the life of the deal. So when you look at these deals, when we look at these deals, the first and foremost thing for us to do is to create the best solution so that we can demand a premium. Second is to take a look at the lifetime profitability of the deal and see how, at the different stages of the deal, once the deal becomes stable, how can we drive efficiency and productivity through which we can achieve our margin.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I'd like to revisit a subject that's been asked earlier, but ask it in a different way, and that is, how would you respond to the comment that you're sacrificing growth, both near term and longer term, for profits? If I think about your sequential improvement in operating profit, it's fairly impressive, yet your growth in the quarter, I think, is going to be below other leaders such as TCS and Cognizant. And even if I assume that your growth implied for the next quarter, it seems like fairly weak growth. In addition, as mentioned previously, you're moving some of your labor from onsite to offshore, and yet as we reflect on what the opportunities are for the next wave of opportunities, Cognizant calls them the SMAC stack, that would seem to go contrary to that trend, because it would seem that winning those deals would require more onsite capabilities and expertise in the higher-end consulting areas. So the bottom line on the question is, when would you expect to emulate other industry-leading growth companies? Or would you expect to be below the growth levels of these other companies, as you call it, going back to basics, which seems to be more commodity type of work?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Well, I think we want to be very clear, first and foremost, our aspiration is to have industry-leading growth and industry-leading profitability. We have done it many times in the past. That's very important. We have done it many times in the past. And we'll still get the premium over many of our peers when we go in front of the client. That is one part of the answer. The second piece is, even last quarter, when I talked about Q3 and Q4, I had said that usually, Q3 and Q4 are soft quarters for us, especially Q3, because of the holidays and furloughs. And if you look at our guidance, because we had said it is a soft quarter, I believe that we have seen decent performance in Q3. Going forward, our objective will be to make sure that we achieve growth, industry-leading growth. At the same time, through the initiatives that we are doing internally, so the initiatives that we are doing internally, will drive operational efficiency, will drive cost optimization, will drive more offshore and achieve our margins. We have done this in the past. We clearly believe that we can do it in the future, and that is where we are.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Let's look at some data points here. Last year, we grew by 5.8%. This year, we have said that we expect to grow between 11.5% and 12%. That means we will be doubling the growth rate. That I think is pretty good. Though by absolute number, we are -- we'd certainly like it to be even higher. Second, as B.G. pointed out, there are areas where 100% of the effort is delivered onsite. For example, our consulting services, Lodestone, et cetera, 100% of the consulting service part is delivered onsite because we believe that is required. On the other hand, there are areas where we may need anywhere from 35% to 45% of effort being delivered onsite, that some of the IMS deals, et cetera, et cetera, that's where we are quite flexible. However, in areas like this, where an ideal ratio could be between 15 to 85 or 20 to 80, certainly, I think our aspiration is to move towards creating a very efficient global delivery model so that we have growth and we have margins.", "B. G. Srinivas", "One last comment on this. I just want to clarify, going back to basics would not mean that we'll drop the ball on consulting services nor PPS. All the 3 service lines will continue to be the focus area. We are making an increased effort to win large deals, drive automation, drive efficiencies, so that our ability to win large deals in the core business is enhanced. It does not mean that we will not focus our energies on consulting-led business and transformation business at all.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "But also, let's look at this, why don't you people look at the data on the contribution of the so-called consulting-led businesses to Infosys, total revenue, and that of other players? And you will notice that there's a much higher percentage for Infosys than our competitors. So there is no truth in the assertion that we are moving away from those. So that's something I want you people to look at it.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Actually, to continue on what Mr. Murthy said, and give you the numbers, I believe the industry average for consulting and system integration is approximately around 20%, and we are at 33.4%.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. If I could just ask a follow-up, then. A, how would you think about your growth relative to the industry for calendar year '14? And B, implicit with what you're demonstrating in terms of moving work from onsite to offshore, how are you thinking about the U.S. immigration issues? It would seem almost implicitly, that you're less concerned about that, but I just want to hear on those 2? A, how are you thinking about your growth relative to the industry in calendar year '14? What are your targets, what are your objectives, relative to the industry, if you don't want to give specifics? Then b, how are you thinking about the immigration bills versus your move to transition more work offshore versus onsite?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So as I said, our aspiration will be to have industry-leading growth and -- but I just want to go back to what Mr. Murthy said. Last year, we grew by 5.8%, and this year, our guidance right now is 12 point -- sorry, in constant currency terms, actually, it is 12.4% to 12.9%, which is more than double last year's growth rate. And again, as Mr. Murthy said, we still aspire for more. I think we would still aspire for more. Next year, I talked about the aspiration, but at the same time, it will be too early for us to discuss any specific numbers. In the end...", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "I think we will let you know on April 10.", "S. D. Shibulal", "On April 10, we will have the numbers.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes. I wasn't looking for specifics, just relative to the industry, particularly against Cognizant and TCS, if you would aspire to be at relatively consistent growth rates to whatever those companies demonstrate for calendar year '14, or is that too high of a target?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Yes. At this stage, we cannot comment. We will certainly talk about it on April 10.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then perhaps just finishing off on the immigration bill, then I'll cede the floor.", "S. D. Shibulal", "On the immigration bill, we have not seen any change in status from the beginning of the quarter to current -- as of today. We watch it very closely. There are clauses in the immigration bill which could impact our business, which we have acknowledged in the past. But as you know, immigration bill is a very complex process. You have to have 2 bills passed, 1 in Senate, 1 in the House, and then it has to go through the conference committee. So we don't know when and what stage it will get signed. We watch it closely, and we will -- as of when we need to react, we will come up with plans to react to it.", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, I personally believe that no company should stake its future on the immigration bill of any country. Therefore, there are several initiatives, which are still work in progress, therefore, we are not in a position to comment on it. That will ensure that this company will continue to be an important player in the global IT services market, no matter what happens to the immigration bill. That's our aspiration and that's what we will certainly do.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC", "A couple of questions. There's a lot of emphasis on cloud and Big Data, software-as-a-service, and definitely, that comes at the cost of traditional players. And when I look at your spreadsheet you sent out, we were under the impression like if the business is gravitating towards the newer ITs, the old IT business from SAP and Oracle should suffer, but we are not seeing any weakness in your package implementations. What is the reason for that?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I want to just go back a few years and then try to give you an analogy. When you -- when we started on the journey of package implementation in 1999 and then expanded to consulting and system integration, over the years, one could tend to believe that it will lead into the BITS business. And actually, in fact, it's true. It did cannibalize part of the business because once customers start implementing new packages, SAP or Oracle, or any other package, they stop building those applications, right? But they still continue to build applications which are very, very unique to them. Now there is a third data model where actually clients can get software-as-a-service or a platform-as-a-service, so that they don't have to build or buy the package. But this will be a gradual shift. And as an organization, we have to be relevant to our clients. We want to be in the forefront of the revolution, which the clients are looking for. While on the one hand, over a period of time, it cannibalizes part of the work available, not our revenue, work available in other parts of the industry, it will create its own opportunity. So what we are trying to do is to make sure that we are working with our clients, we are leveraging the new opportunities which are coming along. At the same time, because of our capability and capacity available in other parts of the business, we continue to win very large opportunities in both, in business and IT operations and in business transformation work.", "Trip Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC", "Now in mobile space, I think it's about 3 years, 4 years back, you had a very interesting initiative, I think it was called Flypp, F-L-Y-P, and I think it was an app store that companies like Dell and other guys who are in telco space, white-boxing it. What is the status of that? And do you think that's a sustainable strategy moving forward?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So those kinds of initiatives eventually merged into PPS. And today, PPS has 7 platforms and 7 products in the market. One of them, the Flypp intellectual property, was merged into -- so for example, if you look at the Airtel Money, that's a slight variation of the Flypp intellectual property. So finally, that property ended up in products and platform. Today, they have consolidated that into 7 products and 7 platforms.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ravi Menon of Centrum Broking.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking Private Limited, Research Division", "Shibu, as you are changing your strategies, focusing on the basics and winning large deals, how do you think you need to change your employee profile? I mean, what sort of talent are you lacking right now? Or what sort of reorg -- or rather, I'd say, how would you need to restructure your workforce?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, this is the first Indian company that realized the importance of education and research in creating a robust future for the company. And therefore, I think we believe that recruiting smart people, providing them good training, both in terms of classroom training and in terms of on-the-job training, and then giving them an opportunity to grow in the job and creating a very robust pyramid is the way to go. And that's exactly what we will do.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking Private Limited, Research Division", "But so do you think that your existing employee profile is sufficient to cater to your large deals? Or is there any specific skill set or skill sets that you think you need to completely get through lateral recruitment or through internal new training program?", "Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy", "Well, I think -- I mean, we believe that we have a cadre of well-trained professionals that can fully discharge our obligations to our customers as we seek higher and higher growth rates. I don't think that it will be an issue as far as this company is concerned.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Thank you, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference.

Thank you and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Inba. Good evening everyone and welcome to Infosys Q4 and FY14 earnings release. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining us today on this call is Executive Chairman, Mr. N. R. Narayana Murthy; CEO and MD, Mr. S.D. Shibulal; Presidents, Mr. B.G. Srinivas and Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some opening remarks on the performance of the Company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by outlook for the year ending March 31, 2015 subsequently we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Mr. S.D. Shibulal.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Good evening, everyone. Let me talk about our performance for FY14 and Q4, I will also provide a high level overview of what we are seeing with our clients and then talk about FY15. Our revenue growth doubled to 11.5% in FY14 over FY13. In FY13, we grew by 5.8%. In FY14, we grew by 11.5% in reported currency terms and 12.4% in constant currency terms. In spite of revenue decline that we saw in Q4, we achieved this 11.5% growth. Our guidance for the year was 11.5% to 12% which we provided in January. Our revenues were at the lower end of the guidance due to the challenges that we saw in retail, CPG and hi-tech verticals and some unexpected rundowns and cancellations which we saw in other business segments as well.", "As I said in constant currency terms our growth was 12.4% year-on-year. In rupee terms, we have achieved a major milestone. Our revenues for FY14 crossed INR 50,000 crores which is a growth of 24.2% year-on-year. We have reached another milestone, our cash and cash equivalents crossed INR 30,000 crores in rupee terms and 5 billion in dollar terms. We have improved our utilization significantly year-on-year. Utilization for consolidated IT services including trainees in FY14 was 72.3% compared to 67.0% in FY13, excluding trainees utilization was 76.4% in FY14 as against 70.7% in FY13.", "Client additions in FY14 was at an all-time high of 238, 238 was the gross addition, our net addition was 92. More importantly, our million dollar clients have gone up from 448 last year to 501 this year, which is more than 15% increase. During the year, we completed a civil settlement that concluded the investigation by the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Office and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security relating to I-9 paperwork errors and visa matters that were subject to the investigation. There were no criminal charges or court rulings against the Company. Further, there were no limitations on the Company\u2019s eligibility for federal contracts or access to U.S. visa programs as a result of the settlement. This year we have applied for adequate number of visas.", "Coming to Q4 operating margins were 25.5% which is an expansion of 0.5% sequentially. Our operating margins have now expanded for two consecutive quarters. Volume growth in Q4 was 0.4% while the revenue productivity declined by 0.8% on a blended basis quarter-on-quarter. Year-on-year, our volume growth was 10.5% and our revenue productivity improved by 1.2%.", "During the quarter our offshore referred mix went up by 0.5% to 70.6%. Our offshore referred mix has improved by 1.8% in the last two quarters due to our relentless focus on optimizing our operations. In Q4 we\u2019ve added 50 new clients. In Q4 we have added 11,000 employees gross, and as I said the number of million dollar clients have crossed 500.", "LTM attrition increased to 18.7% in Q4 compared to 18.1% in Q3. Q4 attrition comprises of voluntary attrition of 17.5% and involuntary attrition of 1.2%. High attrition continues to remain an area of concern for us. During Q4 we signed four large deals with DCB of $700 million, two wins were in Americas, two in Europe, one deal each was in financial services, manufacturing, retail and ECS vertical.", "Infosys Edge our products and platform endeavor, presently serves nearly 90 clients. They had seven wins in Q4, four in products and three in platforms. Finacle had seven wins and 11 go-lives in Q4. We continue to see positive results of our early and significant investments in emerging technologies. During the quarter we signed 20 deals in cloud and big data and 15 deals in mobility.", "Coming to market overview; cost reduction remains an important area of focus for our clients across all segments. Market opportunities are driven by vendor consolidation, rationalization of operations, and infrastructure modernization. Client appetite for discretionary spending continues to be limited with higher sales cycles. This is reflected in revenues from discretionary areas, declining sequentially in Q4.", "Overall deal pipeline has improved marginally in the last quarter. However, decision cycles have also lengthened due to business challenges. Clients are monitoring return on investment much more carefully today. Sizing remains stable in most areas except in large outsourcing deals and commoditized services. As I said, year-on-year our revenue production which has gone up by 1.2%.", "We have given compensation increases of around 6% to 7% for our offshore employees, and around 1% to 2% for our on-site employees effective April 1st. Through the second round of compensation increase in the last nine months, along with the motions that have been rolled out, we hope to able to reduce attrition in upcoming quarters.", "Based on recent business momentum, and our expectations of client spending in the upcoming quarters, we have given a guidance of 7% to 9% for FY15. Growth remains our top priority. We will do all necessary investments in our business to have a better growth trajectory.", "With this, let the request B.G. to give color on the market.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Thank you, Shibu. I shall give you update on a couple of key sectors, financial services, insurance, manufacturing, energy utilities and telco. A quick summary, financial services, we have added 12 new clients in the last quarter, coincidently, even in manufacturing we have added 12 new clients. And in energy utilities and telco we have added 14 new clients in the last quarter. A quick snapshot of what we\u2019re seeing in financial services.", " ", "Last quarter, we definitely had a bit of a challenge in -- we saw some weaknesses in the business momentum over the last three months in some of our top clients, both in the U.S. and Europe. We have seen instances of budget cuts translating to volume cuts and delays in approval of projects. At the same time, banks are looking at cutting spend both on the run the business and change the business segment.", "However, we see opportunities, both in Europe as well as in the U.S., in areas were clients are pushing for cost cutting which includes portfolio rationalization, legacy modernization of the infrastructure, cloud and information management, are some of the over-opting trends. Digital transformation analytics, big data are on the focus as far as discretion expending is concerned. Banks continue to drive strategic initiatives to provide omni-channel experience to the clients and that\u2019s an area again where Infosys is working closely in partnering with them.", "Risk and compliance continues to be top on the agenda for our clients in areas of anti-money laundering, fraud prevention and detection, regulatory reporting and we are bringing to bare our expertise in these areas in helping clients putting systems and processes to enable them to become compliant. There are also increased interests in some of our platforms namely, ProcureEdge, TalentEdge and BrandEdge. As regards to insurance, we are seeing an uptick in discretionary spend with life carriers looking to invest in new products and services to drive customer intimacy. There is a predominant focus in cost optimization programs through infrastructure transmission, automation and leveraging cloud-based offerings. Banks are also investing in social platforms, in mobility technologies to improve business and distribution channels. The Property & Casualty segment are putting an emphasis on driving revenues through agency channels, redefining their products and focusing on growing new products by cross-selling and up-selling to their existing client base.", "Switching over to manufacturing, the Q4 growth was partially impacted by cost reduction and breaks in spending by some of our hi-tech clients. The dynamic nature of the market has led to budget cuts and few clients after the initial budgets were prepared during the year. In contrast, some other specific sub-verticals in manufacturing I think we have seen increased activity levels in automotive and aerospace and the industrial manufacturing. The large deal pipeline in manufacturing has seen some improvement particularly focused on IT operations, trending particularly in the ERP led transformation areas, digital transformation analytics are opportunities we are seeing with the industrial goods manufacturing. Overall business momentum in manufacturing remains broadly stable and in specific areas particularly in automotive we are seeing manufacturers are planning to build 3D value chains to leverage the printing ammunition that is independent of the technology effect.", "Switching over to the next sector energy and telecom, even though we have had some sequential growth in Q4 which was robust, the overall client spend is still challenged due to revenue pressures which is keeping the lead on both discretionary and non-discretionary spend. Telco industry has seen some recent consolidation which may impact spending in particularly in those clients. Spending in Telco is focused on driving improvement towards customer experience. On the energy side, we are seeing margin pressures leading to some cuts in budgets with specific clients. However at the same time we are seeing these clients invest in simplification and making sure that their ERP led transformation is leveraging some of the optimization efforts and driving costs down.", "Energy and utility clients are investing in CRM, mobile workforce management and moving apps and infrastructure to the cloud. The communication service providers continue to fund innovation in digital, M2M and connect and TV. In addition, efficiencies in operations through OpEx reduction, infrastructure outsourcing and datacenter consolidation initiatives are becoming much more relevant. As Shibu did mention we have signed four large deals during the quarter. The pipeline has moved up sequentially quarter-on-quarter, marginally but definitely the positive trend. A quick update on Europe, a significant milestone crossed with the fiscal year ending \u2018014, Europe grossed 2 billion in revenues and 25% of our global revenues is now coming from Europe.", "With that I would like to pause and handover to Pravin Rao.", "Pravin Rao", "Thanks B.G. Let me talk about other business segments. Retail and CPG have seen deterioration in the last three months due to aggressive discounting by retailers during the holiday period which has pressurized their bottom-line. Additionally, their top-line has been challenged due to harsh winters in U.S. and slowing growth in emerging markets. We saw many programs being postponed or canceled which impacted our quarter four performance. As we look ahead, we see retail and CPG clients looking at cutting costs and investing in revenue generating initiatives only if there is a clear ROI. There is a pressure on productivity and cost leading to vendor consolidation and openness to new innovative models. On the positive side, technology is mainstream in this vertical and spend is increasing in cloud, infrastructure optimization, business intelligence and digital transformation.", "Life Sciences clients are facing challenges from reduced product differentiation which is putting pressure on the discretionary spend. Cost take out is a key focus area, clients are investing in compliance activities, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation, analytics and cloud. While the deal pipeline is good, we remain cautious due to cost sensitive environment which can create pressure on our existing contracts. In the resource and utilities vertical, even though there is high confidence amongst clients, they continue to demonstrate caution and scrutiny while making spending decisions. Cost savings and improving operational efficiencies are key priorities for our clients.", "There is focus on emerging technologies and standardization, in the global markets unit comprising of Australia, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Middle East dynamics vary across markets. In Australia there is focus on cost reduction through infrastructure consolidation along with investments and risk, compliance and client facing initiatives. In China clients are investing in ERP and analytics. In Japan demand is being driven by the need to simplify IT and drive revenue generating spending. In the services sector the new age information services companies are spending in analytics and mobility based solutions while the traditional publishing segment remains cost focused.", "Professional services market is also cost focused, travel and leisure sector have seen a mild improvement. Our early focus on cloud, big data and mobility is helping us to showcase our capabilities to more and more clients. Across advanced technologies we seek sustained business momentum with 20 new deals signed for cloud and big data offerings and 15 new deals signed for Infosys mobility offerings.", "I will now pass on to Rajiv to talk about financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Pravin. Good evening everyone. Our fourth quarter revenues were 2.092 billion as against 2.1 billion in the previous quarter, our gross margins for the quarter improved by 90 basis points to 37%. Operating margins for the quarter improved by 50 basis points to 25.5%. During the quarter the average USD INR rupee appreciated by 0.7% from 62.03 in Q3 to 61.62 in Q4 which negatively impacted our margins by 0.2%. Other income for the quarter was $139 million as against $117 million in the previous quarter. This included a ForEx gain of 30 million in Q4 as against a ForEx gain of 20 million in Q3.", "Yield on other income was at 9.45% during the quarter, we have outstanding hedges of 1.058 billion as of March 31, 2014. Effective tax rate for the quarter was at 27.6%, net profit for the quarter was at 487 million as against 463 million last quarter, net margins expanded to 23.3% compared to 22% in the previous quarter. EPS for the quarter was $0.85 as against $0.81 in the previous quarter.", "Our cash flow from operations continues to be strong at $593 million which is very healthy to 122% of Q4 net profit. Although cash and cash equivalent, including available for sale assets and certificate for deposits crossed $5 billion and stood at 5.048 billion. Collections were good, DSO improved from 65 days last quarter to 62 days this quarter. For FY14 revenues were at 8.249 billion as against 7.398 billion last year which is a growth of 11.5%. Our gross margins for the year was at 35.8% compared to 37.3% previous year.", "Operating margins at 24.24% as against 25.8% in the previous year. The operating margin for the year were impacted by 35 million of visa related matters charge that we took in the second quarter. Effective tax rate for the year is at 27.6. EPS for the year was at 3.06 compared to 3.02 last year which is a growth of 1.3%. We have increased the dividend payout ratio from up to 30% of post tax profit to up to 40% effective FY14 to enhance returns to our shareholders. This is reflected in the final dividend for FY14 which has been proposed by the Board at INR 43 which translates to approximately $0.72 at a USD INR exchange rate of 60. The higher payout ratio will negatively impact our FY15 EPS by about $0.025 due to lower non-operating income.", "Looking ahead, we have given a guidance of 7% to 9% in dollar terms for FY15, the increase in salaries, promotions that we\u2019ve rolled out for our employees effective 1st April and investment in new visas will impact our Q1 operating margins by 250 to 300 basis points. We remain focused on accelerating our growth next year, we\u2019ll continue to make all possible investments which are required to achieve that considering that I expect FY15 operating margins to be in line with FY14 operating margins.", "Thank you. With that I\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Moshe Katri from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Hey thanks and good evening. The first question is for Mr. Murthy if he\u2019s on the call. The Company has been running at very high attrition rates during the past few years and it seems that it\u2019s beginning to impact your ability to staff projects, and that goes back to your comments regarding a skill mismatch. Maybe you can give us some color and what management is doing to trying to try to bring down attrition rates at least in the near-term, and maybe we can get an update on that? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So Mr. Murthy is not here he had to leave for attending some urgent matter this is Shibu. So our attrition is 18.7% for Q4 which is slightly on the higher side. Out of 18.7%, 1.2% is involuntary attrition so it is 17.5 even that is differencing higher than our comfort level. If you look at the last one month we have done number of things. We have given two rounds of compensation increase 6% to 8% and 6% to 7%. We have restructured a variable compensation that is one of the big demands from our employees. We have given promotions. We have given large number of promotions. We have given a commitment to our employees that we will focus on promoting people inside rather than bringing people from the outside. We have invested in training and academy programs which will allow our people to move up. We have implemented a tech stream which will allow technology people to move up without moving into management. We have implemented a fast track program which will allow high performers to keep moving up. So we have done numerous things in fact this year we have rolled out the compensation increase, the promotions across the organization by March 31st, so we are hoping that all of this will have an impact and attrition will start coming down.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "So based on the exit interviews that you are having with people that are leaving what are they telling you in terms of the main reason for them exiting Infosys while your peers are actually able to maintain much better attrition rates?", "S. D. Shibulal", "One thing also I want to add before I hand over to Tan, we need to keep in mind that this is a industry with high demand for people and the industry is growing. We have -- there are some of the best people in our side. We invest heavily into training. Our people just after our training itself will be a good catch for any other organization, that\u2019s number one. Number two, one of the concerns of the employees would be growth. And so growth is something our employees look forward to. Now to answer your question specifically let me request Tan Moorthy.", "Tan Moorthy", "Shibu, thank you so, and Shibu addressed few of those. So let me just give you little more details on where is this attrition happening and what we\u2019re hitting from the people. The majority of the people that leave us are in the one to four year experience range. And so this is clearly like Shibu said, training plus the six months training combined with the one year experience here makes them very attractive that\u2019s one aspect. But the other reasons that we\u2019re getting from the exit interviews are typically two or three types; one is where there is a desire to continue higher education. They\u2019re going, clearly these are people that have high aspirations that we\u2019ve recruited from institutions, who\u2019ve gone through and done well in our training. They\u2019re now looking to enhance their qualification through a Masters Degree program, that\u2019s one set of people.", "The second set are -- and these are mostly the three to five year is where we see this reason that I\u2019m talking about now which is people who are now settling down, getting married, and they are finding that their spouses are working in a different location and therefore they would like to relocate and if we do not have an office in that location then they become a candidate for leaving the origination, that\u2019s the second.", "The third is career opportunity and career progression and that is equally important as well. And some of what we have done now primarily in terms of providing re-scaling capabilities for people to fulfill any demands that we have internally rather than looking outside. So an approach of providing our people the first opportunity to take up a new role or a new kind of an engagement before we open it for hiring something that we\u2019re doing to address that population of people who have a desire and an ambition to grow fast and of course things like the fast track program that we just announced will help, but these are the top three reasons that we\u2019re seeing from the exit interviews. Thank you.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "It\u2019s just a follow-up. You\u2019re talking about weak demand in U.S. healthcare and U.S. hi-tech and you talk about a declining appetite for discretionary spending, is that something that\u2019s been kind of occurring throughout the quarter that it gets worse towards the end of the quarters. I think a lot of investors are kind of confused about that given the commentary intra-quarter at Infosys. Did things get worse as you approached March or it\u2019s been kind of consistently weak across the quarter?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So there was a certain amount of shifting in certain sectors after we completed our Board meeting and investor calls in the beginning of last quarter. We finished and actually during the month of February-March, we saw gradual degradation, so first was for example the CPG industry while the holiday sales was good, they had discounted heavily and that has led to impact margins and further impact on discretionary spend. That showed up hi-tech industry started declining with sales which were not up to the mark and due to decline in PC sales as well as decline in capital spend. So it happened over a period of time but for us to assess the impact you can\u2019t assess the impact on a daily basis. Right, it takes time for us to assess the impact. It shows up over a period of time and during the quarter, we had seen the impact.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company", "Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi. I just wanted to build on that question, I mean do you expect 2014 to be better than 2013, and can you reconcile your commentary regarding discretionary spending and pricing and budget cuts versus what appears to be a better economic demand backdrop? Is that a temporary thing?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So one is, remember that our business is a momentum business. That means our growth is quarter-on-quarter. The impact of Q3 and Q4 will show up in the next year, because if Q4 was -- if we had grown Q4, theoretically, it is just a theoretical thing, by let\u2019s say 2% or 3%, that 3% would immediately get added to the next year growth. It\u2019s a very simple math. So the impact of Q3 and Q4 will show up in next year. We had low growth in Q3 and Q4, and that does impact our next year growth. That is one part. The second part is when we gave the commentary in March, I had said that many of the things which I talked about, we expect to continue into the beginning of the next financial year, which is the first half of this financial year. So we expect some of the impacts to continue, but more importantly the Q3-Q4 impact will show up next year.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. If we -- so what is the outlook for some of the areas of weakness, like retail, hi-tech, do you expect those areas to grow in \u201914, and if you were to exclude those specific areas of weakness, how do you look at overall growth for next year? Is it going to be better than it was in 2013 for the other verticals?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I have Sandeep here who will give you color on the retail side, and the manufacturing side, Sanjay is not here, he is here? B.G. will take that thing. But please remember, I needed to reemphasize again. Irrespective of the market the impact of a low growth Q3-Q4, is setting us up for a lower base to start with, right? So the climb is extremely steep. If you want to achieve a certain growth, so let us assume that we\u2019re trying to achieve, let\u2019s say we -- imagine achieving 12% or 13%, the climb will be very, very steep, right? So impact of that will be there next year. Our deal pipeline is marginally better now than what it was before, marginally better than what it was before. Now, let me hand it over to Sandeep for his part, and then B.G. for his part.", "Sandeep Dadlani", "Yes good morning, this is Sandeep Dadlani, Head of Retail CPG & Logistics. So if you look at what\u2019s happened in January and February, we had a bad earnings season for many retailers that they had come off a tough holiday season that they had been promoting and discounting heavily. They ran into some severe bad weather in America definitely, and in select other parts of the world. They had earnings growth slowdown or growth slowdown in some emerging market areas as well. And overall, some of the retailers also went through some serious credit card security breaches, which really diverted their core investments and initiatives and attention to other places.", "What that resulted in was, postponements, project cancellations, many projects that we have won did not ramp-up as we expected. But if you look at the latest commerce department numbers that were declared, I guess yesterday, in the U.S. you saw March having record sales. There was a lot of pent up demand through January and February. So the sun has come out as they say, and it is likely that retail will recover, the way things are going. If that happens and if the deals that have been postponed, the projects that have been postponed start ramping up, then we certainly will not expect to repeat a this kind of a quarter in the retail sector, retail CPG sector. That\u2019s for retail and CPG. I\u2019ll pass on to B.G. Srinivas for giving commentary on the manufacturing sector.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Thanks Sandeep. In the manufacturing sector, while last quarter, we definitely had challenges in the hi-tech where typically in the hi-tech sector we expect to see ramp-ups, the minute the budgets are capped and that was a surprise in few of our top clients that did not happen and hence the quarter was soft. However, if you look at the other sectors within manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, industrial goods, there has been increased deal activity and we are participating in several large deals as such. So overall the net impact of the weakness in the hi-tech will obviously have an over arching impact for the manufacturing budget is going to be offset with deal activities in other sub-verticals within manufacturing. And hence there is some recovery in terms of the growth rates for the full year, while we can\u2019t take away the impact which happened in Q4 for the full year. We hope to see more about what clients will do because their budgets have been cut in the hi-tech sector and hence there will be initiatives which will be more towards cost optimization and we\u2019re having dialogues with what we can do as a Company to help our clients take out cost, simplify their landscape and in that context decisions are made in Q2 and Q3 we should see deal momentum picking up say in hi-tech as well.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And then just the last one from me, are you seeing any cannibalization of your revenue in systems integration by the movement to the cloud? If so, how should we think about that as we progress throughout the year? And any structural any other structural changes in the demand backdrop that you could point out? Thanks.", "S. D. Shibulal", "We are not seeing any secular trend in demand cannibalization. Number one, it is way too early because the number of platforms available on the cloud is not many. Number two, we work on both sides of the cloud. On one side with the cloud we do what we call, over the cloud that is about enabling our clients to use a leveraged cloud mobility, social those kinds of phenomena\u2019s and that is what we call over the cloud and we\u2019re doing pretty well in that space. Pravin can give you color on that.", "On the other side we do what we call on the cloud, and that will be the platform business which we do. We have booked $700 million of revenue in platform, in not revenue in TCV terms $700 million. We have about seven platforms in the market. I do understand this question that eventually people start moving from either custom apps or implemented packages into a cloud-based environment, then you will see cannibalization but we are way too early in that cycle. And what we\u2019re seeing is truly marginal.", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here, just to add to what Shibu said, today while we\u2019re seeing fair amount of opportunities around cloud the ticket sizes are still small and I think it will be a while before they mature or start cannibalizing. Now some of the things we\u2019re seeing today are we\u2019re seeing emergence of hybrid cloud for the enterprise at the same time from application side we\u2019re seeing applications being bundled with infra components and move to cloud. And in some cases applications are consumed as a service such as SFDC. So we\u2019re also seeing end-user computing devices also moving to BYOD devices of different kinds. So in essence we are seeing fragmented ecosystem and that presents an opportunity for us and we have been very proactively trying to leverage such opportunities.", "For instance with one of the clients where we were running our BPO services we have proactively gone to the client and on the procurement side we have proactively gone to the client and said we can discuss on Ariba platform. So we said we will innovate the Ariba contract, we\u2019ll move the application to Amazon web services, and then we\u2019ll take over the entire stack, we\u2019ll run BPO on top it and offer a transaction-based pricing. So we do see such kind of opportunities but these are foreign few in between, we have built capabilities that we\u2019re happily going after client. But for a period of time I think this offering will mature and we may see some amount of cannibalization but it\u2019s some distance away.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi. Good evening. Things seem to be going pretty well in Europe. I was wondering if you could expand on that, is it the United Kingdom, is it the continent, where in the continent and sort of what verticals are embracing sort of new players. What are you seeing in Europe? Thank you.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Let me request B.G. to answer the question on Europe.", "B. G. Srinivas", "Yes, if you look at the last years we have had a good growth in Europe overall 17%. And for the first time we have crossed the $2 billion revenue mark in Europe which is a significant milestone. Last quarter the revenue percentage from Europe was 25%, we have added to that 17 new clients in Europe in the last quarter. By and large if you look at the activities in Europe specific to the countries where we have significant presence is UK, Germany, Switzerland, Benelux and Nordics. France continues to be a little slow while we have definitely seen some early signs of deal activity picking up in France as well. Giving a specific to verticals in UK we see, had two deals in financial services, telecom and utilities and retail.", "In the continent Germany and Switzerland there is significant activities in the manufacturing sector and Life Sciences. Nordics is definitely opening up, we have opened a few accounts in Sweden, Norway and in Finland. Benelux while the market is small again in financial services and telco we have business expanding in our existing client base. We have seen significant growth in Switzerland and Germany and I must also say that the Lodestone acquisition which we did the previous year is contributing to enhanced competitiveness and capability which is adding to new account openings as well as expansion of our services footprint in the continent. Overall, the CSI revenues from Europe is significantly higher as compared to the rest of Infosys, it\u2019s closer to 42% primarily led with SAP which is again a dominant, which has a dominant presence in the continent Europe.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "Shibu mentioned commoditized services seeing a price pressure, could you describe what you see as the commoditized services and what level of price pressure are you seeing? Thank you.", "B. G. Srinivas", "See given the context of what our clients are going through challenges on managing their profitability given the top-line growth is under pressure, in today\u2019s context the cost saving targets our clients have is not in the order of 10% to 20%, it\u2019s in the order of 30% to 50%. And in that context, if you\u2019re looking at traditional services, which is business idea operations, any new opportunity, any new deal construct is demanding at least 30% to 40% savings. And in that context the only way those kind of savings is possible in changing the operating model from traditional time and material to either outcome-based or transaction-based pricing, one. Number two, it also takes extreme level of automation and offshoring to drive that kind of a cost and it has to be operate in the managed services mode and that\u2019s where we are seeing some of our clients open to new operating models.", "We are actually proactively proposing even existing client businesses to switch over to new operating models thereby our ability to deliver that kind of a saving is possible and hence our ability to compete also is improving. We are seeing a higher degree of conversion in the large deals we are participating because of the initiatives we have taken on these, particularly these two aspects the big stream automation, reducing significantly the effort required to deliver. And number two, also increasing the offshore content of the effort in our solution.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "So, is that a revenue impact you are describing or is that also a margin impact?", "S. D. Shibulal", "There is definitely a revenue impact because the clients are looking for to deliver more with less, number one. Number two, there is margin pressure but at the same time when I talked about effort reduction then that will be offset, the margin pressure although it\u2019s not directly translating to the total cost because we are able to reduce the effort and thereby manage the margin better at the portfolio level.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "Last quick one, tax rate guidance for fiscal \u201915 please?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, even the tax for the next year would be almost similar to what we have seen in the current year. We don\u2019t expect much of a movement. It could move 50 basis points here and there but tax rate would typically be in the same range. This year if you look at our tax rate, our tax rate has been about 27.6% and it could be around 27% to 28% next year too.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen may we please request you to limit your questions to two per participant. Time permitting you may come back in the queue for a follow-up. Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Just a couple of questions, I wanted to follow-up on the pricing discussion you just had, wanted to get a sense, you have been price aggressive on the large deals for a while with the intent I think to improve your win rate and improve the TCV from sort of the 500 million quarterly rate, I know it was 700 million this quarter perhaps somewhere closer to a 1 billion per quarter. Has your pricing aggression changed in the last three to six months? And related to the TCV, is there a TCV quarterly that we can kind of equate to Infosys getting back to sort of industry growth rates from a top-line perspective?", "S. D. Shibulal", "See, there are two aspects to it on the Infosys\u2019 ability to compete in the large deals, definitely there has been a significant improvement in our ability to compete because of the measures we have taken in the solutioning of the deals as such that is for sure. But the TCV does not necessarily directly convert to revenue in the same year of the deal which closes every quarter as we add to the deal pipeline and we convert typically we see about 7% to 8% of revenues accruing in that year. Remember there is also a period of transitioning of service which happens in the early part of the delivery of the solution and hence we see in the subsequent year typically we have seen an average of 20% of revenue realized from the TCV if it is a typically a five year deal that is how we would have a lead indicator of the potential revenues depending on the quantum of TCV signed assuming that each of these deals are in the range of three to five years.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then different direction maybe for Rajiv, sort of thinking about fiscal \u201915 margins and I know you sort of suggested they would be directionally aligned with fiscal \u201914 but maybe you can help us think through the margin levers to kind offset the wage inflation and investments that you\u2019re continuing to do with more specifics on the potential for utilization increases given sort of the volume growth parameters you\u2019ve outlined, also the improvement, what more potential is there on the onsite offshore efforts mix? And then should we be thinking about any cost save improvement that sort of factors into the margins this year?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes, so if you look at, if you look at the margin over the last seven to eight quarters, in first quarter of FY13 our margins were of 27% plus and we ended the FY13 at about 23.5%, which was a drop, in spite of a rupee depreciating by a big number. And this year if you look at the strategy of 22.5% operating margin, we\u2019ve ended the year at 25.5, so we\u2019re on the right trajectory. We are showing margin improvement in spite of giving the HI promotions, and giving the variable component of employees, and giving variable payout for employees. So we are making the investments into our businesses.", "Now what I said for the next year is that given that we have given a guidance of 7% to 9% and the growth being the most important thing for us we need to accelerate our growth, we have to ensure that we don\u2019t miss any opportunity in the marketplace to accelerate our growth. We would have to continue to make investments. Our attrition is still at 18.7% so we have to make investments in our employees. Considering all the investment needs that we have, I feel that the margins in FY15 would be in line with FY14, the margin levers that I have definitely, utilization is still at about 76%, I would like the margin, the utilization to be about 80%-82% so that is one lever that you have, but at the same time you would want to ensure that you have all the kind of people, all the people available with you to capitalize on the opportunity which comes in the marketplace.", "As you know it takes about four to six months to hire people and train them and keep them ready, so you cannot just do just in time hiring if there\u2019s an opportunity in the marketplace. So we\u2019ve given a guidance of 7 to 9, based on a 7% to 9% guidance I would expect the operating margins to be around in line with what we have seen in FY14 full year. However, we have to invest into the business in terms of capitalizing on any additional opportunity which comes in the marketplace, investing in the sales engine, in investing in employees, investing in new technologies and that\u2019s the reason I feel that in spite of utilization being one of the levers available for margin, I would be more comfortable with about 24% in that range for the next year.", "Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman of BMO. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you. I want to start with a question also on growth. For the past year in change Infosys has been growing slower than the industry average and certainly slower than peer group leaders of TCS and Cognizant, and it looks like in Q4 we\u2019ll know more tomorrow but the growth gap has widened. Why does that growth gap persist and how do you think about that as you look out over the next few quarters, you said that growth is one of the most if not the most important metric but it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re coming to growth that\u2019s closer to the industry? So if you could just please discuss that and then I have a follow-up please.", "S. D. Shibulal", "So, as I said, our growth is a momentum based growth, that means quarter-on-quarter we have to grow and one quarter actually will set the tone for the next quarters. What has happened is multifold, number one if you look at year-on-year we have doubled our growth rate. Our growth rate last year was 5.8% this year we grew 12.4% in constant currency terms that means we have literally doubled our growth rate. We also bridged the gap, last year we had a gap of approximately 10% of the industry average this year that will be about 2.5% or 3%, so we have literally bridged the gap.", "Now next year, when we look at the growth, unfortunately we had an issue in Q4 which we talked about and that has led to a slightly negative growth in Q4 but that is not the problem, the bigger problem is that it has set us on a lower base, so our growth trajectory, the slope is much higher for next year, that is the reason we have given a 7% to 9% growth even to achieve a 9% growth we have to grow quarter-on-quarter, what is it Rajiv? No next four quarters. 3%...", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "I think it\u2019s 2% to 3%.", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, on current and for the first quarter but other quarters there is steep growth which we need to do, and that is happening because the Q4 was a weaker quarter for us. As I said we are completely focused on growth, we are winning larger and larger deals. We are investing in the market. We have increased our number of million dollar clients, so we are completely focused on growth, but it will take some time, we have bridged this year, we bridged our gap, unfortunately we had an issue in Q4, we have given a guidance, we are fully prepared to take advantage of any growth opportunities which will come out of it, so that is where we are.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "S. D. Shibulal", "And so as compared -- when you compare it with the industry I think it is very important to realize that our profile is very different, you can just look at the numbers, the Indian industry average of consulting and system integration based on my knowledge is 19%. We are at 34%. If you take out our 34% the industry average will further fall which means average dependency on the discretionary spend is double that of the industry.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Alright.", "S. D. Shibulal", "When you have such a large dependency on discretionary spend the volatility is going to be higher. If you look at some of our peers who have a much larger dependency on consulting system integration work who are not Indian peers you can see this so our profile is different. We are trying to counter that by winning more and more large deals in our operations base it will take time.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, yes, fair enough. And that was actually going to be my follow-up question and I want to pursue that if I could. In terms of your headcount mix your onsite effort and billable hours actually declined or is growing slower depending on how you look at it but your effort person months actually declined onsite. And as I think about how you\u2019re looking at 2015 particularly against the consulting business I would think that that would be more onsite work. So how are you thinking about your headcount growth over the next 12 months particularly some of those larger deals that you and others are chasing as I would think require more local presence to win and execute against those deals. How are you thinking about investing on onsite versus offshore as you look at the next 12 months what do you think you need to do?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think we look at it as a portfolio there are certain service lines where we can optimize our onsite mix heavily going forward. So for example BPO runs at probably 1% or 2%, infrastructure runs at probably 20% this is a portfolio so what we are doing is to try and look at areas where we can optimize, reduce onsite as much as possible this is good for the client, good for us it reduces the total cost of ownership, it makes us more competitive in the market, it reduces, it gives value to the clients, win - win for everyone. And that is one thing we are looking at. We are looking at of course automation and things like that to improve our productivity. So we are looking at it as a portfolio. At the same time we understand that consulting is a 100% onsite business we are not going to offshore Lodestone. It continues to be an onsite centric business. So at the end of the day this is a portfolio some will run 100% onsite, some will run 5% offshore -- onsite and that is a portfolio we are trying to build.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, alright. Well, let\u2019s just ask one last one that relate to that, do you have a target for attrition that you\u2019re shooting for by year-end?", "S. D. Shibulal", "No, we have no target for attrition which we are shooting for in fact attrition is not a target at all so our objective is to try and -- and reduce attrition as much as possible other than the involuntary attrition. But one needs to remember that the talent demand in this industry is extremely high. Number one, number two, we have the best trained talent, full stop. Because if you look at our Mysore campus you can understand we are the only one who has the capacity to train 14,000 people residential for six to eight months. So, the amount is extremely high. We have the best trained talent. You are bound to have attrition because the cost of acquisition for -- of that talent is much lower than the investment in creating that talent. So that is what we are faced with and we will continue to have -- we will continue to try and actually we are trying to better our talent and we are trying to train them more that\u2019s what we are doing. So that means our talent will continue to be in demand. We are doing everything as to make sure that attrition goes down.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. We will take our last question from David Grossman of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered here, but I just have two. Shibu you\u2019ve given some good color on the loss of momentum in the March quarter that said you did see a reduction in clients over $100 million in revenue despite the quarters\u2019 win. So perhaps you could help us understand that dynamic and how much of that represents a growth headwind? And as a percentage of revenue in particular how much of a headwind is that to growth next year?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So I think I wouldn\u2019t think that there is any secular trend in those matters because these are all marginal things right, if the $100 million clients become 99.98 one of our clients moved out from 100 to 98.11 just simply a mathematical thing so I don\u2019t think we should worry too much about those factors. We have not lost a single client. Our $100 million continues to be in that boundary only plus or minus $2 million or $3 million and that is over a full quarter period so if the client that taking it -- one project has come to end in some quarter in the last year you will see these kinds of shifts. But the more important thing to remember is we have added 92 new clients during the year and increased our $1 million clients by 15% from 448 to 501 that is what we need to think about.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, I guess what I was asking Shibu is whether in fact the loss of momentum within certain large clients is creating a particular revenue headwind for fiscal \u201915?", "S. D. Shibulal", "Yes, it is. Yes it is.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "And could you help us understand the magnitude of that headwind?", "S. D. Shibulal", "That is very difficult to segregate because it is all factored into the guidance as well as our performance. The larger clients we have are in our hi-tech and in retail and in these places when there is a headwind there it impacts multiple clients and that will impact our growth momentum.", "David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus", "I see. Okay. And then just second question is really I guess more of a strategic question I think I have a high level understanding of the issues impacting growth. But I guess where I am less clear is what this business looks like when the transformation is further down the road and in particular are you going to be the low cost producer, are you going to have a bias to higher end services and products so in other words when the multiyear transformation effort is well down the road how does this business model look and how is it differentiated from your peers?", "S. D. Shibulal", "So we are trying to create a balance let\u2019s be very clear strategically when we look at the future for us to be relevant in the marketplace we have to operate in all of them, all three areas we cannot make any choices. We cannot make a choice that we will be the low cost provider neither then can we make a choice that we will only do the high-end work either way if you make such a choice the other space will be left alone and the competition will lock up by that space and then they will eat you into that -- then they will come into the other areas where you are there.", "More importantly as a strategic partner to our clients, we cannot make any such choices so when the transformation is complete further down some time in the future what we are trying to achieve is a balanced portfolio where we will be a partner for our client who will drive efficiency and productivity in their operations continuously giving us maybe 30% to 40% of our revenue another 35% of our -- 35% or 40% of revenue coming from the consulting system integration work which also includes some of the advanced technology work which we do and having a strong presence in the products and platform space because the clients will go there. So basically what we are trying to do is to create a balanced portfolio based on the balance the client is trying to build.", "If you look at the clients today, majority of them tell us that they are spending 60% of their revenue in lights on work and that is what is reflected in our revenue. Clients are trying to push it down to 40% and then take that extra money and invest into either transformation or innovation. So, we are trying to align our strategic relationship with our clients\u2019 priorities and when I look at it this is a forward-looking statement but when I look at it way down the future our revenues will reflect our clients\u2019 spend pattern which is operations, transformation and innovation, and somewhere between one-third, one-third, one-third is what we have said but otherwise it is somewhere between 40-40-20 similar numbers.", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constrains that was our last question.

Hello everyone. I\u2019m Sandeep from the Investor Relations Team in Bangalore. Welcome to the Infosys call to discuss future strategic roadmap, along with the Q2 FY\u201915 earnings release.", "Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal, along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the strategy of the company by Dr. Sikka, followed by comments on the performance of the company. Subsequently we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything which we say, which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Vishal Sikka", "Thank you Sandeep. Good day everyone. Before we get into the results of this quarter, I would like to take a few minutes to give you my perspective on the road ahead for Infosys.", "I started my journey as the CEO of Infosys about 70 days ago, and each day has been a tremendous experience, simultaneously exhilarating and humbling, but also challenging and yet a familiar one.", "Infosys is an iconic company. Our company has been instrumental in putting India on the technology map, in pioneering the global delivery model, which transformed the industry and for being the engines that train the top talent in the industry, and all of this while maintaining the utmost standards of honesty and integrity which others have measured themselves by.", "As we look ahead to the next 33 years of Infosys, we not only aspire to achieve constant profitable growth as Mr. Moorthy used to say, but indeed get back to being the bellwether company for our industry, leading it in both growth and profitability. And we want to do that on the basis of innovation, on the basis of technology, especially automation and artificial intelligence technologies and on the basis of amazing people who are amplified by technology, by the knowledge, the imagination and the conviction and the community and the ecosystem they bring with them in Infosys. We believe that this will result in a much higher productivity and a deeper relevance of each individual.", "I believe that this is a human revolution. We want to bring about this revolution on a foundation of learning and on the basis of excellence with the most modern technologies such as the latest platforms and architectures and the most advanced capabilities in AI and automation and we have already started down this path.", "Artificial Intelligence as a domain is often misunderstood. It is often associated with the precipitation on the acceleration of human irrelevance. Having studied AI at Stanford and at Syracuse before that, and at the feet of the pioneers in AI, I happened to see this differently.", "This pessimistic description is not correct. Technology for centuries has always been about the amplification of us, the amplification of the human; not making them irrelevant, and AI and automation is no exception to this.", "So we see an opportunity to launch a great human revolution, where we are able to achieve much higher productivity levels, to bring much more innovation, where we are able to paraphrase Prof. Mashelkar, \u2018Do More With Less For More.\u2019 I refer to this as the next generation of services and we are building Infosys into such a next generation services company.", "Over the last 70 days I have interacted with dozens of partners, 100s of clients and tens of thousands of employees and it is very clear that the world around us is being profoundly reshaped by software and by software driven technologies.", "As a result of this and to best serve this transformation and to best achieve a relevance in the world of the future, we see every business adopting a dual strategy. On the one hand to renew their existing systems and existing landscapes and their existing businesses and at the same time complement this renewal with entering into new business areas, new business models and build completely new solutions for these, often in areas where there was never software for those before. And this duality of renew and new also applies to us at Infosys equally well. We must bring this duel opportunity to life and we must do so within the underlying fabric of our culture.", "When we think about the renew portion of this equation I believe that everyone, every company in every industry has a need to renew and rethink their existing systems and processes, to enable these systems and processes for new kinds of access, mobility, analytics and big data, sensors and adaptive behavior, as well as move this systems to the could for achieving better scalability, better economics, better elasticity.", "And for Infosys, this means a renewal of our existing business lines, whether it is consulting of BPO, whether it is application development and maintenance or infrastructure management, whether it is implementation and integrating package systems or building completely new engineered solutions, whether it is verification or implementations, everything.", "And for Infosys it also means IP excellence with our Finacle and Edge products and an investment in assembling and building platforms and tools using existing technologies, using open source technologies, using propriety technologies from our partners, as well as our own IP. But each company needs to achieve this renewal through an improvement in their own operational efficiency and productivity and for Infosys this means an investment in automation and innovation and in our own operational efficiency.", "And similarly on the new side of this equation, we see a need for every business to find new software driven ways of connecting their ecosystem and their entire value chain, and new ways to create engagement with customers and understanding of customers to explore new markets and new business models and to build systems for these that have never existed before, in new ways on new kind of technology platforms and for Infosys this new dimension means working on our information platform, working on elevating our client conversations and helping our clients find and execute against their needs of the future.", "It also means offering new kinds of services using approaches like design thinking and co-creation. It means entering into new strategic partnerships, as well as work with startups and new kinds of companies to help us fill the gaps in our own value chain and this entire renew and new has to be done on a foundation of culture of engagement and of purposeful work. At Infosys we will double down on learning and education for all of us and indeed engage in life long learning.", "Let me drill down into the renewal of our services and offering the new services in a little bit more detail. Taking a service line view, in consulting services we will leverage the glue of our platforms, our integrated services and a deep business expertise to bring the best end to end solutions to our clients and further we will apply the power of design thinking to define the future systems and solutions for our clients.", "In business process outsoaring and business process management, we will invest in the advanced application of automation and artificial inelegance, and a deep focus on process improvement, on process innovation and help accelerate our clients move to best practices across domains, as they are most trusted and reliable business partner.", "In product engineering this is a key focus for us, we will bring our unique and complementary competency in the mechanical and electronic domains, where we design the great products of the world from airplanes and airplane parts to security systems. From drills to cars, from oil fields to routers and seek to relieve the massive value that lies at the intersection of the physical and digital world.", "And once we have done the design of these kids of products. We will focus on capabilities like predictive maintenance, machine learning and intelligent and adaptive systems across industry verticals, to derive a new value across this chain from the design to the deployment of products and in doing so we will also improve the way that we bring these products to life in software, by bringing together techniques in CAD, in product design together with the software design and development experience.", "In application development, our aspiration is to rethink the development experience to improve developer productivity dramatically. We are working on the Infosys development platform that will consolidate tooling and experience and build around rapid, agile, techniques, integration of development and operations, design thinking methodology and in brining AI capabilities and new abstractions into the development and offering experience, which to a large degree has not changed over the last several decades.", "In application management and testing, we will invest in areas like automated source code analysis, automated upgrades, automated regression testing, etc\u2026 and infrastructure management, we are adopting an open plus differed approach with reference architectures, put together with our partners in infrastructure that can help us simplify the complex landscapes of our clients, as well as doing a massive embrace of artificial inelegance and automation techniques to help bring a dramatic efficiency improvement in the way infrastructure of enterprise clients is managed. We have already embarked on this journey with partnership with infrastructure players, as well as tooling companies and we will do more.", "On the product side, we are building the best-in-class core banking platform with Finacle and our focus will be to enhance the end user experience of the products and to create an ecosystem of extensions in areas like analytics, mobile banking, digital commerce and inclusive banking.", "We are seeing rapid traction with our Edge suite of products in major companies around the world, across industries, in helping achieve a dramatic new economics and ease of experience in the frontline areas that are critical to enterprises. This will continue to be an important offering from Infosys and we look forward to growing this business significantly in the coming years.", "With big data in analytics, we are proposing an Infosys Information Platform, an enterprise big data platform that combines open source software with partner technology tools, as well as our own, and we want to bring this to life at our client at a cost that is a fraction of the previous generation approaches towards these areas.", "And Infosys can enable startup companies to attain dramatic improvements in engineering speed, in scale and achieve a global reach by helping them amplify and accelerate their development as they grow and helping them achieve their engineering goals, as well as their operational goals much more efficiently and in an accelerated way.", "We will combine this extension of the engineering of startups, we\u2019ll join go-to-market with them, as well as strategic venture investments, to bring Infosys into close collaboration with today\u2019s small companies, cutting Edge companies that will be great companies of the future. And to support of these service line innovations, our strategy will be to renew and rethink our own existing systems and processes; our processes for sales and marketing, for people and talent, for IT systems and for operations and administration.", "We would focus our people agenda on the experience of our employees, on trust through empowerment and accountability, on continuous employability and on life long learning. We are aspiring to create a transparent and a meritocratic culture that empowers every single employee to do their best for our clients with an unwavering commitment to our values. We will be employee centric and are working on bringing advanced technology to a deep and wide engagement with our entire workforce, using new cloud sourcing solutions.", "We will offer a unique combination of career mobility, learning and technological challenges to retain our top talent and we will renew our workforce through diversity of every sort globally and on minimizing our distance to customer value. Often in large organizations we see an endemic where middle tiers in the organization loose their distance to this value and we are striving to minimize that as we renew ourselves.", "We will also embark on an active inorganic strategy, focus on acquiring core capabilities, not on acquiring yesterday\u2019s revenue and yesterday\u2019s technology, but in achieving efficiency in acceleration of a road map towards the future, with automatic technologies, with new thinking in collaboration and advanced new areas, as well as to expand in under penetrated and high growth markets and in new geographies that are strategic to us.", "In doing all of this we believe that we will greatly improve our competitiveness in the market, especially to win large transformational projects and to expand our relationships with each of our clients and achieve a disproportionate growth in emerging markets.", "We believe that we will better position ourselves to lead our clients into their future with relevant innovation in offering in new areas and we will increase operational excellence, so that we are able to confidently invest for growth.", "We have already started down this path, by making investment into these areas and are already seeing early results and evidence of success. We have been collaborating with universities. In the last 70 days we have established programs with Stanford for the Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, a premier provider of data science and data scientist, as well as a design school faculty members in helping establish a massive embrace of design thinking at Infosys.", "We also partnered with the East China Normal University to help teach the teachers, as well as other universities in Europe like TU Berlin in areas around working with startups and in advance technologies.", "We have been establishing partnerships with Microsoft, with Hitachi, with Huawei, as well as expanding our partnerships with Oracle and SAP. Engaging with startup companies in innovating and investing in ways to engage with our employees such as the Murmuration, an initiative that we launched and we already have a few dozen POCs going of the Infosys information platform and on Big Data.", "All of this tells us that a new, a next generation services company is on the horizon. We believe that a company that brings in capabilities such as the ones that I have outlined will be a next generation services company. We believe that Infosys can not only be such a next generation services company, but can once again define what it means to be an IT services company. A great company based on innovation, that is founded based on a foundation of intellect and values.", "We, myself our entire leadership team, our board and the entire employee population of Infosys is 100% committed to these goals and we look forward to the rest of the journey. In the coming quarters I look forward to sharing with you more detailed plans of our execution on these strategies and more tangible articulation on what these strategies will mean for our business, our investment and their expected outcomes.", "Let me now talk about the business highlights for the second quarter of this fiscal year. Our U.S. dollar revenue grew 3.1% as reported and 3.9% in constant currency. Our growth was quire broad, across most of our industry verticals, across geographies and across service offerings. By itself our services business grew by 3.6% in reported currency and 4.4% in constant currency.", "Our Finacle business did not have such a great quarter and posted a 5.4% decline in a quarter-on-quarter basis. We have taken action to elevate this. We have just announced a leadership change. Michael Reh has now taken over as the Head of the Finacle business will be executing plans on several fronts to return this business to growth and success as in outlined earlier.", "Volume growth for this quarter was 3.0% and per capita revenue growth for IT services was 0.6% in reported terms and 1.3% in constant currency terms. Our operating margin for the quarter, went up by 100 basis points to 26.1%. This is good, because it allows us to better plan our investments for growth and this is despite one time investments that we have made that Rajiv will outline later.", "Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, which is a quarter-over-quarter growth of 6%. We added 49 new clients during the quarter. The gross employee addition was over 14,000.", "We have taken several initiatives over the last few months to address some of the attrition issues that we have had and these are now beginning to yield positive results, with attrition declining month over month during this quarter.", "This continues to be an important area of attention for us. Our quarterly performance has enabled us to pay our employees on average 100% of the bonus for Q2 for the first time in 16 quarters.", "As mentioned earlier, winning large annuity engagements continues to be an important part of our strategy. During this quarter we signed seven large deals with a TCV of $600 million; five deals were in the Americus, one in Europe and one elsewhere in the world. Two were in financial services and one each in Retail, Manufacturing, Telecom, Life Sciences and Energy and Utility.", "The overall deal pipeline and decision cycles have remained steady over the last three months. Pricing also remains stables in most areas. Some commodity areas are seeing a downward pressure, whereas other innovative areas have opportunities for us to deliver and achieve much great value.", "Our products and platforms business which was established as EdgeVerve Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Infosys in the last quarter is seeing increased momentum with prospects and clients and we see great opportunities for EdgeVerve as I articulated earlier.", "We have maintained our revenue guidance for financial year 2015 to 7% to 9% despite significant cross currency movements during the year. As you can see, we had a very good quarter, one that we are proud of, and as I mentioned in my strategy description earlier, we are looking forward to growth in the coming quarters and to sharing with you additional details as we go forward and build out a deeper operational plan based on the strategies that I have mentioned.", "With that, let me hand over to my colleague and my friend and our COO, Pravin.", "Pravin Rao ", "Thanks Vishal. Let me talk about highlights in various business segments. In financial services we had a growth of 2.5% on constant currency basis quarter-on-quarter for the services part. Other challenges remain in this sector with many banks looking at cutting back spend on both, Run the Business and Change the Business programs. There is intense focus on efficiency improvements, as well as spend in the areas of risk and compliance, client facing initiative, digital and new products. Recent cycles are slightly faster compared to 12 months back.", "In the insurance, Digital and Big Data are gaining prominence along with analytics. New demand and deal pipeline in the sector is good. In cards and payments, digital and technology modernizations are the top two trends. There is a lot of focus on security given this state of breaches of late.", "Retail and CPG continues to see challenges due to postponement of large initiatives and long duration cycles. While pipeline is healthy, there are delays in ramp-ups of programs won earlier. Retailers are extensively focusing on digital commerce and analytics, while CPG companies are focusing on cost reductions and brand building.", "In manufacturing, there is an increase in spend in high-tech lead by ISVs, Telco OEMs and devices and equipment. Trend in industrial manufacturing in also increasing, while auto is flat and aerospace is experiencing a reduction in spend. Growth in the sector is largely driven by Americus on both discretionary and non-discretionary sides.", "In telecom the industry trends remain similar to last quarter, with decline in top-line in both wire line and wireless, squeezing spend and triggering consolidation in the sector. LAN focus is on customer experience improvement, churn reduction and operational efficiency. While we say another quarter of strong in quarter two, we expect growth challenges in the upcoming quarters as mentioned earlier.", "In energy, while super majors are focusing on improved operation efficiency, oil field services clients are witnessing, increased activity in the international market. Clients are looking for efficiency improvement, application rationalization and better business intelligence. Decision cycles remain stable in this vertical.", "Life Sciences in witnessing mergers and acquisitions and diversification activity, due to which division making is slow. Additionally (inaudible) is leading to cost cutting by clients.", "There is an increase in activity in the ERP transformation, Digital Managed Services, SaaS based solutions and complaints. There is a significant reduction in discretionary spend. Deal pipeline are showing some improvement, though division cycles remain similar to last quarter.", "In growth markets there is a demand for utility based pricing and asset service models. There is an increase in combined IT BPO deals and cloud infrastructure deals.", "Deal pipeline and division cycles remain steady. In BPO client conversations are more around transformation of the business processes, with clients looking up to service providers to take end-to-end ownership of that processes. Though cost continued to drive outsourcing, discussions around value and domain expertise are becoming predominant.", "Finacle growth was impacted during this quarter due to delay in deferment of closure of some of the large deals. Markets for Finacle continues to remain soft due to its discretionary orientation and client preference being towards step changes rather than large transformations.", "In cloud and infrastructure services, demand is high and adoption of public cloud in on the rise. Our strategy to help simplify and industrialize client operations and helping them avoided to leverage Digital and cutting Edge technologies is a clear differentiator.", "We have been rated as a challenger in the Gartner rating for 2014 for North American Data Center Outsourcing, which is a significant improvement from operation in 2012.", "With regards to digital, we had strong growth in quarter two in Americus, led largely by retail and CPG and manufacturing verticals. Digital is on top of our agenda for most plans, thereby leading to strong demand.", "I will now hand over to Rajiv to talk about financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal ", "Thank you, Pravin. For the next few minutes I\u2019ll take you through the financial highlights for the quarter.", "Revenue for the quarter was at $2.201 billion as against $2.133 billion last quarter, which is a sequential increase of a growth of 3.1%.", "During the quarter major global currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. For example, the euro depreciated about 3.8%, Australian about 1.7% and GBP by 1.5%. This has impacted our reported growth by approximately $16 million during the quarter; revenue growth in constant currency is at 3.9%.", "It is important to note that the revenue growth for IT services alone was at 3.6% in reported terms and 4.4% in constant currency terms. The Finacle and BPO continued to have growth challenges. BPO grew by only 0.7% during the quarter. While the softer growth in BPO was cyclical and we expect it to recovery in the coming quarters, the Finacle continues to have growth challenges something that we are aware off and are working on the product.", "It has sequentially declined by 5.4% during the quarter. On the margin front, the rupee has deprecated by 1.3%, against the U.S. dollar during the quarter, which has resulted in a positive impact of 0.3% on operating margins during the quarter. Our gross margins for the quarter were at 38.5% as against 37% last quarter.", "Operating margins for the quarter went above 100 basis points, to 26.1%, net margins for the quarter was at 23.2% compared to 22.6% last quarter. The increasing operating margins were primarily driven by an increase of 2.2% in utilization from 80.1% last quarter to 82.3% in the current quarter, an improvement in on-site mix from 29.2% in the previous quarter to 28.7% in this quarter and the rupee depreciation that I spoke about earlier.", "The expansion in margin is after making significant investments in the business during the quarter. We promoted around 12,000 employees during the quarter, the highest we have done in any single quarter in the history. We will be paying as Vishal mentioned, an average of 100% bonus to our employees during the quarter.", "We have increased our investments in customer delivery, education and training and in sales. We contributed $30 million U.S. dollars to Infosys Foundation for the quarter ended 30 September 2014 for CSR activities.", "Other income for the quarter was at $144 million U.S. dollars, which included a ForEx gain of $24 million. Yield on other income was at 9.34% during the quarter. We have outstanding hedges of $1.027 billion as on September 30, 2014. Effective tax rate for the quarter was at 29%.", "Cash and cash equivalent, including available for sale assets and certificates on deposits were at $5.443 billion as on September 30. We saw good collections during the quarter as the results of which, the DSO for the quarter dropped to 62 days as compared to 66 days last quarter.", "I\u2019m happy to inform you that the broad has declared an interim dividend of INR 30 per share, which will be approximately $0.49 based on the currency exchange rates. The Infosys Board has also recommended a one is to one bonus of issue of equity shares and one is to one stock dividend of American Depositary shares to increase liquidity of the share and expand the shareholder base.", "I\u2019ll briefly touch up on the outlook for FY \u201915. The guidance for the year has been maintained at 7% to 9% in spite of significant cross currency moment between the last few months.", "As you would have noticed, the present markets have been extremely volatile and more of the major currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollars. For example, the euro has depreciated by 8.8% against the U.S. dollar between March and September. The Australian dollar has depreciated by 5.7% and Swiss Franc by 7.9% during the same period.", "On the margin front we have seen an expansion in margins during the quarter on account of strong operational performance. Historically Q3 and Q4 has been soft quarters for us. We continued to make substantial investments in our business to accelerate and sustain our growth. We expect the operating margins to continue to be around 25% for the year, plus or minus 1%. However, the seen may vary quarter-on-quarter depending on our investment requirements.", "With that, I\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen & Co", "Yes, thank you very much. First is for Dr. Sikka. Based on the steps you are planning to take to transform the business, how should we think about it in the fee margin (inaudible) years and then also in the long run (inaudible) beyond. Second one for Rajiv, well speaking (ph) about the application, how should we think about utilization for fiscal year 2015 versus hiring time and thank you and best of luck?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Moshe, let me address the first part of your question and then for the second one Rajiv can answer that, but it wasn\u2019t very clear, so perhaps when I\u2019m done with my answer you can repeat your second question.", "So with regard to the growth ahead and the margins, as Rajiv said, we are presently maintaining our margin outlook. The strategy that I have outlined, it will take time for this to take shape and to start getting reflected in a meaningful way in the P&L.", "Having said that, and over the next couple of quarters, we are going to further outline this in much more detail and quantitatively to give you better guidance, both in terms of investments and capital allocations, as well as in terms of the forecast on growth and outlooks.", "Having said that, we do feel very confident about the long-term growth of the strategy, the long-term growth, as well as profitability of the strategy that we have outlined. Such that new service and the next generation services company, as I envision Infosys to become \u2013 would see a significant growth, as well as profitability at the same time.", "And one other point that I would like to make is, as we detail this and given the inherent latencies in the business even though the results will take time to get there, we are already seeing the first early signs of success of the strategy in an engagement that we are starting to do with clients, both in terms of renewing our existing services, as well as bringing new services to life.", "So the journey ahead is going to be one where it will take some time to achieve the meaningful impact but at the same time we are going to get there incrementally and not that the results will show up in a big bang down the line.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Okay and then the second part, that\u2019s for Rajiv. As I said, at current utilizations, it\u2019s at peak levels right now. Should we expect these to move higher or should be (inaudible) hiring right now given the demand that you are seeing.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Moshe, I\u2019ll try answering, but I couldn\u2019t get the complete question. I think the line is not very clear. But our utilization for the quarter is at 82.3%, which is an all time high. I haven\u2019t seen this kind of utilization over the last many, many years.", "As we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters, I had been always maintaining that \u2013 I believe that the right utilization will be about 80% to 82% and over the last couple of quarters we have taken a lot of initiatives to reach that number.", "Having said that, I think there is a need to make investments. We have to hire ahead of time, we have to hire for the growth that see in the next year, and as a result you would see us investing more in the business, hiring more people, hiring the right skill set and that would mean that they could be in the short terms, some impact on the margins because of hiring ahead of the curve.", "Having said that, I think there is a lot of focus in the company on automation, on productivity improvements and this is an environment where it\u2019s not early to get pricing increase from the customer on a year on year basis. So we have to drive productivity improvement on automation, to drive better value for our clients, at the same time improve our margins on an ongoing basis.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company", "Thank you again and best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Hi. My first question is just on the growth prospects for the company. I think you trailed industry growth rate for a little while and I think the initiative was to get back over those industry growth rates. Can you just revisit that particular issue and is this about improving the prospects of the core business before, you know the new plan or is this about putting both forwarded at the same time.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Joseph, it is about putting both forward at the same time, to simultaneously renew our existing business and achieve a much better efficiency, innovation and operational excellence out of that, but at the same time complement that and augment that with a new set of services that we offer, a new set of innovative capabilities that we offer, so that the sum total of that would help us achieve over time industry leading growth and profitability, which has been our target.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay and then on the attrition side, it ticked up this quarter despite I think the increased bonuses. Can you talk a little bit about why the rate continued to pick-up and what are you expecting for the attrition rate to do over the long term.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Joseph, the attrition on an LTM basis is still, is a little bit above 20% and that continues to be of concern for us. However we have taken many steps around attrition and if you look at the month over month numbers, they have already declined, so it heading in the right direction.", "As I had mentioned, when I started the actions that we talk around attrition will take some time to take shape because of the long nature of these latencies of people deciding and then going through the process of leaving and so forth.", "So we are seeing encouraging signs here when we look at it on a month by month basis that the attrition is coming and we feel confident that both based on the measures that we have taken to improve our position on attrition, as well as now the strategy around growth and the results and we believe that a combination of these will over time bring us back down to the levels that are more normal for us in the industry.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay and then the last question from me. You laid out a fairly ambitious plan for the business and given the fact that it\u2019s been a services company for a long period of time, it seems like that culture will be changing a bit. Can you just layout for us a couple of organizational changes that you feel need to take place in order to be successful and what you think the impact of those changes will be?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t see any cyclical changes in the organization any time soon. The team, our management team, this has been my first quarter. This has been the first quarter for us to work together. It has been a great experience; it has been an amazing experience. We have a young dynamic, passionate team that is driven towards success and it has been a great experience for me to work with our team and I look forward to that.", "Of course as you see in the example with Finacle, as we see an opportunity to make changes and take corrective actions, we will do so swiftly. But I don\u2019t see any structural reason to make any changes at this time. I think our team is fully equipped to go after this agenda that I have outlined.", "A key part to getting to kind of transformation that we are talking about, is to ensure that we continue to focus on education. Infosys is a company that heavily values education and training and learning. I believe that education is at the heart of any company\u2019s transformation.", "After all if you think about it, any company that goes through a fundamental change in its business had to reeducate, has to retrain, reskill their workforce, has to get their employees to think differently about the role of the future and has to take those actions. So therefore learning and education is always at the heart of any company\u2019s transformation, but it especially true for Infosys where education has always been at the heart of what we do.", "Mr. Moorthy, our Founder, you should talk about learnability, the ability to learn as the thing that is fundamental to Infosys. 20 years ago we did not have BPO or IMS or services like this. Who knows what kinds of services we\u2019ll have 10 to 15 years from now, but we will have education then, just as we had education 20 years ago.", "So a strong focus on education and on learning is at the heart of our ability to transform ourselves, to be able to do these kinds of things that I have outlined and we have already taken major steps in this direction. We have been teaching, design thinking to our company. We have already started that in a massive way, in partnership with many faculty and professors from Standford\u2019s d. school and the D Global initiative.", "We have already done the first training classes of design thinking for our executive management and many of our senior management members, leaders of our consulting teams, leaders of our sales teams. We have already done the first sessions of training some of our great teachers, our trainers on design thinking and as we speak we are launching a massive embrace of design thinking for all Infosians and I expect that before the end of this year, we will have trained 25,000 Infosys employees on design thinking.", "Similarly we are doing a huge embrace of artificial intelligence based on the CS 188 class out of Berkeley. We have been putting together a great new artificial intelligence class. I am myself doing \u2013 hoping to find some time to do some of these computer science classes and so on.", "So we are looking into not only using education and investing and doubling down on education as a great mechanism for our organizational transformation, but we are also looking to invest in education itself and in finding new ways to train and so forth. So more so than the management, I would advice looking at our ability to educate and to train as a great mechanism for our organizational transformation.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "Yes, hi Vishal. Your commentary and vision on the whole artificial intelligence is quite interesting. Can you share a couple of key areas where Infosys could benefit materially? I mean, what is the nature of jobs in this artificial intelligence paradigm. And also as a follow-up, you talked about investments. Can you share with us what would be the nature of some of these investments? Thanks.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "We see AI as impacting many of our lines of businesses in a very fundamental way. If you look at infrastructure management for example, automation and rule based systems and so forth can have a tremendous impact in how a landscape can be managed automatically or more or less automatically where people can manage these by exception.", "If you look at BPO, many processes which are based on documents and voice can be revolutionized with the iTechnique, with voice processing, with text processing and image recognition and so forth, as well as rule based systems and machine learning to understand and detect correct behavior and taking actions based on that behavior.", "So we believe that our existing services can be significantly improved by embracing AI techniques there, as well as of course in completely new kinds of applications that we can build in complex areas and intelligent adaptive sense and response type behaviors, whether it is machines and machine based systems, whether it is in connected cars or connected vehicles, airlines, all systems where we design the system and then the system is in production, where it can be integrated into a intelligent adaptive system, can have a significant impact from AI.", "So the kinds of jobs there are around of course managing my exception, around modeling. Modeling of systems and system behavior, creating rules, creating the constrains around which learning can happen, these are some very high paying, high skill jobs that we are looking forward to having within Infosys and I think that that can have a great impact, both of the existing services as well as new areas that we can go into and we are starting that training in earnest.", "By the way, one other area that we are extremely excited about is in language processing, natural language processing, using the same information platform that I talked about earlier with open source components. We see a great opportunity in industries like insurance or banking, where automatic analysis of new stories and extraction of events and events of significance, whether it is on the risk side or on the growth side can have a great impact to our business and we are already starting to do projects in these areas.", "On the investment side, I would not limit it to any particular area. We are excited about many areas. Of course in the AI techniques and these kinds of automation techniques, as well as in new ways of collaborating, because remote work forces and remote abilities to work together are of great interest to us.", "So we are looking in many areas like that, as well as in under penetrated areas of verticals; some areas in energy, in healthcare in detail and in many geographies as well. So I wouldn\u2019t put any particular area or a segment as a focus for investment, just a broad interest in participating in the growth of other companies.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "And if you don\u2019t mind, if I squeeze one small question again. Can we expect M&A on some of these initiatives by Infosys over the next several quarters?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes.", "Anil Doradla - William Blair", "Thanks a lot and best of luck Vishal.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thank you Anil.", "Operator", "The next question is from Rishi Jhunjhunwala of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs", "Yes hi, thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 Vishal, this question is for you; just a sense of conversations that you have been having with the customers and with the employees in INFY over the past 70 days. What are the key concerns that have been highlighted by the customers regarding INFY and the key issues that would have been raised by employees during your conversation? And as a follow-up, what were your responses to them and did anything come as an unexpected surprise. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "That\u2019s a great question. I think that all the clients that I talked to increasingly and this differed across industries, but increasingly all the clients that we talked to no longer have the patience for what we could call Yesterday\u2019s Services. They don\u2019t want to have staff augmentation or labor arbitrage, simply for the sake of saving costs. They aspire to have improvements in business processes, better outcomes.", "They want to learn what new ways are of running processes, of running businesses efficiently, they want to understand how to innovate and they want to help in getting into new areas. So if anything, their primary frustration is in not having a more innovative mindset, not having a more open mindset towards how business outcomes can be improved, how business process excellence can be achieved and things of that nature.", "In other words, I have across my interactions with several hundred clients, have seen a tremendous dissatisfaction with the way IT services of yesterday use to be and a tremendous desire to engage on new kinds of ways of bringing value and innovation and so forth.", "And with employees it is a similar thing. They look for a great purpose to work on innovative projects, to work on next generation kinds of things. They also look for simpler, efficient ways of working, efficient systems, efficient processes and so on. So we have been focusing heavily on that, on dramatically simplifying our own complexities, on improving our operational efficiency and things of that nature and over time, as these things become more concrete and some of the results start to become more visible, we look forward to sharing those with you.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo", "Thank you. Good evening. I guess my question is on capital deployment with $5.2 billion in cash and well over $1 billion in cash generated every year. Could you update us on your cash dividend payout strategy? Maybe as a percent of cash flow what you might want to direct towards acquisitions and whether a repurchase, stock repurchase is a part of the board consideration. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Maybe I can start and then Rajiv, you can answer this in more detail. First of all well, we are very proud of the $5.4 billion in cash that we have and we believe \u2013 first of all we believe that it is a little bit early to make a more precise statement about this. I and our management have not yet had enough time to sufficiently articulate in detail the strategies that I have laid out. We will do so over the next couple of quarters and so around the April timeframe where we start our financial year, I would expect to be able to give more precise answers on capital allocation and things of this nature.", "Having said that, as you can tell, I have a very innovation oriented mindset here. We see Infosys as an innovation driven company, as a growth driven company and we see tremendous opportunity to leverage that cash that we have towards these objectives. Rajiv.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Hi. So Vishal said, I think its \u2013 we have to wait to detail out our plans, what Vishal has laid out as a high level strategy today. We have to work on our business plans, on the execution strategy, on what kind of allocation of capital that we do between different strategies and different execution engines that we want to come out with and only after that will it be appropriate for us to be able to say exactly how much of the cash is going to be accessed or not or whether its going to be less than what we need.", "Having said that, the board every quarter during their derivation look at the capital deployment and as and when they feel appropriate, I think they will take the right decision.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo", "Right. My other question is your talking about a real change in personality for Infosys and your going to work with your deployment group on the knowledge side. What about your sales organization? Can you adjust the capabilities of the group you have or will you have to seek significant outside talent to execute on your strategy. Thanks.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "And just as on the operational side, we are in the process of revitalizing our sales team, our sales and marketing functions towards this type of operational excellence, towards being able to articulate values to do solutioning, to be able to get into new areas to do design thinking together with plans, to do co-creation. So that means the same rescaling that we have talked about in other areas has to also apply to the sales part of the organization and we are already working on this.", "As I mentioned, the first set of trainings in these new areas for the leadership of sales has already happened, derivative of consulting has already happened. But as we go forward we will also be adjusting our processes, the way we manage the pipelines, the mine accounts, the way we \u2013 to change the level of the dialogue that we have directly, to go engage more with the CXO suite, as well as the compensation structures and things of that nature.", "So we are looking at \u2013 we have already started this. So Mr. Moorthy started this more than a year ago and we are going to continue that heavily, because we believe that we will need a world-class sales operational and sales and operational excellence in order to achieve the objectives that we have talked about.", "However I do believe that we have the elements in place already, so that this rescaling and this transformation can be done from within and we don\u2019t need to do a structural change to do that.", "Edward Caso - Wells Fargo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "Hi, thank you. I have two as well if I could. The first one is you talked about the financial services industry. Could you talk a little bit out, is this more Infosys or is this a broad base impact across the industry and related to that if you could talk about, you mentioned a new leadership change. What are the objectives there, what\u2019s the strategy thing to kind of revitalize growth and then I have a follow-up please.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So I think that you have to separate the financial services vertical performance from the finacle performance. Finacle is our core banking product and the product suite where we had a very dissatisfying quarter and we have made a leadership change. We have brought in a great new leader with Michael Reh to run the Finacle business and we expect that this business will get back to growth and success.", "We have a great installed base in Finacle with almost 180 banks around the world servicing 0.5 billion people and it is if you look at analysts reports and so forth it is, view it as the best and if its not one of the best banking products in the world. So we are very excited about that. I mean we have had issues with this over the last few quarters and we have already taken an action there.", "With regard to the broader financial services business, this continues to be a great business for us and is growing and I\u2019ll ask Mohit who runs our financial services business to talk more about it.", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes, I think on the financial services business, it has grown by 2.5% quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis. We have grown much faster than Europe and I think what we\u2019re seeing is there are four key trends that we\u2019ve spoken about even earlier, which is industrialization, digital, risk and compliance and infrastructure modernization, and so I think for the second half of the year we remain cautiously optimistic on the opportunities.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "But you didn\u2019t mention what the issue was and you said you are fixing it, but I didn\u2019t hear what the issue was over the past couple of quarters.", "Mohit Joshi", "The issues of Finacle have been basically across the board from the development and operations to sales, the efficiency of the development processes. It was simply a IC that as an organization that it sort of stalled a little bit and its stagnated and you saw that in the business performance over the last few quarters and so we believe that with a great leader, with a development in an innovation oriented mindset, we will be able to get this business back to growth fairly quickly.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Let me ask my follow-up then. As you mentioned in interesting roadmap surrounding investment opportunities, could you at least give us some perspective on how long into areas like AI, what\u2019s the investment period that you envisioned. Is this a multi year cycle of investments and if it is such, would you anticipate at least directionally that margins would decline during this investment cycle. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t have a very precise answer for you on the AI one. I think my sense is that it is going to be a multi year effort. We will detail this out over the next couple of quarters to be more precise about it. However we will go about this in a very swift and efficient way. In a very incremental and iterative way as we bring these to life.", "Some of the solutions that I talked about, like an area of bringing AI techniques to helpdesk or to language processing for applications in insurance and banking and so forth, these we have already started on. But to do a much more massive embrace like the kind that I have in mind will take multiple years.", "In other areas like in Big Data, we are already seeing \u2013 I mean we have a few dozen POCs going already with huge clients around the platform that I mentioned, which brings together an assemble of open source based technology. There is a lot of exciting work happening there together with proprietary and our partner technologies in information processing. To bring great new Big Data analytical solutions to life and we have already started to work with our clients in this area and that work is something that we are really excited about.", "Keith Bachman -Bank of Montreal", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Hi. Vishal, my question was I was hoping to get your perspective on the software landscape and what I want to know is, do you think that your software partners will be more or less important in the future of Infosys than they have been in the past?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "They will continue to be significantly important to us. We work in an ecosystem. Our clients work in an ecosystem. Their landscapes are not only heterogeneous, they are permanently heterogeneous. They are going to look at a company like us as a neutral provider of advice and guidance, as well as help in managing these heterogeneous landscapes. So we ourselves in that light and we see ourselves in a very symbiotic relationship with our ecosystem partners and I continue to see the strength of that going forward.", "We do see in the new side of the equation, in the next generation solutions we see a tremendous embrace of open source products of new platforms, what many people call the third platform and so forth and these are much more cloud oriented, cloud scale, open source based technology platforms which have a much higher, a much different cost performance profile compared to the traditional interface platforms.", "So in that sense, in the new areas I think that you will see more and more work done on these kind of approaches, but working together with an ecosystem of partners and especially software partner, its fundamental to the Infosys story and will continue to be the case.", "Jamie Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ravi Menon of Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking", "Thank you for the opportunity. There are two questions, one is due for Vishal and the other is for the CFO. One is, Vishal spoke of the sales leadership already adding some new talent and could you elaborate how your deepening your ability on the sales side to understand customer needs. For instance are you hiring senior technologists with experience in the domains like CIO is from a particular segment like retail for instance.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, we have been adding new talent across, especially in the higher ranks of our health organizations to bring in more domain expertise, to bring in more expertise in solutioning and so on and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But increasingly we see a need for clients who see us as advisors, especially in new areas and to do that we need to bring in the new kinds of skills in co-creation, in thinking together and working together with clients on what next generation problems are like.", "We are already starting to do engagements like this. Many of our leaders are working on things of this nature, so perhaps I can ask Sandeep who has been doing this in the retail and CPG area, to share his experience and how his sales team has been able to do some of these kinds of engagements already in new areas.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Sure. This is Sandeep and what we\u2019ve been doing is inducting talent from MBA universities at the lower levels and at the senior levels, also going through design thinking training on the lines of some of our new solutions.", "If you take the new Infosys information platform as an example, that we launched literally a few weeks ago, even in the few weeks that have ensued, the sales team has gone out and had multiple dozens of conversations and already engaged in multiple proof of concepts with clients to prove these new platforms out and then engage at a larger scale. So there is both, outside talent coming in, as well as internal talent being trained and aggressively running campaigns with new, more powerful solutions. Thank you.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking", "Thanks. I appreciate the clarification. Secondly, Rajiv, if you could clarify, there was any room for cutting talent in the G&A side, because last quarter you had a real 1.5% in the portion for impairment foreseeables, but this quarter I see your G&A is still flat Q-o-Q. So is there any room for leverage there to offset some of the sales and marketing investments?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, we continuously keep looking at opportunities for optimizing our costs further and G&A is one area where we have optimized over the last many, many quarters. I think we also have to ensure that we drive more productivity and improve our processes in the G&A area. So that is one area that we continuously keep looking at.", "But again if you compare it with the rest of the industry, I think it\u2019s the lowest in the industry. Even if your able to optimize costs further, it may not be very significant on the P&L. So we have to look at cost optimization all across our management, be it the (inaudible) organization, the sales organization, in the best functions. So I think that\u2019s something that we do on an ongoing basis.", "Ravi Menon - Centrum Broking", "Great, thank you. Best of luck!", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Karan Uppal of Equirus Securities. Please go ahead.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Yes, hi. I have a couple of questions here. So first I wanted to ask them, when you\u2019re trying to implement the consulate designed thinking, which you find that again stand and binds more exploratory thinking around any kind of solution. So in a timeframe of the services business generally you could deliver it in a short period of time on a specified deadline, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a radical change in the way it could be implemented successfully in this business model?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t see that as a radical change. I see that as an evolution of the way that we create opportunity in new areas. I see that as a great methodology for helping our clients think through what their approach needs to be in some of these unchartered, unprecedented kinds of new territories and new containers that they need to get into and that applies to every industry as they go through the digital transformation.", "So in many ways I guess you could say that I see that as an inevitability that we have to do that and when you look at it operationally, that takes the shape of something that is complementary to the normal traditional services, so you would say I have a handful of design projects which are small, incremental, rapidly done, but high value and high margin.", "Complement the existing kinds of services that are happening at the same client and increasingly we\u2019ll see sort of this mix off of these things, where design thinking is used to on the one hand improve the existing services that we bring and existing projects that are going on and on the other hand to do new short time window, highly iterative, high value projects that are in new areas and therefore of significant importance to clients and we\u2019ll see a mix of both of these.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Okay. The other question was more on the BPO side. So recently we have seen and as you have also pointed out in your opening remarks, that companies, including the IT vendors have been kind of building on acquiring these so called industrialized platforms and then offering it on a pay as you go model to the end users. So this is the future of business scenario if you envision it to be likely. ", "Would that create a case where a winner take all paradigm for the guide who holds the so called successful platform in a specific vertical or will there be room for everybody to participate in that kind of movement?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "It is too early to tell. I would see definitely an opportunity where someone who can offer a much more integrated stack with a next generation business process management offering, which has heavy use of improvement built into it using automation and artificial intelligence, together with the ability to run that infrastructure and the associated applications and so forth could have an advantage.", "On the other hand, clients might also decide that putting too much into the hands of one vendor might be too risky and so my sense is that you\u2019ll see a mix of those, but it is too early to tell. This idea of integrated IT and BPO or Business Process as a service is still very early and we are seeing signs of these opportunities emerge on both sides where some where clients have a very clear partitioning across the kinds of offerings and others where we do the integrated offerings.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Okay. If I can just squeeze a last one for Rajiv or just two. One, was that how do we read in your client metrics. We have like the $300 million going from one to zero, how should we read that? And secondly if you can just help us with the margin bridge for the quarter?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes, on the margin \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second part first. On the margin if you look at it during the quarter, utilization improved by 2.3% and the rupee had also depreciated by about \u2013 the rupee had depreciated during the quarter, which had given us a benefit of about 0.3% of the margin. Those put together actually helped us improve our bidding margins by about 100 basis points. What was the first one?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "$300 million client.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes, on the $300 million client, this is calculated on an LTM basis and it depends on the run rate of the client over the last four quarters. So the largest client has dropped off from a $300 million client it is about $290 million or you know typically it depends on the run rate. Four quarters back there was a revenue, which was good or bad. Depending on the clients the total revenue from client would keeps shifting.", "So again, on a quarter to quarter basis there\u2019s not much to look into it, but yes, the good part is that if you look at the $1 million clients and the $5 million clients and the $10 million clients, I think the numbers have been increasing consistently with the last many quarters and that is something which gives us the confidence about the future.", "Karan Uppal - Equirus Securities", "Okay, thanks. Thanks gentlemen. All the best!", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you. Vishal, good message on the automation and digitization fronts , I sort of agree with you on both these trends, but one of the things is that both digitalization and automation implies a major change from the current FTE basis of thinking and when you kind of correlate that with your own experience speaking with clients in the last 70 days, where you say many of these clients are unhappy with the old style of outsourcing, are these clients \u2013 how willing are these clients to change sort of the way they contract with you and go from a FTE basis to maybe a different basis.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "It is a mix. So there are clients of course in certain industries and certain geographies who see a great need for this, an urgency to do these new kinds of projects, whereas in other industries and other geographies they are looking at these, they are experimenting with them, but they continue with the existing one. So it is a kind of a distribution of, you could say innovative from the ones that need the most urgency, depending on the nature of the situation.", "In those cases where they do see the urgency of the outgoing innovative projects, we see a tremendous willingness to try out new models, new ways of articulating the value or sharing the value or having us share a portion of the value that is created and new ways of contracting to achieve that and so forth.", "And so it is a mix and I think that you have to adopt a kind of a tiered strategy depending on the nature of the client and the depending on where they are in their evolution of their particular business and how they see their business evolving. This is one of the areas that we will articulate in more detail over the next couple of quarters as our large-scale sales strategy towards these approaches becomes clearer.", "Presently what we are doing is, with early adopters we are engaging in these kinds of projects like the few dozen big data projects that I talked about or the adoption of artificial intelligence or connected car and things of this nature. So as the early success of those early adopters gets us into more and more experience that we then use to drive more scale in those businesses.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it. And then a more near term question. You added 49 clients this quarter. As I look at the number of clients added in the last eight quarters on average, that number is 59. I know it can jump up and down, but 49 I think is probably the lowest number since 2Q\u201913 for you guys. Is there anything to read into that with regards to maybe what\u2019s going on? Is this a result of maybe sales force turnover or what\u2019s going on here?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No, no, no. I wouldn\u2019t read any of that into it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. Could you elaborate on what\u2019s going on?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think there are many factors that go into new kinds of deals, into sizes of deals and how the contracting processes are like and so forth. So depending on the nature of the deals that happen to be in the pipeline or near closure in that particular time period is what determines the number of deals that we get in a quarter, so it is always a mix of these things. So the fact that the number of deals is what it is, my sense of it is this is of no consequence. Perhaps Pravin, you can add something to that.", "Pravin Rao", "We actually have added a lot of bandwidth to the sales as well. We have added 150 account managers. We have added about 170 people, sales folks where we hired from leading business schools in the US. So we have increased the sales bandwidth, so I think it\u2019s not a secular turn, so I don\u2019t think we should be leading too much into it.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Got it. Understood. Thank you guys and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rishabh Chudgar of Enam Holdings. Please go ahead.", "Nihar Shah - Enam Holdings", "Hi sir. This is Nihar Shah here from Enam Holdings. I just had one question. In terms of your strategy that you\u2019ve outlined, can you sort of elaborate a little bit on how that will impact the future hiring. In the sense, would it be more towards the lateral versus freshers and how do you see that sort of also impacting the pyramid as you execute on your strategy over a three to five year timeframe. That\u2019s all from my side.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think in the near term it is too early to say that there is any structural change to how we hire. We are simply committed to diversify the global, the workforce that we have in all major dimensions, but I would not see a significant change in the hiring, simply because the nature of the new things is such that it is still very, very small and very early.", "I mean typically at Infosys we hire close to 10,000 people in the near and if we hire a couple of hundred data scientists and so forth, it doesn\u2019t really change the overall picture that much, even though it is an incredibly strategic area for us. So I wouldn\u2019t see a great change in the mix of hiring in the near term, however we are very committed to diversifying the nature of our workforce, bringing in additional talent in many different areas, whether it is in geographies or in new skills and so forth and we will continue to do that.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. That\u2019s all from my side. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Due to time constraints we will not be able to take any further questions. We thank you all for joining us on this call and look forward to talking to you again. Have a good weekend ahead.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

Over these past 3 months, in my meetings with more than 500 client executives and several industry analysts, I am very encouraged to see strong resonance with the direction that we have embarked upon. The duality of renewing the core systems and processes and, at the same time, innovating into new frontiers, founded on a culture of learning, creativity and purpose, is indeed true for pretty much every business today. It is a challenging duality, one that requires the talent and resources of our company to simultaneously address 2 distinct challenges, 2 distinct opportunities. Success and longevity comes from embracing these dual goals and treading a carefully chosen middle path, one which reaches towards the vision of the future without disrupting or ignoring the reality of today.", "For us at Infosys, it means that we offer our clients the best palette of services and solutions that fit their strategy. It also means fundamentally transforming ourselves while we help to transform each one of our clients.", "Over the holidays and in other forums, I have articulated a message to each of our employees to live this strategy and to contribute to this strategy, every single employee in everything that they do, every project, every client account, every service client and every unit of the company. Over the last several weeks, we have been actively planning and executing the elements required to realize this strategy, and we are already witnessing progress along several fronts.

This is the highest sequential volume growth in the last 3 years over any quarter and the highest third-quarter volume growth in the last [indiscernible]. But at the same time, we saw a drop in the realized revenue per billed employee. I am confident that the measures that we are taking to renew our operational services and to introduce new ways of doing things is the best way, and perhaps the only way, to compensate for the commoditization so we can do more with less for more.", "Our absolute revenue per employee grew from $52,300 per employee for the 12 months ending 30th September, 2014, to $52,740 per employee for the 12 months ending 31st of December, 2014.", "As we increase our momentum on building out an ecosystem of partners globally, we are pleased to announce that we have expanded our innovation fund from the current $100 million to $500 million to support the creation of the global ecosystem of strategic partners and startup companies.

I'm happy to report that to date, we have covered over 9,000 employees across the company with design thinking training with 400 of our senior-most employees recently doing these workshops at our university in Mysore and other places, trained by educators from the Stanford design school and others. 70% of our front-end consultants have already been trained, and this has now been made a part of our special training curriculum. We went further and brought our clients design to embrace design thinking concepts. We currently have a pipeline of workshops for over 25 clients planned. We believe this to enable a fundamental shift in the way that we approach solving client problems and solving our own challenges through innovation.", "Our artificial intelligence class that went into effect in October has already trained 1,000 people, and we want to train an additional 500 people in AI technologies per quarter. We are working with Stanford Graduate School of Business to design and deliver a customized strategic leadership development program for our companies' executives.", "In this last quarter, we have taken several steps to increase engagement with our employees in our mission to make Infosys a great place to work. We have set up dedicated teams that are working on and are already implementing several changes to simplify policies while stressing accountability and values.

More flexible work-from-home and maternity leave policies, increased team engagement budgets and easier transfer policies across our development centers.", "We announced a 100% bonus payout for Q2. For Q3, we have announced a 100% average bonus payout across the employee base, as well as a special holiday bonus to high-performing employees.

Pravin Rao", "Thanks, Vishal. Hello, everyone, and happy New Year. Let me cover the recent trends in various segments, including our initial expectations on planned budget for calendar year '15.", "In financial services, we had over 3% sequential growth during the quarter. There are differing trends across regions, with U.S. banks not spending as aggressively as their European counterparts. Budgets in U.S. banks are expected to be flat to marginally down, while they are expected to grow in European banks.", "Spending was predominantly driven by new channels around digital security and analytics and, in addition, continued spend on compliance. The pipeline in the vertical is strong and decision cycles are stable.", "In insurance, our growth in quarter 3 was driven by significant improvements in deal pipeline over the last 1 year. Insurance companies are focusing on modernization programs and on more sophisticated data analytics-based risk assessment programs. They are also talking to us about telematics and integrating with the autocar manufacturers to measure and influence driver behavior and associated risks better. Budgets are expected to grow low single digits, in line with the past.", "In cards and payments, digital and technology modernization are the top trends. Clients are also increasing spend from digital platforms that leverage social and mobile for marketing and customer services. Budgets are expected to be flat [ph].", "Retail and CPG continues to see challenges. Our growth during the quarter was impacted by ramp-downs in a few clients, along with impact from delaying commencement of projects won earlier. While spending has been volatile, apart -- sorry, while spending has been volatile, we see a lot of opportunities in retail and CPG, particularly strong interest and great conversations in driving a differentiated digital strategy for retailers not just for this -- not just for their online and mobile world, but also to revitalize their brick-and-mortar stores, leveraging digital. We are taking a strong, proactive point of view to market in this space.", "Apart from the above, we see spend in analytics, digital marketing and ERP rollouts. It is early for the next year budgets to get firmed up, since retailers normally start their budgets post closure of the holiday season.", "Growth in manufacturing was impacted during the quarter due to furloughs. Spending patterns are mixed: good in high-tech and auto, mixed in industrial [indiscernible]. There's an improvement in discretionary spend in North America towards customer experience, digital, analytics and ERP upgrades. Nondiscretionary spend is likely to be flat.", "Overall deal pipeline has reduced over the last 1 year, especially in Americas. We have seen some slowness in decision cycles in aerospace and industrials, as many clients are going through challenging times. At the structural level, budgets are expected to be flat over calendar year '14, except for a modest increase in automotive and reduction in aerospace.", "Telecom sector continues to struggle with declining top line and bottom line, which is reducing spend and triggering consolidation. Clients are focused on operational efficiency and cost reduction. This is likely to pressure IT budgets in calendar year '15, which, coupled with significant M&A activities in the sector, will impact our growth potential next year.", "In energy, due to the drop in oil prices, there's a significant shift towards cost savings and efficiency across the entire value chain. Capital projects, as well as on-support projects, are likely to see large reduction in budgets across the U.S. and Europe. Decision cycles have also been severely impacted. On the positive side, however, large deal pipeline is healthy. We are trying to accelerate growth through proactive features [ph], focus on new markets and bolstering our capabilities.", "Life sciences sector is witnessing longer sales cycle due to significant M&A activities and impact of patent cliff. Americas is expected to perform better than Europe. There is pressure on nondiscretionary spending, with most build from this area focused on cost reduction, technology rationalization and risk management. Overall pipeline has improved over the past 12 months.", "Clients have still not finalized their budgets, but early indications suggest tight budgets that increased spend in ERP implementations, cloud, SaaS-based solutions, analytics and compliance. In growth markets, there is reasonably good momentum in the market, though our reported growth is impacted due to declining local currencies against the U.S. dollar. We are seeing increased emphasis in adopting data [ph] strategies, ERP and modernization. Deal pipeline and decision cycles remain steady. There a budget pressure on clients, especially on discretionary spend.", "In BPO, client conversations are on transformation of the business processes, with clients looking up to service providers to take end-to-end ownership of their processes. This is driving a shift from FTE-based pricing to output-based and fixed pricing. Though cost continues to drive outsourcing, discussions around value and domain expertise are becoming predominant. Decision cycles continue to be longer for large deals.", "Finacle had a growth rebound during the quarter. We expect increased demand in calendar year 2015, especially in channel modernization, analytics, mobility, compliance and payments. Pipeline in Europe is looking healthier, with a number of banks trying to gain flexibility and economies of scale via infrastructure, products and process standardization.", "Demand from Tier 2 segment in the U.S. is improving, and some banks are having conversations around core banking replacement. However, due to discretionary profile of the spend, decision cycle remains protracted.", "With regards to digital, it continues to be amongst the top 3 agendas for most clients. At this point of digital transformation, customer are focused on portfolio simplification, cloud apps, marketing operations, building online presence and et cetera. Our pipeline is getting stronger, and deal conversion is steady. Though digital is discrete spend, decision-making is reasonably quick. We continue to invest in consulting capabilities, improving talent through training and forging partnerships and innovation to create business solutions.", "I will now hand over to Rajiv to talk about the financial highlights.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Pravin. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings for the quarter were at $2.218 billion, which is sequential growth of 0.8%. As you're all aware, during the quarter, major global currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. For example, euro depreciated by 5.3%, Australian dollar by 7.5% and GBP by 5.1% against the dollar. This impacts our revenue growth by 1.8%, without which the constant currency growth is at 2.6%.", "Q3, as you all know, is traditionally a weak quarter due to furloughs, holidays and lower working days. Considering that, I believe 2.6% is a good growth for this quarter. As Pravin mentioned, retail and CPG continues to see challenges and has declined by 0.7% in constant currency during the quarter.", "Our gross margin for the quarter increased by 20 basis points to 38.7%. Operating margins for the quarter went up by 60 basis points to 26.7%. This is the highest level of growth in operating margin in the last 10 quarters. Our net margin for the quarter was at 23.5%, and EPS for the quarter was at $0.46.", "On some of our operational parameters, utilization, excluding trainees, increased to 82.7% in the quarter. This was the highest level of utilization that we have seen in the last 11 years in any quarters. Utilization, including trainees, was at 75.7%. Onsite mix improved from 28.7% to 28.5% in the quarter.", "As Vishal mentioned, we have taken multiple steps -- measures on attrition front. During the quarter, we have given 5,000 promotions, and we have also announced 100% variable payout to our employees. We have also done selective salary corrections for certain skills and technology streams. As a result of all these measures, our attrition, on an annualized basis, is at 21 -- is down from 21.3% at the group level to 18.1%.", "We contributed $10 million in the quarter on CSR activities. We have outstanding hedges of $1.076 billion as of December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was at 28.2%.", "Our operations in the quarter were very good, as a result of which, the DSO dropped to 61 days as compared to 63 days last quarter.", "Our cash and cash equivalent, including available-for-sale assets and certificates for deposits, were at $5.532 billion dollars as of the quarter end.", "Let me now talk about our outlook for FY '15.", "As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, all major global currencies depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar. Even in the last 1 week, we have seen similar volatility in global currencies, with the euro depreciating by another 2.5%, Australian dollar depreciating another 0.5 -- 0.9%, and GBP by another 3.1%. We therefore believe that it's prudent not to take a view on the currencies and are maintaining the guidance at 7% to 9% at September 30 rates. These are the same rates that we used for giving our guidance on October 10, 2014. We expect our Q4 operating margins to be in the narrow band of 25%, plus/minus 1%, subject to currency movements.", "With that, I'll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to focus on a couple of things. And the first thing is related to your commentary regarding the financial services vertical. Our survey in December also indicated some challenges there. Pravin, I think it will be helpful if you talk a bit about what's really driving the cautiousness that you're seeing in the financial services part of the business in North America. Our survey talks about much longer sales cycles, much longer [indiscernible]. And I think some color here could help.", "U. B. Pravin Rao", "Thanks, Moshe. I will ask -- request my colleague Mohit Joshi to respond to this.", "Mohit Joshi", "Moshe, I think overall, for financial services, we've had a good quarter, right? And I think we are seeing both broad-based momentum. In the U.S., specifically, I think we are seeing challenges in some clients, especially some of our very large global clients are cutting their IT budget as they come to the New Year. I think it's partly because of the fairly significant fines that have been levied. And obviously, that is having an impact on the technology budgets. But overall, I just want to stress that the themes that we spoke about at our analyst conference, right, which is industrialization, digital and risk and compliance, still continue to be the focus areas. And like Pravin mentioned, we are seeing a pickup in activity in the smaller, the regionals and the super-regionals. So for some of the large banks, especially the very large global banks, they are cutting -- or they are being cautious about expend because of the fines and the need to attain a target return on equity and cost-to-income ratios. So I don't know if that answers your question or if you have any follow-up to this.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "No, this is fine -- sorry, go ahead.", "Vishal Sikka", "Sorry, Moshe, this is Vishal. I would add that digital and especially Big Data continue to be areas that all banks are looking heavily at investing in. So while there are secular pressures on the more traditional services on IT budgets, there are areas that are in significant demand, and therefore, building world-class solutions and competency in those areas -- for example, around reporting, regulatory reporting, risk analytics, digital, is something that we continue to see tremendous interest in. And also, I would like to ask Ravi to comment on this from an insurance perspective.", "Ravi Venkatesan", "Yes. Thanks, Vishal. So the 2 segments I work on is insurance and cards and payments. In insurance, there is a standard refresh cycle, which happens pretty much every 3 years. And as long as we're positioned under the refresh cycles, if we aren't an incumbent, we would gain some of it. So there's a fair bit of refresh, which happens on a regular basis. In addition to that, there is a lot of money spent on risk analytics, telematics and P&C and to a large extent in health insurance, the entire transformation from B2B to B2C. In cards and payments, I think there is a fair bit of legacy infrastructure most card companies carry. And they're actually now transforming themselves into digital wallets and the ability to do payments through mobile devices. So their entire infrastructure is going through a huge renewal, and we are seeing significant uplift of technology spend in that space.", "Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Just as a follow-up guys, you've indicated that your pipeline is robust. I know it's too early to talk about fiscal year 2016, but do you think that it's unrealistic for us to assume that top line growth could improve from 2015 into 2016?", "Vishal Sikka", "Moshe, we will have a better handle on how the strategy that we have laid out will impact quantitatively and what assessment we can therefore give to you in April, as I have said before. My sense is that, if you look longer-term, the more traditional services will continue to see pricing pressure, downward pricing pressure. And therefore, we believe that renewing our existing services to improve automation, to improve productivity through better automation with the use of more artificial intelligence and things like this, is going to continue to be beneficial. And however, at the same time, the next-generation services that are necessary, in almost every industry, there is a tremendous disruption going on. And each -- as far as I can see, all businesses are looking for ways to continually innovate in new areas. And in those areas, we continue to see heavy demand. So our general sense is that whatever downward pressure we see will be more than compensated by the improved productivity that we see due to renewals in our way of delivering these services, as well as the new solutions that we offer. So generally, I continue to be quite optimistic about the future. However, we will share more details about what this could mean quantitatively and what kind of guidance we are looking at when we are together in April. And also, of course, I earlier mentioned the Deutsche Bank example. This is a great example of this particular phenomenon coming to life.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "My first question here is, I wonder if you could give us some idea of how we should think about growth, given the move to new technologies and the new client additions. In other words, will more growth be driven by new clients? And how does these shorter digital projects impact with your standard seasonality is?", "U. B. Pravin Rao", "We do see growth in both existing clients, as well as new clients. There are -- as Vishal talked about the duality, we have opportunity for renewing existing landscapes of our clients, as well. At the same time, we can partner with our clients in terms of transforming their businesses and coming up with -- taking advantage of some of the newer areas like cloud, analytics, Big Data and so on. So we do see growth coming both from mix. We have a lot of opportunities of mining the accounts and growing within that existing client base. At the same time, we also have opportunities for acquiring new accounts and growing those accounts as well.", "Vishal Sikka", "And maybe I can add to that, that generally, the opportunities to the new and existing practices and existing projects, as well as bringing new projects to existing clients is, of course, a huge opportunity. And in parallel, of course, there is a large portion of the global 5,000 that we have not yet penetrated. And we are quite excited about going after that opportunity, both within the United States as well as in other growth markets. And an additional dimension of that, that I want to bring up is I mentioned the $500 million fund that we are adding to our portfolio. I believe that, that is an area of growth as well over the longer term because startup companies in growth areas need help in scaling themselves. And we believe that we can provide that help in bringing them to market and bringing their solutions to scale but also in helping amplify their engineering and development abilities, their operational abilities, as well as then of course participating in their financial success. So we expect that, that will be another dimension of our growth as we go forward.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And maybe you could give as an update on some of the progress you're making on the attrition front and when we can expect to see that rate, I think, come down. I think you'd given earlier targets on attrition. And any color you can give us on the recruiting side and why you think those people may be leaving or coming in.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Joe, could you repeat the question, please? I couldn't catch it.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Yes. I was wondering if you could give as an update on attrition. I think you'd given us targets on when you're planning on getting the rate down before, and any color you can give us on sort of what the personnel is thinking from both an exit and entry standpoint.", "Rajiv Bansal", "I think, while on an ATM basis, attrition was marginally up, but from an absolute headcount perspective, this is the second successive quarter of reduction in number of employees quitting. We had about 12% reduction in number of quits, about roughly 8,900 in quarter 3 versus 10,100 in quarter 2. And again, the quarter 2 -- in quarter 2, it said we had 5% reduction over quarter 1. And also, from a -- if you look at it from a quarterly annualized attrition perspective, we have seen a 3% decrease in attrition. So I think, from a trend perspective, we are comfortable. We believe that many of the things we are doing on the attrition front have slowly started seeing the results. At the same time, we are still not comfortable with where it is today. And we believe that we'll be comfortable with more of 12% to 14% attrition, and we believe this will probably take another couple of quarters before we reach that. But many things that we have taken, I think we are seeing positive impact. [indiscernible] together with the employees in multiple ways, and hopefully, that's employee engagement, communication and outreach activities.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And then the last question from me. I wonder if you could give us an update on just 2 other metrics. Utilization continues to be sort of on the upper end of the scale. What can we expect from that? And what are your thoughts on pricing?", "Rajiv Bansal", "On the utilization front, it's -- [indiscernible], we are looking at about operating around 80% to 82%. Historically, we have operated around 78% to 80%, but this year, we're looking at 80%, 82% and upwards. We still believe that [indiscernible]. But on a quarterly basis, we could see some volatility because in some quarters, we have large influx of trainees coming from campuses, so we could see some lift in utilization. But we are still comfortable with operating at the current trend, and our target is also around this range. On the pricing front, pricing is stable. But at the same time -- and so for some of the traditions which has been in the competitive environment, we are under pressure, particularly on a deal-specific basis. And again, in some -- it also varies based on sectors. In some of the sectors, we have -- or in some of the areas where we are able to come into transformational opportunities or opportunities in newer areas where we're seeing some uptick in pricing -- but by and large, in some of the traditional areas, we are seeing pressure. And more recently, in the energy space, given the developments around oil prices and other things, we are seeing tremendous focus by the clients on cutting costs. And there, we are seeing some increased pressure. But by and large, I would assume it's stable. But we'll continue to -- we'll continue to operate in a competitive market, and we continue to be dialing down pricing, at least on the existing services.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "So first, I wanted to talk about margins, if I could. And the specific question is, if you could talk about the various puts and takes from this from the most recent look quarter-to-quarter, the December quarter, on what impacted margins and specifically address -- I think you mentioned this in the prior call to this one, how much did FX help in terms of the margins? And as you look at the upcoming quarter -- I know you don't want to get into FX prediction business, and I certainly understand that, but this FX rate, for where they are today, if you look at the March quarter, how much help would we get in margins? But also, in the context of not only just FX, but if you could talk about how much pricing is also impacting margins. And then I have a follow-up on revenues, please.", "Vishal Sikka", "Keith, you were breaking in and out, but our sense is that your question is about margin and how do we see this change going forward. Perhaps, Rajiv, you can answer this.", "Rajiv Bansal", "So Keith, let me try. Margins for the quarter went up by 60 basis points, primarily because we saw 2.5% depreciation of rupee during the quarter. Some of it was set off, again, because of the cross-country movement. We also saw operational improvement in terms of our utilization going up to 82.7%, strong volume growth of 4.2%, onsite mix coming down by 20 basis points. So we saw all-around good operational performance which helped us on the margin front. At the same time, we also had operations for the [indiscernible] coming down in the quarter. So these things were helped us on the margin side. At the same time, we invested money back in the business based on whatever benefits we've gotten, operational benefits, in terms of what I spoke about, 5,000 promotions that we rolled out to our employees. We also gave selective hikes to people in certain technology streams and growth industries, in technology and software assets. So our strategy on margin is very straight. We want to keep margins a narrow band. We still have to invest back in the business. We have to accelerate our growth. So we believe a margin of 25% plus/minus 1% is what we will target for the following coming quarters. It may vary quarter-on-quarter depending on the need to make investments. So I would believe that, that's the right margin in the -- for the coming quarters. But at the same time, it may vary quarter-on-quarter depending on when there's an opportunity to make investment and when we will make those investments.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay. Rajiv, I don't know if you can hear me any better now but, as you look at the March quarter, as you think about it, I would assume FX is going to be a help to the March quarter. At the same time, as you're trying to make investments -- so when you say 25%, plus or minus, would you anticipate being above that as you look at the next quarter or so, below that, given the forces of investments combined with FX in pricing in particular?", "Rajiv Bansal", "As I said, during this quarter, we had a benefit of a provision for doubtful debt. If you go to the detailed financial statement, we had a provision for doubtful debt provision last quarter, and this quarter, we had a reversal, which helped us, talking about the 2 basis points of the margins alone between this and that. So there are many headwinds and tailwinds on the margin as we speak on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And it's very difficult for me to give you an exact position of the margin like it will be next quarter, but I would still say the same thing. We believe that 25% plus/minus 1% is the right margin. If there's an opportunity in a business area to make investments, which will help us grow, accelerate in that business, we would make that investment. That reason we're talking about a range, as you know, our growth rates are still far below the industry average. And we want to accelerate our growth. We're investing back in the business, investing in employees, attrition or all the big concerns that we had. We have, over the last 2 or 3 quarters, invested heavily back with the employees, and some of the early results have started showing in terms of attrition coming down. So there's still a lot of ideas for making investments, which are -- which were not made for many, many quarters in the past. And that's the reason I am seeing, though the margins are 26.7% this quarter, I still believe that 25% plus/minus 1% margin is the right margin for the future.", "Vishal Sikka", "And I would add, Keith, that our strategy as a company has always been, as somebody used to say, consistent, profitable growth. And I hope that the last 2 quarters have demonstrated that we are sticking to that. We will do what is necessary to invest in areas that are necessary to grow the company, to grow the business, to transform our various areas of capabilities. But we will stick to that philosophy of consistent, profitable growth. And I think the rest is as Rajiv has already talked about.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay, well, if I could sneak in one to follow up on the revenue side, then. You mentioned that you're investing for future areas, including analytics. I was wondering how long you see the maturity process unfolding. In other words, you're investing in these areas now. When do you think you could see improvement in the top line growth? Is this towards the end of this calendar year? When do you think you'll see some of the benefits associated with the investments that you're making now? And that's it for me.", "Vishal Sikka", "My sense is that, especially in the analytics area, there's an entirely new reality at hand. The industry has sort of, so far, addressed analytics using more traditional proprietary platforms in the enterprise. And I believe that those solutions are no longer adequate for the emerging needs of the enterprises in the future. Therefore, we have been we're working heavily on what we call the Infosys Information Platform, which is a collection of open source-based technologies and projects, which are Hadoop-based, and new emerging projects in this area, which are quite exciting. And we have been investing heavily in this area and working with our clients. We started this work in late September, early October. And we already have 56 projects going on with clients in the area of new kinds of applications on Big Data. I already mentioned banking and risk analytics, risk reporting, regulatory reporting on trades, on massive volumes. We've been working on projects in the areas of predictive maintenance for manufacturing or mining companies. We have been working on projects in the areas of analytics for retail-type companies for fraud detection and things of this nature. So I believe, over time, my expectation is that every single one of our clients is going to be using these technologies. However, specifically, what this will mean in terms of revenue and how we will see the emergence of each project and the monetization of each project, we'll have more to say quantitatively about that in April. But you can see that the approach that we are following has been followed before by other companies in the open source world, the Red Hats and Hortonworks and companies like that, which have basically built enterprise-ready capabilities around open source stacks. And the markets have helped in those kinds of -- value those kinds of things.", "Operator", "Our next question is from James Friedman of SIG.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I wanted to ask first about utilization. How soon, Pravin, might we see the utilization come down towards your targets?", "U. B. Pravin Rao", "I think our -- what we are operating is around the targets, and we're comfortable with the level of utilization because we had said 80% to 82%, we're comfortable. It's slightly above 82%. We are comfortable operating at this level. There are some quarters when we have a large infusion of fresh graduates, the utilization rate dropped down. But we believe the level at which we are operating today is fairly comfortable.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Next question is with regard to the cash position of the company. Could you share with us your updated philosophy with regard to acquisitions or potentially buybacks?", "Vishal Sikka", "We continue to be excited about the possibility to acquire companies. As I have mentioned before, we are very interested in acquiring next-generation capabilities and technologies. We are not interested in acquiring yesterday's capabilities and technologies. These would be -- next-generation things would be things like artificial intelligence and automation, new ways to do collaboration across boundaries, new design-oriented technologies and services, capabilities of that sort. There's a tremendous emerging world of industry photo [ph] and sensors and so forth and rethinking the product engineering world with digital technology. So we are quite excited about that area, and we are actively looking for great opportunities that we could use to bolster our capabilities. Beyond M&A -- so you should expect to hear from us over the next weeks and months as we make progress on these dimensions. Beyond M&A, we are quite excited, once again, as I've said before, about the investment fund that we are launching to invest in startup companies and participate in their growth, both financially as well as from a business perspective. And we expect to take better utilization of our cash towards that dimension as well. Beyond that, we are working through these details. In fact, these days, tomorrow, we have an offsite on these topics. So over the next 80-or-so-odd days, we're going to continue to define and quantify our aspirations and our expectations and so forth, including our capital allocation plans and things like that, and we look forward to sharing that with you with the April earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ravi Menon [ph] of Lion [ph] Securities.", "Unknown Analyst", "I just had 2 questions here. One, you obviously elaborated a lot about the Infosys Information Platform. But if you could give some more color on the [indiscernible], that'll be great. And secondly, on -- where do you regard this goes, [ph] the option at Finacle and the recent benchmark test that you did as indicators for accelerating adoption in the U.S. for midsized banks?", "Vishal Sikka", "Could you repeat your first question on IIP? I could hear it was about the IIP but not what the question was.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes, the size of the projects. If you could give some color on that, that would be great.", "Vishal Sikka", "Across the industry, there are about 56 projects right now, a little bit more than 56 right now, then, across industries and across geographies. They are for various different kinds of problems. Some are extensions of existing work we have been doing with clients. Some are -- mostly are completely new. Some are being tried based on value that is delivered by the project, some based simply on the effort required. So we want to see how this evolves. We expect that, over the course of this quarter that we are now in, in Q4, we will conclude several handfuls of these projects. And then we'll have a better ability to identify which buckets various projects fall under. And -- but the way we are treating these is these are new-generation projects. These are extremely agile projects where we deliver value to clients very, very quickly. We do 4-week POCs, 8- to 10-week projects and so forth. And they are of relatively high value. So beyond that, it is too early to tell in any kind of a meaningful, quantitative way what nature these projects will have. And on Finacle, I would like to ask Michael, who is the head of our Finacle, to answer the question.", "Michael Reh", "This is Michael speaking. So basically, on Finacle, we had a good quarter. In general, we -- or the business recorded a quarter-over-quarter growth. We had 18 wins and 20 go-lives across the different regions of EMEA, America and APAC. I guess, more importantly, the momentum is getting better. We are seeing a good uptick in our demand, particularly in the Western markets. The banks who have delayed their modernization programs in the last few years due to the lack of budgets and limited appetite for especially large transformational programs are now actively exploring these kind of options. And today, we are very well placed with our services and our advanced platform. You might have seen the announcement coming out from the analysts. Finacle has been awarded as being the leader in the metric quadrant from Gartner. And also, recently, we have released our performance benchmark, which basically means that we have broken a world record in the number of transactions we are processing. And the excitement about that is that the number of volumes we are able to process is exceeding 5x the entire volume of payments we are seeing in the entire U.S. market right now.", "Operator", "Next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question around your innovation fund, how you're going to manage any conflicts, both internally on deciding what technologies to work with and externally, not having groups see you line up with another firm and so forth. How are you -- how will you work through those conflicts?", "Vishal Sikka", "Well, we are a -- purely a services company. We have lived, for the last 33, 34 years, on this idea of being open to every single choice that customers have made, and so the more, the merrier. And as I have -- many of you perhaps have heard me argue before, I would love to be in situations where we have this great problem of multiple, competing technologies and solutions to the same problem. I think that kind of a situation to be in is a wonderful situation to be in, and we look forward to being more and more in that kind of situation. But seriously, I say that with a tongue in cheek, but openness is the -- is what it is all about. Assembly of great solutions out of many, many different possibilities is something great to look forward to. And we will never see a situation where choices like that hamper our ability to deliver great value to clients.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My other question is, on the earlier call, you mentioned the desire to move utilization up to the sort of 83%, 84% level. Is that part of what's necessary to maintain operating margin around 25%, given the ongoing pressure on the traditional offerings?", "Vishal Sikka", "My sense of it is that I don't think so. My sense of it is that, originally, when I started here, of course, this was all new to me. So it was somewhat of a desire to see how far can we go and how high can this go. And our sense is -- Ravin, of course, has been at this for a long time, and our sense is that there is still headroom here. We see that more as a sign of a healthy operational efficiency in the company to see how high you go. Of course, there is -- there are structural limits here that we are running into, the amount of time people have to take on vacations and training and then other factors that apply. So how are margins, there are lots of other factors that contribute to margin as well. This will be one of these but certainly not the only one. We are burgeoning the productivity, the value delivered, new kinds of business models, IP-based products and so forth and other contributors to revenue productivity and to margin. And again, as I mentioned earlier, if you strictly look at the revenue per FTE that we have delivered, that number has gone up from $52,300 per employee at the end of Q2 for the last 12 months leading up to the end of Q2 to now $52,700 per employee at the end of this last quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Matt on for Anil. I was just curious about kind of -- you speak about these technologies of yesterday and then the emerging technologies. Could you kind of give us a breakdown of, percentage-wise, of the revenue that would still be yesterday's and then the percentage that is new and then kind of the growth that is coming with both of those buckets?", "Vishal Sikka", "Not yet, Matt, and that's something that we are working through and that we will share with you in April. I have to say that, when we say renewal of our existing services, that means bringing automation, bringing innovation to all the existing services that we deliver today, whether it is business process outsourcing, business process management, IMS or infrastructure management, our verification service, package implementations, product engineering, application development and maintenance. All of these existing services can be significantly improved, productivity can be improved by the use of -- better use of automation, bringing in new technologies into these existing services. So it is all about taking the existing services that we have in offering the bread-and-butter services and helping transform these incrementally without disruption to the business as we go. When I say yesterday's services, I basically mean unrenewed service of today. So we are really closer into renewing all of our services, and we have no interest in leaving any of our services unrenewed, per se. So it is -- and then the new things are, of course, completely new things that we don't offer today, that we did not offer until recently, and that is an additional area of growth that we foresee. But how this will break down and which part do we expect to contribute, what, this we will share more details in April.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then can you just provide a little update on the -- just the overall competitive landscape and kind of the competition that you're seeing throughout the different parts of your business?", "Rajiv Bansal", "We see competition both from global websites as well as some of our large India peers. But at the same time, in some of the newer areas, we're also seeing competition, particularly in the areas of digital, we are also seeing competition from agencies. In some of the other areas, we are seeing competition from some of the startups. So in general -- but by and large, as far as from our traditional services, the competition remains the same. But in new areas, we do see competition from startups, digital agencies and so on.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rishi Jhunjhunwala of Goldman Sachs.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions from my side. Firstly, on the attrition side, we've clearly seen a downtick in the attrition rates in this quarter. Just wanted to understand how much of that is related to the quarterly aberration because this is a quarter where the attrition is seasonally lower and how much is on the back of the various measures that you've taken. And as a result of those measures that you have been talking about earlier in the call, as well, how has that impacted your overall employee cost, because that seems to be pretty much flat on a quarter-on-quarter basis?", "Vishal Sikka", "I believe that -- I guess, the question was about attrition and the lowering of the attrition rate. We believe that the many initiatives that we have taken that both Rajiv and Pravin talked about, as well as I talked about, are showing results as we have expected. Many of these decisions that people take tend to be longstanding decisions that they have already taken several months ago. So we see sort of a residual momentum of these. We definitely want this to improve further, and we want the attrition levels to come down to these 12% to 14%, 15% ranges that are more common in the industry. And we expect that will continue over the next couple of quarters, in the next couple or 3 quarters. The month-by-month as well as the quarter-by-quarter actual numbers have come down significantly, and that is something that we see as an encouraging sign. But clearly, some -- we don't want 8,900 people or something to the tune of that leaving every quarter, and we want this number to continue to come down.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The second question is on -- you've been talking, Vishal, about automation and artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies. Just wanted to understand how far is an outsourcing IT services company is from having these kind of technologies being -- contributing prominently to the overall revenue growth. The reason I ask is just trying to understand as to how much of the capability acquiring is going to come from internal development of skills of some employees and how much may potentially come from direct M&A.", "Vishal Sikka", "I didn't catch the last part of your question. How much -- what was the 2 different options that you mentioned?", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Internal development of skills in the employee base versus M&A.", "Vishal Sikka", "My sense is -- I mean, this is still very early. I mentioned we have around 12 or so of these what we could call purely AI-based projects that are going on. These are awesome and very exciting. We are working on, for example, testing the structure of an airframe of an aircraft under extreme pressure using neural network technology. Or we are building, for one client in detail, building up a holistic network to detect fraud in transactions and things of this nature, which are extremely exciting and high-value and necessary for the future. But I think we have to keep in mind that these are 12 projects out of more than 20,000 projects that we have going on in the company right now. And so it is even too early to tell how quickly these things will start to have what kind of an effect. And we expect to have a more precise and quantitative answer for you for these types of things in April. The other part, about acquiring these skills from inside versus outside, we expect to see a mix of that. My tendency right now is, again, this is too early to tell, and you want to be very open and nimble on it. This isn't like this whenever you see something that makes sense, you want to be able to -- you want to be in a position where you can quickly move to acquire it. But having said that, my sense is that over a longer term, much more of this will be done organically. And our sense is that M&A will complement that rather than having M&A be the basis to build this kind of a thing on. And we have put together a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence class in our Mysore Campus as well as in our DCs. A little bit more than 1,000 people have already taken that class. These are the ones that we are putting on some of these projects around machine learning and things like this. And we expect that we'll train 500 people on these technologies every quarter going forward. That means that the kind of scale that we can achieve in building competency in this area, organically, will continue to be quite substantial.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a very quick follow-up. If I remember correctly, you had -- Infosys had entered into a partnership, as well, with one of the companies which does develop artificial intelligence. I think it was IPsoft. I'm just trying to understand, is that partnership going anywhere, or just trying to look at building it internally?", "Rajiv Bansal", "We have not really found much traction in the partnership, so we are building that capability internally. We have -- we already have a platform for automation, and we have seen some decent tractions both on the application maintenance, as well as the infrastructure management space. And we will continue to invest in that platform.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the floor back over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call and spending time with us. We look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. On behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. [Operator Instructions]", "Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo. Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, [Imba] [ph]. Hello, everyone. And welcome to Infosys' earnings call to discuss Q4 and FY15 financial results. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka, along with other members of the leadership team.", "We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, along some comments on the fiscal 2016. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thank you, Sandeep. Hello, friends. As I speak to you today, we close the rewarding year but a disappointing quarter. Rajiv and I will address the details of the financial performance during the course of this call and I want to take a few minutes first to outline my thoughts on the year behind us and our outlook for the road ahead of us.", "We find the external environment to be one where concerns related to currency, energy and other things as well as technological disruptions have created a sense of volatility. However, I believe that these are not structural issues and that despite these a company that is focused on innovation and efficiency can achieve great results.", "I believe that the traditional model of IT services is dying, but business will continue to look for partners who can help them grow and innovate, who can help them renew their operations and their businesses, and will do so in reliable and agile ways.", "Since I took over a CEO a little more than eight months ago, it has become clear to me that we have weaknesses in sales and other processes, and our delivery culture sometimes lack proactive innovations.", "However, I have also found that we have strength that more than outweighs these challenges. We have immense ability to educate and to learn, perhaps the best in the world. And we have a deep organizational desire to change and improve ourselves, as well as we have ability to recruit the best talent and to house them an exemplary client centric teams and infrastructure that is massively scalable. It is this strength that gives me the confidence in our strategy and despite the weaknesses to turn all our aspirations into commitments.", "It is clear that in our operations especially in sales we need to execute better and we will, both to improve existing operations and to bring new solutions to market. Our recent organizational realignment has freed up senior management -- senior segment leaders to focus exclusively on client relationships and business development. So we continue to make a little changes as necessary to further strength our ability to execute and delivery on our aspirations, which is industry-leading profitable growth by financial year 2017.", "We have launched some specific initiatives to execute against our renew and new strategy, we are rethinking all our client facing functions, we are doing this by streamlining our sales functions, our unifying delivery and by redesigning our other fee and oral processes, among other things, by establishing systematic innovation as an imperative in every project that we deliver.", "We have put together what is possibly the largest ever training program in design thinking. Since October 2014, about 25,000 Infosys employees have been trained on design thinking through a one day immersive class.", "We have launched a zero destination from innovation projects that every single project manager has been given a specific pipeline innovation agenda to bring innovation to their project. More than 1,700 of our projects already followed this.", "We are accelerating our product, Finacle and Edge and our platform, Infosys Information Platform, Infosys Automation Platform and Panaya businesses. We established a new leadership structure from the products and platform businesses, and as a result of this focus, Finacle saw 14.2% constant currency growth quarter-over-quarter and Edge also saw significant growth.", "Finacle sustained its business momentum with 23 wins and 11 go-lives in the quarter, including our Standard Bank in South Africa and Qantas Credit Union in Australia. On Edge we had 12 wins and three client go-lives during the quarter.", "In the short duration of less than two quarters we have more than 100 active projects going with clients who are using IIT. We have see pilots have already been completed where pilot is an agile one taking about three to five weeks to close and four of these are already in full production. In addition, 17 contracts are in the final stages of being executed with IIT.", "On Infosys Automation Platform, which is our platform capabilities for bringing automation to our existing services and infrastructure management has been deployed already in nine projects and has a pipeline of 31.", "We are able to show almost 40% productivity improvements in deployment with IAT. Infosys also now has a strong AI practice which have seen a spike in the number of artificial intelligence project over the last eight months, especially in engineering and finance, where we have proven success in providing solutions to complex and diverse problems.", "We are especially proud of our relations with Boeing, where we have been working in partnership on knowledge-based engineering to develop software tools using artificial intelligence with the objective of reducing flow time in the aircraft development process. I believe that we can bring this notion of knowledge-based engineering to lots of enterprise landscape we have seen.", "Syngenta, a world leader in agribusiness, had application performance challenges in their Management Reporting because of large volume of data. Infosys did a Proof of Concept with using IIT to improve its performance by 12 to 60 times.", "Also at Syngenta, the Infosys Automation Platform was use to automate SAP user authorization requests and improve user productivity through speedy closure of authorization requests.", "Syngenta also went live with the TradeEdge Dealer Management System in the last quarter to manage distributors in two states in India. This will be rolled out to distributors across other states, as well as other countries in the region over the course of next year.", "With Panaya which we acquired during Q4, we are seeing up to 50% productivity improvement in testing. At ABB in Brazil we saved 30% on testing time, at Inchcape we saved 50% in testing, integration and documentation effort, and at Coca-Cola Israel or CBC we completed their six months project within 2.5 months and at Royal Resort, we saved them 73% of effort in the heavy development effort.", "We are transforming Infosys consulting to be the tip of our spear. We have consolidated our various consulting units under a single global leadership. In the last few months, we have completed more than 20 client engagements in design thinking and have a pipeline of more than 100 additional ones.", "And outstanding success with design thinking has been the transformation of our relationships with RWE, one of the largest utility companies in Europe. Peter Terium, the CEO of RWE, has said this and I quote, \u201cOur company and in fact our entire industry is in the midst of a massive transformation. Given the scale of the market disruption, RWE has started our innovation journey more than two years ago. In this changed journey our interactions with Infosys on design thinking have already yielded great value by increasing the scope of what we even thought was possible. I look further to an increasingly strategic and collaborative partnership between our companies in Silicon Valley and around the globe.\u201d", "We announced 100% bonus payout in Q2 and Q3, which I believe has helped to retain good talent, because of this and several additional measures that we have taken for employee engagement, I\u2019m very happy to report that our employee attrition has been contained.", "In May 2014, the month before I was announced, we had 2,850 exits of people from the company. In July, we had 2,528. This year in January, we\u2019ve had 1,760 in exits, 1,437 in February and 1,352 in March. This number has come down by more than half since May of last year. And we are opening new frontiers to our business with a unique approach to investment, M&A, startups and with our sound and million dollar investment fund.", "As a result of all of these initiatives, I believe also that the client confidence in Infosys has increased. I personally met more than 500 clients and more than 170 one-on-one meetings and I sense their excitement to be associated and engage with Infosys.", "Some example from this last quarter: House of Fraser, a leading retailer in the U.K., and part of a Sanpower Group in China selected Infosys to deliver a strategic rebuild transformation program, bringing advanced technologies to their multi-channel business.", "ABN AMRO selected Infosys as one of its strategic partners to drive its business transformation. Infosys will deliver services across application development and maintenance, testing and product implementation in the entire lifecycle.", "Western Union Financial Services have selected us for an 11-year turnkey project where we take end-to-end ownership to modernize, maintain and support their worldwide settlement systems.", "Today, we also announced two strategic investments. We have taken a stake in an exciting startup, Airviz in the Internet of Things area and we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Skava, whose mobile commerce tooling platform is used by leading retailers in the United States.", "I would now like to talk briefly about our performance in the quarter that ended on 31st of March, the lessons that we have learned and the actions that we are taking. We closed the last quarter of fiscal 2015 at $2.159 billion in reported currency and $2.208 billion in constant currency. So naturally, I\u2019m disappointed that we could not do better compared to the guidance that we have provided for the year, despite the promising first three quarters.", "I\u2019m pleased of course that our cost structures have stabilized and we are able to balance the investments and profitability while returning higher dividends to investors and Rajiv will talk about the dividend, as well as the bonus share matters in his presentation.", "Thanks to our operational efficiency initiatives, the operating margin of the company has significantly improved from 23.5% in fiscal 2014 to 25.7% in Q4 of fiscal 2015. We will continue our progress on improving utilization on eliminating, on reducing on-site employee cost as a percentage of revenue and in bringing more agility into our business enabling functions.", "This is vital to generating the cash flows required to invest into our renew and new strategies. The positive momentum, coupled with the corrective measures that I have outlined will help us recover the loss of momentum that we saw in Q4 2015.", "Our year-on-year guidance for financial year \u201916 is growth in the range of 10% to 12% at constant currency. The mission of our management team is to prepare the company to achieve an aspirational goal of $20 billion in revenue by 2020, with at least 30% in operating margins.", "New services have been designed thinking AI and the intellectual property oriented services work will contribute. We expect approximately 10% of revenue. We expect our inorganic investment strategies to influence approximately $1.5 billion of new revenue and we will increase our revenue per employee with $80,000 by deploying automation and innovation in existing businesses.", "We expect to generate at least 30% productivity improvements in our existing service lines from these solutions. New platforms in our Edge portfolio work on different revenue models and will contribute disproportionately to our revenue proportion.", "Our goal is to bring attrition levels down to the lowest in the industry and to achieve at least 25% in diversity in our top leadership. Our aspiration is to make Infosys a great place to work, attracting the best talents in the industry globally.", "I\u2019m confident that the steps that we are taking will get us there. It will get us back to being the bellwether of our industry, to being a next-generation services company, one that delivers innovation for the world that is being fundamentally reshaped by computing technology.", "Let me now hand this over to Rajiv for his comments and I will come back for the Q&A session after that. Thank you.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Vishal and hello everyone. We ended financial year \u201915 with revenue of $8.711 billion, year-on-year growth of 5.6%. On a constant currency basis, based on FY \u201814 average rates, we grew by 7.1%.", "If you recollect, we had given the guidance of 7% to 9% in April, based on March 31, 2014 rates. Based on those rates, we grew by 7.7%. The revised guidance was 7% to 9% based on September 30th exchange rates and we have grown by 6.5% based on those exchange rates.", "We have delivered an EPS growth of 15% year-on-year on a revenue growth of 5.6%. I believe we have done exceedingly well on the margin front in FY \u201815. Our operating margin for the year improved by 190 basis points on a reported basis and 240 basis points on a constant currency basis.", "We offered wage hike to all employees [indiscernible] 2014, after 25,000 promotions which we did during the year. We increased our average variable payout of our employees from 64% in FY \u201814 to 86% in FY \u201815. We also did mid-year wage hike for a particular number of our employees effective October 1, 2014.", "We also increased our investment in training and employee engagement, all being held up to bring down the annualized attrition from 23.4% in Q1 to 13.4% in Q4. We have been able to show remarkable improvements in the operating margins because of our focus on improving operational efficiencies through onsite-offshore mix, which has come down from 30.6% last year to 28.8% in FY \u201815.", "Utilization excluding trainings went up from 76.4% to 80.9% during the year. Pricing though has been under pressure and has declined by 2.8% year-on-year on reported basis and 1.4% on constant currency basis.", "So, we\u2019ve done exceedingly well on year-on-year operation parameters and margins. Fourth quarter revenues have declined by 2.6% on a reported basis and 0.4% on a constant currency basis.", "Pricing continues to be under pressure and has seen a decline during the quarter by 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Our utilization has declined by 410 basis points to 78.6% during the quarter.", "Our operating margins for the quarter was 25.7%, a sequential decline of 100 basis points. But if you look at the constant impact, the impact was about 70 basis points on the Q4 margins.", "So on a normalized basis, the margins have dropped by about 30 basis points. We added about 14,471 employees throughout during the quarter, with a net addition of 6,549 employees. We have rolled out an average wage hike of 6.5% for our employees in India and 2% for our employees outside of India.", "Including promotions and other benefits, the increases will be on an average 7.5% to 8% for India and 2.5% for employees outside India. This is in addition to the mid-year hike that we rolled out in October for a number of our people.", "The Board has recommended a bonus issue of one equity share for every equity share held and a stock dividend of one American Depository Shares for every ADS held as on a record date to be determined.", "We did some of it, if you look at our capital allocation and cash deployment policy in line with the company strategy of new and renew that Vishal has articulated. We did our planning in financial model for the next five years and as they become integral part of our strategy and as such, we would like to allocate a significant part of incremental cash flows to it.", "We also need to make significant investments in infrastructure and in technology assets. Therefore, we need to spend 50% of our incremental cash flows on M&A and investment. Keeping this in mind, we recommend to the Board an increase in dividend payout to 50% from the current 40% of our post-tax profits.", "This implies the final dividend of 29.50 rupees per share for fiscal 2015, equivalent to 14.75 rupees per share after 1:1 bonus issue. This translates to a final dividend in dollar terms of $0.47 per share pre-bonus and $0.24 per share post bonus.", "The Board accepted the same subject to the shareholders approval in the AGM. The increase in dividend payout will negatively impact our FY \u201816 EPS by $0.01 due to lower non-operating income. Our yield on non-operating income was at 9.04% compared to 9.24% in Q3. These are likely to decline further during the next financial year due to the softening of interface in India.", "Our effective tax rate would continue to be in a narrow range of 28% to 29% for the next year. During the year, we spent $11 million -- we spent $42 million towards CSR activities and $11 million during the quarter.", "Our cash and cash equivalents was $5.2 billion as of the March 31, 2015. Our cash and cash equivalent declined in Q4 account of $221 million towards acquisition of Panaya and making investments in Nova, payment of $560 million towards taxes, which included a tax demand from outside of India for [indiscernible] in 2010 and 2011. The same has been paid and we have filed an appeal with income tax turbulence, CapEx of about $106 million.", "Our DSO in the quarter increased by four days, which also impacted our working capital. We are guiding for 10% to 12% constant currency growth at FY \u201816. Our FY \u201816 growth is impacted by 380 basis points due to adverse cross currency movement in the year and therefore on a reported basis, we are guiding for revenue growth of 6.2% to 8.2%.", "While we have done exceedingly well versus potentially improving our operating margin for FY \u201815, we continue to make investments to accelerate our growth. We\u2019ve already provided an operating margin band of 25%, plus-minus 1% raising the currency rate at that time. However, as we note during the last two quarters, most of the currencies have depreciated significantly under the U.S. dollar and has negatively impacted our operating margins to 100 basis points.", "Despite that, we would like to retain the margin band that we had given earlier. However, operating margins may continue to be volatile quarter on quarter. As in every year, the first quarter will see the impact on increase in salaries, promotions and investment in new reserves. I expect the first quarter operating margin to be impacted by about 250 basis points.", "With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I wonder if I could ask sort of -- couple of high level questions but it seems like you feel like the industry in the basic old services model is, I think, you had said dying. First, on the revenue growth side, what produces upside and are those coming from different areas than what we typically used to? Are those coming from newer initiatives as opposed to the basic application development and maintenance stuff? So I\u2019m wondering how you are reorganizing the business to go after those newer areas and what\u2019s driving the upside there?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "It\u2019s a great question, Joseph. So there are two parts to that. There is a renew part to that which is basically where we want to -- where we are endeavoring to make our existing services for the existing businesses that they cater to, more comparative and more productive by bringing in automation, by bringing in new technology into those businesses. An example of that is the worst that for example, happens in upgrading packet systems or implementing packets.", "We recently did a large deal there. We brought some IR into our traditional SAP practice and we won a large deal where we will do the upgrade and implementation in management projects of this SAP landscape. This is an example where you take a traditional people in terms of kind of a project offer and replace that with lesser number of people, perhaps to a higher price but augment that with a software which is much higher margin. And yes you have two things, the revenue -- the cost to the customer goes down but the margin goes up. And you save people to put on additional projects.", "So this is the kind of transformation that we see on the existing business. And in parallel, the new areas have fundamentally higher value, higher margin kind of areas. This is where we build complex applications for complex problem using new platform like the work with IIP, the Infrastructure Information Platform or the design thinking engagement. There we basically work with clients on identifying their next generation problem and then working on rapid solutions for that.", "These are the kinds of things that are higher value. They are typically served to new lines of businesses whether it is marketing of sales or strategy. And so they are high value, high margin projects. However, as I mentioned earlier, we have approximately 250 of these types of engagement goings but this compares to more than 30,000 projects that we have in the traditional business. So this will take some time to become a material revenue driver. So in the meantime, the revenue has to come from a significant improvement in the productivity and in the differentiation of the existing stuff that we do. Does that make sense?", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. It does make sense. I guess, the second question and this has, sort of, been one that some of your predecessors have gotten before. Given your high level of profitability and the fact that there seems like there is significant headwinds including pricing pressure, over a longer period of time. Why not adjust the margin profile lower in the short term until those new projects that you\u2019re working on can kick in and provide productivity? Why try to maintain that level of profitability when clearly it seems like people are resetting the bar at a lower price point?", "Rajiv Bansal", "We have done our analysis and it is not that the margins are impacting our growth. If we recollect about a year back, our margins dropped about 23.5% but that didn\u2019t deserve higher growth for us. We continue to make investments if it is required. We have a very flexible investment policy. The priority is to accelerate the growth of the business. And whatever the investment needs are, they are being fulfilled proactively and on a case-to-case basis.", "So these things -- and the reason why we give them margin band and we\u2019ve started giving margin band for last three, four quarters, precisely for that reasons so that we wanted the flexibility to be able to make investments as and when the opportunity arises. So I think we are absolutely aligned. But we need to make investments to accelerate our growth. But it\u2019s not that the margin is impacting our ability to do -- make the investments.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then the last one from me, just specifically on pricing, we\u2019ve heard a lot of different commentary on pricing. Some look at it as stable, some look at it as declining. I like to get to a sort of your view on what pricing is doing but not just in the short term but over the long term. And if it\u2019s impacting those 30,000 projects that you described, maybe you could address that versus a long-term margin profile?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So maybe Joseph I can start and Pravin, if you can add something. In the short term, we see a tremendous pricing pressure coming. And I don\u2019t think this is something that is temporary. I think this is a flexible thing that is going to impact the way the services have been done. It creates what I have in the past referred to as a downward spiral where cost continually come down and we become increasingly competitive in yesterday\u2019s model, not realizing that we are, in fact, could use that analogy, bunch of horse-carts trying to compete with an automobile.", "And in this case, automation is taking over major parts of the business. It has to. It is a natural order of things. We have to embrace that. We have to embrace the situation that people become the managers of exception than operators of the automation rather than operator of the system. We have to evolve towards that.", "And on profitability, I think longer term and you think about this, you realize that as they evolve towards that kind of a model, the people become much more productive and able to deal with these kinds of processes and automation. Then our, in fact, margins don\u2019t need to suffer because we can continually bring a combination of people and software to the services world and augment and amplify people\u2019s ability with software.", "So I see this very clearly and I see that this is a irrevocable trend and we have to embrace that because if we don\u2019t, then we will get this update and you had already see that happening in the industry and in the results that you have seen recently.", "Joseph Foresi", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Yes. I had a few if I could. The first one relates to the previous question, but you are anticipating constant currency growth in this current fiscal year of 10% to 12%, which is meaningfully above what you\u2019ve consistently generated during the past fiscal year, including this quarter. What\u2019s the bridge that enables you to get to constant currency growth of 10% to 12% this year, because many of those activities you just described in the previous question I think are longer-term objectives, but I am curious how you bridge this year?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "They are, but, I mean, as I mentioned in this example, and we saw several examples, some of those I outlined during my preamble, where the complement -- where the addition of automation has resulted in results already where we can monetize the software and the reason of our people working on project and thereby make the overall offer more competitive.", "We see that happening in bids already. We see that happening in projects already. And my sense is that in the early part of the year, it is all -- based on the pipeline and the outlook that we see, it is all about execution, efficiency, and getting our job done. And as we evolve towards the second half of the year, more and more effects of this automation, more and more effects of the new -- as well as the some of the new kinds of project will start to contribute to the revenue. So we see the 10% constant currency achievement as being not that far off from what we have already done if you look at over the last few quarters.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Then Rajiv if I could transition to you. You mentioned perhaps the 250 basis points impact to margins in Q1. I wasn\u2019t sure what the source of, is it just the volume variance, or is that investment? And should we still be thinking even with 250 basis points, you have been talking about 25 basis points plus or minus, is that still the right average for the year, which means you end significantly higher than that?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. This is true [indiscernible]. Every year, the first quarter, every IT company with drop in margin because of employee wage hike, promotion, and including visas, and typically the impact is about 250 basis points. And as these impacts and the growth starts coming into second quarter when we start hiring people from the colleges, the average per capita costs started dropping again during the year and the margins are going up. And these are investments typically in the first quarter and not there in the subsequent quarters. So that\u2019s the reason of first quarter margins typically lower and we end up -- exit rates are pretty high.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. But it still is the right thought process to equal 25 basis -- excuse me 25% operating margins plus or minus for the year?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Yes. So as we said, we had given about 25% plus minus 1% earlier. We have seen a cross currency impact of about 100 basis points. But considering what we are seeing after the very impact of pricing and other things, we still believe that 25% plus minus 1 is achievable next year.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. And the last one for me just the consulting, I think you said it\u2019s the tip of the spear and yet many of the consulting areas seemed to be a bit slow. How do you plan on differentiating INFY\u2019s consulting activities as you look at the next 1 to 2 years with a bit of a challenging economic environment still have at least to the growth objective that you\u2019ve identified?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Keith, our history with consulting has been checkered one and it has primarily been based around package systems and providing services, more tactical services around package systems. My sense is that consulting has to evolve towards a tip of the spear where we can have a strategic dialogue with customers and where their business is going and use that as the basis to create a more overarching and more holistic engagement with the client.", "We see that happening already. I mentioned that we have a tangible pipeline of more than 100 of these design thinking projects. As we speak right now, we have two clients in our Palo Alto office, one a large logistics company and one a very large CPG company. Both American companies sitting with our team in Palo Alto and Stanford, working on identifying important strategic problem for them with our consulting team as well as with our design team.", "And so that kind of a transcended of the traditional known business towards one where you can have a strategic dialogue, it will create a high value even if it is a small project that is a high margin project, but it creates a strategic engagement at the very top of the client and then that provides the ability to get downstream revenue from the more traditional projects, because you are engaged at the very top.", "So that is one part of it. And on the traditional package system part of it what we are working on is a few very crisply defined packages or templates where we can renew the existing system landscape of our customers around ERP system, around this knowledge-based engineering type work where our teams can start to transcend the packages and instead start to engage on solving the business problems no matter what package is used.", "So we are carrying out this transformation. Sanjay Purohit is our new head of consulting and he is carrying out this transformation as we speak. And it is driven primarily by evolving into a strategic consulting organization where we work on the next generation projects as a basis to drive also the projects hearing now. Does that make sense?", "Keith Bachman", "Yes, it does. Okay. All right. Thanks very much, gentlemen. And best of luck to you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Thanks. Congratulations on the significant contraction and attrition rates. I think that was pretty impressive. There is definitely lot of skepticism Vishal over the guidance for fiscal year 2016. So if it\u2019s possible, I just want to ask a couple of questions in that regard and maybe it\u2019s going to clarify some questions. First of all, is there any M&A contribution factored into that 10% to 12% constant currency growth guidance?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Hey, Moshe, no, there is not, only the ones that we have already acquired so that would be the Panaya acquisition as well as what we announced today, the Skava acquisition which is a small. So if we were to do any bigger acquisition that would make a change to this and we would then modify the guidance to include that. So this 10% to 12% does not include the guidance.", "Moshe Katri", "So would Panaya be adding about 100 basis points or so of growth?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, I see -- you see when we acquired Panaya, we acquired multiples of about six times and now we have some aggressive plans with Panaya in terms of the revenue growth this year, but we would not want to share the numbers separately for Panaya this year and going forward.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "But it is not a lot of amount, it\u2019s a small amount, below right.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. And then -- please go ahead, sir.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Moshe, if I might -- if I might add the -- if you look at 10% as the baseline there, it is not that difficult to see how we could get there given the areas of focus that I have talked about. It basically averages out to, what if you do a quarter-on-quarter model of the growth on the quarter-on-quarter basis, the uniform rate that will be 2.8% quarter-on-quarter growth over four quarters. So it is not significantly different from what we have done before. What we did want is 2.4 in the last.", "Rajiv Bansal", "If you look at in FY'15 on a constant currency basis, our sequential growth rate for four quarters was close to an average of 2.4% and I think guidance of 10% to 12% constant currency, it came between 2.8% to 3.5%. So it is going up from 2.4% to 2.8% at the lower end of the guidance.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. And that\u2019s fair. And then maybe it\u2019ll be helpful if we can understand what happened during the quarter? Vishal, you spoke about loss of momentum. You spoke about a disappointment. Is there anything that happens throughout the quarter, January, February, March that kind of got you guys to that disappointment? Was there any sort of issue with specific clients, specific verticals, project ramp? Any color there, I think will be helpful because people are looking at the exit of Q4 and that's why I think there is -- that scepticism about getting to that inflection point to get to that acceleration?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yeah. So, I mean we did see -- we entered the quarter with a higher expectation of volume and as a result, you see also the utilization has come down between that and the pricing. We did see significant ramp down, as well as -- just slowdown economically in many industries beyond energy and telecom. We also saw in other areas slowdown, maybe Praveen, you can talk about this.", "Pravin Rao", "At the beginning of the quarter, we had a decent pipeline and in fact, we did recruit people for our expected pipeline and planned utilization. We did anticipate slowdown and not because of oil prices but our pipeline in other vertical seems to be decent. But across the board, we saw performance of projects, planned ramp ups didn\u2019t happen and we lost a couple of deals a well. So it\u2019s a combination of things. We can\u2019t ascribe it to a single vertical because if you look at it, almost all the segments have grown. So this was something, which we didn\u2019t anticipate in the beginning. We are looking at the topline.", "But as Vishal said, when we look forward, the pipeline continues to be decent. We have many initiatives in place to improve the sales productivity. We are focusing a lot on better qualification of deals. We are focusing a lot on increasing the conversion data of slot deals and some of the initiatives around productivity and all, we believe will help us in improving the win rate. We are also focusing a lot more on managing the accounts better. Some of our top accounts have not really grown. So there are a bunch of initiatives and looking at the pipeline, we feel fairly confident that if we execute well, we should be able to reach our guidance.", "Moshe Katri", "So it\u2019s a mix of execution and the environment, is that what it is?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yeah. Exactly.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. Last question on pricing. Which part is it? The pricing pressure -- which part of the business is it affecting the most? And is it predominantly on renewals of legacy deals or this is pricing on new deals that are coming on board?", "Pravin Rao", "It\u2019s both. I mean if you look at -- I mean other than renewal, I would like to characterize it as -- in the business IT operations space, when you are looking at the infrastructure management, application development maintenance, quality assurance, so that business has become commoditized. So there is tremendous pricing pressure. So it could be renewal of your existing deals or it could even new deals. We had new talks for that. So there is tremendous pressure there, so definitely we are seeing pressure.", "In other areas, I mean, when you look at package implementation or when you look at some of the newer areas like analytics channel, while it\u2019s a competitive situation but there we are able to get better pricing because of the tools we have, because of the capability we have and so on. But a big part of the pressure is on the commoditized, on the business IT operations that of the business. And as Vishal said in the beginning, actual achievements has happened in the industry or the segment is commoditized. So we don\u2019t expect that situation to change.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Omkar Hadkar of Edelweiss. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Agarwal", "Hi. This is Sandeep here from Edelweiss. Thanks for the opportunity. So, I have couple of questions. One, I think you have already answered a part of it but just wanted to know bit more. The way we are looking at the automation part and the artificial intelligence part, I think it will take some more time before it can become meaningful.", "And in the meantime, you already mentioned that growth has to come from the traditional side. But how are we doing things differently to ramp up that, one? Secondly, taken the pricing pressure in that space if you see the commoditized space, even if we ramp up, will it be meaningful enough to get us that growth?", "And second part of my question is when we talk about our executional target of $20 billion by 20-20 and if we assume even 12% growth in FY \u201916, we required CAGR probably to do this at 16%, 17%. So do you think this industry is at a place where you can expect 16%, 17% kind of growth, not only for Infosys but does the industry give that kind of potential?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So let me -- Sandeep, let me take that in two different parts. I think the way that you see this materialize, I think the key question that you have is how do you see this actually take shift? There are three parts to that. The first one is simple bread and butter operational efficiency. Getting better at deal mining, getting better at deal, better pitches, redefining, redesigning the RFP and all those process. Many things of this nature that we are putting in place that simply helps us get better at competing and pricing and things like that, that is sort of the basic of the business.", "The second part of it is -- where we are already bringing automation to our existing services. So, I mentioned the example of the package systems work where we are bringing in Panaya. We are also bringing the Panaya technology to other areas like verification, like application maintenance and things -- and infrastructure management.", "We are bringing this thing that we call the Infosys Automation platform that we are currently working on around 35 plus customer shift. I mentioned the example from Syngenta, which again helps to make infrastructure management more competitive by lowering the number of people, by increasing their productivity and by adding a software component to this kind of an IMS deal. So that gives us a differentiate -- ability to differentiate in our existing IMS service packages.", "So that has already started and that will continue to make our existing services more competitive. So that increases the win rate in our existing mills but makes the offering, the services more differentiated and that will lead to a revenue growth. And that is a primary basis of the revenue growth that we see that, and of course, the operational is getting better at working and how we have streamlined our operations and things like that.", "The third I mentioned is a new stuff. The IIP projects, we did a project with -- this last quarter we went live with work we have done with RICO, we have done lots of projects with companies like Hershey and so forth with IPP, also Syngenta we did high level with IIP.", "So we have a several dozen engagements with IIP already going and again, this is not a material part of our revenue, but it is adding up and these are high margin projects, similarly the design thinking kinds of projects. So these will probably over the course of this year this will not make a material difference to the quarter, so to the year, but will start to show up towards the end of the year.", "So the some total of all of that and I think that also builds up the momentum that we need to get going. The biggest part of renewal that we are doing is we have launched this, what I can refer to as a kind of a cultural shift where we are engaging with all project managers in the company, day before yesterday I had a call with 18,000 project managers and they are very straightforward template to bring innovation to every single project that is going on in the company. We believe that this will improve our ability to innovate.", "For example, if you look at BPO. Today we have BPO services where we run operations like procurement or finance and administrative processes and so forth. Where next few year we are getting ready to launch the forecasting service where we can offer on top of IIP the ability of our BPO customers to forecast on the processes than they have.", "So my sense is that with all of these renewal of our existing services, we will be able to aid -- differentiate the offering much better and we bring in this additional revenue streams at on what we have already been doing, which get us to that revenue growth.", "This is our assumption. And of course, time will tell, but where we are sitting, the way we model this out, we feel confident in the -- at least 10% constant currency growth over the years.", "Sandeep Agarwal", "Yes. Sir, thanks for that. Just one small question related to that. If you\u2019ll see the way things are moving in the industry, we are moving towards more and more artificial intelligence. And in my view, as well, artificial intelligence will become key component of the IT services part as well at some point of time.", "So biggest challenge I see is that we have three pyramid -- three parts of the pyramid where employees are and probably in the middle of the pyramid there has been not been much of change in last few years. So don\u2019t you think that there either should be a very big churn in that middle of the pyramid to get this thing going or achieve our target or you will have to probably give a huge training exercise to this part of the pyramid? So in both because of probably the cost will go up temporarily? So what is your sense on that?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think that to a last degree, I mean, if you look at the utilization and the existing fixed cost that we have already incurred in the training infrastructure. I mean, within the P&L that Rajiv just described, we trained 25,000 people on design thinking. And this is not a like a move, this is a one day immersive design thinking program, that was created by George and John Kindel and start totally go out from these school at Sanford.", "So we have already done that. And similarly things of this nature that we are doing, we can create large scale training kinds of offering without incurring significant additional cost. But we will incur and put the additional investment as necessary as innovation is something that I believe is essential to company -- certainly dollar company.", "So we will not, for a second, try away from investing in the kinds of innovation that are necessary in order to get these areas moving. So training is in particular something that is actually really important.", "Sandeep Agarwal", "Thanks. That\u2019s all from my side.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Conning of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Dave Conning", "Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess my question just as we look kind of sequentially through the year? Is Q1 -- because Q4 was a little soft, did something spot into Q1, so Q1 should be a little better than normal or should have falling to kind of that normal 1% to 3% sequential range that it is pretty typically falls into?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Hi. Rajiv here. We don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. I would not want to give a color on how we see Q1 right now. But we have look at our pipeline. We have looked at this in our pipeline, our existing business, the book business and all the investors are making the changes and opportunity.", "And we believe that 10% to 12% on constant currency, because yes, that\u2019s what mean that the first quarter has to deploy decent question. But we are doing -- we want every quarter to be good and every quarter to be better than the previous one. Having said, I would say just that our annual guidance we believe it should be in that range.", "Dave Conning", "Okay, okay. And there wasn\u2019t really anything that got pushed out from Q4 into Q1 that creates anything unnatural or unnormal, right, though?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No. Not in that. I mean, that is always a deal that we have and so forth, but nothing material like that.", "Dave Conning", "Yeah. Okay. And then, the other thing is, your other income line, just that and most of the interest you run on your cash has ramped significantly over the last four or five years and now its like 20% of your pretax income?", "I don\u2019t think we should model as quite as high in fiscal \u201916 given some of the gains I think that you got in some of the FX move since starting fiscal \u201915? But, I guess, is that the right way to think of it? Just -- maybe give us kind of a normalized 2015 number which we can kind of model fiscal \u201916 off?", "Rajiv Bansal", "See normally income has two components, one is the interest income on our cash balance. So last year we have been -- we have done a great job in terms of ensuring that our yield on the investment that we have made up is pretty high. But as you would know, most of our money is in banks in India and interest rates in India has started softening and the yields will likely to come down next year and that will be pressure on operating income.", "Secondly, the exchange gains and losses depending on your hedge position that you take every quarter, we have been lucky in the last year and we have done a good job -- treasury team had done a good job in terms of ensuring that we are positive on the exchange differences. That is something which is very difficult to predict, because you take hedge positions across multiple currencies, against USD, INR, and that is always a thing bet that you take on the currency.", "So we really cannot model the exchange gain that we\u2019re likely to get next year over the one of the losses depending on the volatility on the currencies. But on the interest income, the interest rates are softening in India and yields are likely to come down. Second is we\u2019re trying to make an investments through acquisitions and the investments through innovation fund, which is going to bring out the cash balance.", "We have also increased a dividend payout ratio. So based on that, you would start seeing an operating income in the first year as the total profit started declining over the year, but the right way of matching the business definitely would be the operating margins.", "Dave Conning", "Yes. Okay. And can we assume that if you make an acquisition because the rates have been so high on your cash that it\u2019s a lot harder to make an acquisition accretive, like you could actually do dilutive deals from an EPS standpoint, whereas it seems like a lot of U.S. companies can buy stuff at just giving up 1% cash returns or something that quickly make things accretive that you could make dilutive acquisitions. Is that fair?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, we believe our M&A strategy is not driven by trying to increase our earnings for the quarter or the year. It is in line with what our strategies. We want to make strategic investment. We wanted to grow fast with the company, have a multiply impact on our traditional business. We definitely look at how much time will it take for us to get the payback period or what is the -- how much time it will take to get the EPS accretive.", "So yes, in the year when you make an acquisition is what tend to be an EPS dilutive. But I think, we are very, very sensitive to that part and we make sure that wherever we invest money, it is properly for longer term and with a -- in terms of the longer-term strategy.", "Dave Conning", "Yes. That makes sense. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rishi Jhunjhunwala of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Vishal, just a question on the overall discretionary spending, right. It seems like you\u2019ve been doing some full day workshop with some of top clients that you have. Just wanted to get some sense in terms of what are they saying around where the discretionary spending is going to go incrementally? What we hear is it seems like most of it is going towards digital.", "And if that\u2019s the case then assuming that the Indian IT sources companies in generally are not 100% equipped to cater to that kind of demand. Are we looking at another one or two years of subpar growth in general just because the discretionary spending bit is going to be coming in a lower share to the Indian companies vis-\u00e0-vis some of the other peers?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "That\u2019s a very good question. My sense is that the discretionary spending is going towards what you could say next generation growth area for business, a new growth area. These are typically based on software, on computing technologies around digital, new ways of acquiring customers, new kinds of experiences for consumers and things of this nature, new ways to connect to them and exploring the markets and so forth.", "So, I mean, we did the Skava acquisition precisely for this reason. And so we do see a lot of growth in this area. And it is not that there is anything particular to India where we have any reason to believe that we cannot cater to that. I think the structural issue around the revenue decline and the pricing pressure and so forth is more around the back-office operating areas where things have become a lot more competitive and you have to assume than the pricing pressure there will continue.", "And again, when we look at the long-term future of the company, we see this breakdown between -- as I mentioned, a relatively small amount of inorganic growth, but about 10% growth from these completely new kinds of area. And when you look at the remaining one, we are basically talking about 13%, 14% cumulative growth rate, this is out of our aspiration.", "I mean, obviously, we can do 10% to 12% this year that leaves a five more year to get to those kinds of growth rates and then time will tell that, but we want to sort of spear the company, make that sort of a NOC star for us and spear the company in that direction where we look to get to $20 billion and 30% margin on $80,000 per employee. Because we want to get into this next generation kind of solution model that people are surrounded by much better software around them. And then we use back to create much more efficient solutions in the operational areas but with much more high value services in this next generation area.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Thanks. And just one quick question on capital allocation, right, you\u2019ve increased the payout ratio to 50%. You\u2019ve talked about investing in acquisitions and building technology and infrastructure. And all of that can pretty much be funded through the massive amount of the cash that you generate on an annual basis. Just wanted to get some sense around, do you have anything in mind in terms of the cash that you\u2019re currently sitting on which is also quite a hefty amount? Thank you.", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. It is a perfect thing. You may call it a hefty amount. What we did this time was we put off financial model for five years based on the target that Vishal had articulated session court if the law say. We\u2019re looking at the investment need of the organization. We have looked at the needs to make M&A. The area that we need to make M&A and some of those areas are -- where the multiples are pretty high, look at the needs to make investment in terms of employee, infrastructure, technology assets.", "And all the investment typically have to be made two or three years ahead of time, in terms of infrastructure and land and everything else. When we made our financial models, we looked at our cash flows. We felt that we need to keep that cash and that is something we would need to hold and the cash that we generate every year, 50% would go towards paying dividend, the balance 50% we would spend towards the M&A which is strategic M&As and towards investment in the multiple areas of the business.", "Having said that, it doesn\u2019t mean that, in case, we come across an opportunity which is much large in terms of M&A or investment, we would not do that. That\u2019s what this $5 billion will help us. It\u2019s also for derisking. It\u2019s also for ensuring that we\u2019re able to take a quick decisions, strategic decisions based on the need of the hours and we don\u2019t have to run around for cash.", "So I think the way we to look at is also that over the last 12 months, we have increased our dividend payout ratio 30% to 50%. The 57% increase in dividend payout. Our opportunity has increased in the year. Our EPS growth is about 15%. So it\u2019s kind of year-on-year basis. The dividend payout has increased significantly for the shareholders.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Great. Thank you and best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Hi. Good evening. If I did my math correctly, taken the mid point out of the \u201816 guidance and then working up till the 2020 numbers, you\u2019re somewhere between 18% and 20% CAGR revenue growth with or without the acquisitions, not that far apart. Now automation is driving down deal sizes, the new efforts tend to be smaller deal sizes, and you\u2019ve got a law of large numbers problem. So I guess, help me, how do you get to 18% to 20% revenue growth in years two to five in the plan? Thanks.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think, Edward.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Ed, we -- I don\u2019t know, we can probably connect and look at the math because our numbers shows about 17% of CAGR over the next five years including the M&A part. So if you exclude that it comes to about 15%.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "And then off of that 15%, if you\u2019ve done further breakdown, separate the new from the renewal of the traditional ones. And the renewal comes to between 13 and14, which we believe is much more doable. And the new one has to ramp up to about a $2 billion business. And we see the path to getting there. Now there is a very big difference between having short term aspiration and making an operational plan but that\u2019s too early to obviously do that.", "Right now, our visibility is for this year and our general guidance that we want to get to industry leading growth by financial 2017 which is why we\u2019re searching for time and Mr. Murthy came back. So we are holding on to that, but we have set this as an inspirational goal and it is something that we believe with the mix of capability that we can build and services we can offer we believe that...", "Rajiv Bansal", "Ed, I just got a clarification from my team, I think that $20 billion by 2020 what Vishal was referring to was a calendar year 2020 and not the financial year. So when you change that, that change the metric.", "Edward Caso", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And if you could also talk a little bit about the operating cash flow was the first negative quarter that we\u2019re seeing and as long as we\u2019ve got a model that we\u2019ve been go back a long time. I have to say, there appear to be something about the tax payment but it seems like it was sort of negative across the board, was there something unusual this quarter and does that have implications for cash generation going forward? Thanks.", "Rajiv Bansal", "No. If you exclude those, looking that our affiliations are cancellation has been strong but we spend -- we did acquisition -- we completed the acquisition of Panaya during the quarter. And they just have a little bit more about that was about $221 million, CapEx of $106 million, which is kind of CapEx and the working capital moment is going to normal. What is of the exception item in this quarter was payment of tax, which is we paid of $561 million out of which, though, towards the tax demand that we received form Indian tax was a result of about $280 million.", "It is for the fiscal year \u201810 and \u201811 and probably a large part of industry body and all the company have been appealing against the audit of income tax operated in India and have filed an appeal. But we need to make the payment to a wide interest accumulation on this demand. So most of us make the payment, and then we go into appeal. And that was the payment that we made during the quarter.", "Edward Caso", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. And you may now disconnect your lines."]}

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo. Thank you and over to you sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Inba. Hello everyone and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q1 FY2016 financial results. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; CEO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal along with other members of the senior management team. We will start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company for the recently concluded quarter, followed by comments by Dr. Vishal Sikka and Mr. Rajiv Bansal. Subsequently, we will open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything which we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Vishal Sikka", "Thank you, Sandeep and good afternoon, good evening and good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. I\u2019m very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter that ended on the 30 June, 2015, following the below average performance that we saw in our Q4 of last year. On nearly every parameter, our results were on par or ahead of our plan.", "Quarter-on-quarter our revenue was US$2.256 billion, this compares to our quarter-on-quarter growth of 4.5% in U.S. dollar terms and 4.4% in constant currency. The overall demand environment continues to be encouraging baring a few select industry segments. Our volumes grew by 5.4%. This was the best quarterly growth in revenue in the last 15 quarters and in volume growth in the last 19 quarters, excluding the effect of acquisitions.", "I believe these results are based on creating a deeply client centric organization in our traditional service clients as well as in our new initiatives and in our business enabling functions. In large deals and in top accounts, we have re-imagined the client experience and created new processes to bring more discipline and more focus and this is enabling us to design our proposals based on those specific value drivers for our clients.", "In new service lines, we are seeing widespread adoption of innovation and emerging technologies, both in the grass routes of our organization as well in breakthrough innovation. And this is opening up entirely new type of conversations and new engagements with our clients. Our operating margin for the quarter was 24%, down from the 25.7% of the previous quarter, primarily on account of seasonal wage increments and visa fees.", "Employee utilization was at 80.2% excluding trainee and there is certainly some room for improvement that we see here. We have rolled out with many specific initiatives during the quarter that are targeted at improving the productivity of employees and we are seeing some very encouraging early adoption of these initiatives. We have created a strong operational focus throughout the organization and with every employee. While we are still early in our journey to become the leading next-generation services company, this result gives us good momentum for the rest of the year.", "Let me now talk specifically about few aspects of our performance. Growth came across the board in all of our business segments. In financial services, we had a record quarter under the leadership of Mohit. Under Manish\u2019s leadership, our healthcare and life sciences segment saw one of its strongest quarters. In manufacturing and hi-tech under Sanjay Jalona, key client relationships saw significant expansion. And in energy and communications, under Rajesh, we also saw significant growth despite this accrual pressures.", "And Sandeep\u2019s Retail CPG unit had a great quarter of deal convergence and in delivery with Ravi, who took over our global delivery services, we have seen tremendous growth in horizontal service lines, infrastructure management for example grew by more than 7% quarter-over-quarter. Last quarter, I talked about the changes we have made to rethink our client facing sales and delivery functions and bringing together multiple parts of our \u2013 of the organization and really enhance our other RSP processes. This has begun to show results in large deal wins and in client metrics.", "In large deals, improving our competitiveness to win large multi-year outsourcing engagement is quite important to build a solid revenue base for our future growth and to establish stronger client relationships which are so critical to our business. We closed six deals of more than 40 \u2013 more than $50 million each, including three deals of more than $100 million of total contract value. These include a multi-year agreement with Deutsche Bank, covering be-spoke development, maintenance, digital and mobility package implementation and testing services, and application development and management, transformation, and innovation services deal with Allied Irish Banks. And BPO and SAP services agreement with a shared services unit of the Australian State of New South Wales. And in the first two weeks of July as well, we have won a few more additional large deals.", "From an account mining perspective, we instituted a strong oversight of our top accounts and a more rigorous focus on pipeline development on conversion and on just better connecting the dots and bringing the entire power of our organization to bear on the top clients. Our top 10 clients grew by 5.7% quarter-on-quarter compared to a decline of 1.2% in the previous quarter. We added 37 net new clients and the number of 50 million plus accounts increase to 49.", "We have now integrated our consulting partners into our top 200 accounts. Our intent here is to increase the focus on discovering and delivering new value to our most strategic client partnerships using design thinking methods and we are hopeful that under the leadership of Sanjay Purohit, these consulting led initiatives will show a positive trend throughout the rest of the year.", "Higher revenue per FTE is perhaps the most important measure of the success of our strategy. As I have said before, the pricing environment for traditional services continues to see downward pressure. We will work to change the trajectory of per capital revenue upwards in the coming quarters. Traction in our Finacle and Edge units and the acceleration of the deployment of automation solutions for software maintenance and infrastructure management and in business process outsourcing services will continue to be a key part of our focus towards this objective.", "In Finacle, under Michael\u2019s leadership, we won 15 deals during the quarter, including those with Corporation Bank, Indian Oceans Bank and Qantas Credit Union. Our Edge suite of software-as-a-service offerings were sold into 14 new clients in the last quarter and four of these have already gone live. Johnson & Johnson selected ProcureEdge for its worldwide sourcing operations. BT, Openreach expanded its use of our AssistEdge platform and its call centers for improving their customer service and providing analytical insights. And by the 1st of August, we will have completed the merger of our Finacle and Edge teams into one entity to leverage synergies and product management in go-to-market models and in operational efficiency.", "Our Infosys Automation Platform for infrastructure management is already live in 10 client programs and is already yielding results in the form of up to 37% increase in effect productivity and 17% improvement in human portion of the services. Similarly with Panaya, we have seen some great traction in this last quarter. We won 15 engagements sold by the Infosys sales team together with the Panaya team, in our Retail, Manufacturing, Utilities and Services segments coming together.", "We are now pursuing more than 137 opportunities with Panaya\u2019s cloud suite and Panaya platform, applying it to the enterprise systems upgrade opportunity, as well as going beyond enterprises and upgrades into new areas, like testing, and realizing 35% to 50% productivity gains in these projects, the way they would have done before Panaya. In terms of our mid-term strategies from my one-on-one interactions with client executives and at our client conference in San Francisco, last April, my sense is that our strategies and our actions are resonating well with their own priorities and this has begun to show up in multiple engagements across the company.", "We continue to make headway with our new services. We now have more than 127 client engagements of the Infosys Information platform under Abdul\u2019s leadership with 7 in production and 16 product engagements already finished in areas like predictive analytics for railroads, sales agent effectiveness, customer segmentation and driver telematics. As you know, we also completed the acquisition of Kallidus during the quarter. And there is a growing pipeline, especially in our retail portfolio, for the Skava Mobile Commerce platform. Our M&A and innovation related investments under Ritika\u2019s leadership continue in full steam. We have participated in a Series A investment round in ANSR Consulting, a management consulting that helps Fortune 500 companies in setting up global IT centers, with Infosys as a preferred partner.", "Perhaps one of the most exciting activities of the quarter was our zero-distance initiative to bring new value to all our existing client projects through innovation. This program now touches 70% of our delivery engineers and more than 676 of these ideas have already been discussed with clients. We are tracking these very closely. This grass roots innovation, this innovation in every corner of the company, is at the core of our strategic transformation that we have embarked upon as a company. Ideas for these innovations have come in all kinds of areas, like knowledge based IT and neural networks, early validation and performance testing, test automation using robotics, automation for cloud migration, statistical modeling for marketing campaigns, and next generation technology architectures using new open source technologies.", "From an employee standpoint, we continue to invest in our people. We rolled out an average wage increase of 7.5% to 8% offshore and 2.5% onsite during the quarter. Attrition remains in check. On an annualized basis, attrition during Q1 was 14.2%, compared to 23.4% in Q1 of 2015. That is a more than 9% improvement. There was a slight uptick in absolute terms during the quarter, although this is seasonal for this time of the year. Our total employee headcount for the group stands at 179,000-plus people.", "Employee engagement efforts during the quarter were focused on project management and at the project manager layer, extending innovation at every project in the company. We continue to simplify internal processes and policies to make Infosys a great place to work for every one of our employees. Employee training has always been a top priority for us. We have reinforced our curriculum and strengthened our assessment.", "The Infosys Learning platform, an online, real-time platform for educating our employees, which I talked about last quarter, has now been rolled out to 3,000 trainees. 480 employees have already been trained on machine learning concepts during the quarter, and I\u2019m happy to report that our breakthrough immersion training in design thinking has now crossed more than 40,000 employees. Mr. Murthy always talked about the value of learnability as a key core value of our company, and as you can see, we continue to hold a steadfast focus on this all-important value.", "Finally, one more point on innovation. We are seeing new ideas coming from all corners of the company, reflecting a culture of learning and embracing change. One remarkable example is in our facilities team. We did learn some incredible work on renewable energy, with a goal of making our campuses self sufficient by 2018. Our Hyderabad campus, a beautiful campus, will go completely off grid by the end of this year. Our first quarter performance gives me increased confidence that we can meet our earlier guidance that we provided for the full year, of 10% to 12% growth in financial 2015 constant-currency terms.", "I wish to thank all the leadership team across Infosys from sales and consulting to project delivery and all our enabling functions. All these leaders are committed to and passionate about delivering value to all our clients and to our investors. And now my friend, Rajiv, who was recognized as the best CFO by Finance Asia this quarter, and in my view is the best CFO on the planet, will now take you through the financial highlights before we open up for questions. Rajiv?", "Rajiv Bansal", "Thank you, Vishal. Thanks for all the kind words. Hi, everyone. We ended the quarter with revenues of $2.256 billion, a quarter-on-quarter growth of 4.5% on a reported basis. On constant-currency basis, based on Q4 average rate, we grew by 4.4%, and by 3.6% based on March 31 rates.", "If you recollect in April, we had given a guidance of 10% to 12%, which required a sequential growth rate of 2.8% to 3.5% at March 31st rates to meet our lower and upper end respectively. Our performance in Q1 is in line with the required rate for the upper end. I believe we have done extremely well on the margin front in this quarter. We have been able to contain the impact of wage hike and visa costs on our operating margins to 170 basis points through better operational efficiencies and cost optimization efforts. As you would recall, we rolled out wage hike for our employees effective April. We had also rolled out promotions in line with our quarterly promotion policy.", "During the quarter, our utilization excluding trainees went up from 78.6% to 80.2%, onsite mix, however, increased to 29.2%. Pricing continues to remain under pressure and has declined by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter on a reported basis and 0.8% on a constant currency basis. On a year-on-year basis, pricing has declined by 7.3% in reported terms and [indiscernible] on a constant currency terms.", "We added 11,089 employees gross during the quarter, with a net addition of 3,000, up 2,336 employees. We normally see a higher attrition in Q1 as employees leave during the quarter for pursuing higher studies, our annualized attrition on a standalone basis for the quarter was 14.2% as against 13.4% last quarter. And on a consolidated basis, it was 19.2% as against 18.3% last quarter. However, annualized attrition on a standalone basis was declined by over 900 basis points to 14.2% when compared to Q1 of last year. Similarly, on a consolidated basis, annualized attrition of 19.2% is 700 basis points lower compared to Q1 of last year. This highlights the positive impact of all the initiatives that we have undertaken in the last year to retain our talent.", "Our cash and cash equivalents as of 30th of June was $4.75 billion compared to $5.214 billion as on March 31. The decline in cash and cash equivalents is due to payout of the final dividend and payout towards the acquisition of Kallidus, an impact of increase in DSO days. Our DSO for the quarter went up to 68 days, something that we are all watching very closely. Last quarter, we articulated our capital allocation philosophy with up to 50% of our net profits distributed as dividends and the balance to be invested mainly for our M&A and CapEx needs.", "With interest rates falling and expected to fall further during the year, we expect our interest income as a percentage of revenue to significantly be lower in current year as compared to last year. During the quarter, we have seen volatile currency markets depreciating against U.S. dollar and all major global currencies. For instance, on the quarter end exchange rate, rupee depreciated by 1.8% against U.S. dollar, 8.2% against British pound, 6.5% against Swiss franc, and 6.0% against Euro. This has resulted in a ForEx loss of four million for the quarter.", "We had outstanding hedges of $996 million at the end of the quarter. Though the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, we expect it to be between 29% to 30% for FY2016 due to increase in statutory tax rate in India and some of our SEZ units moving from 100% tax exemption to 50% tax exemption.", "We have retained the constant currency guidance at 10% to 12% for FY2016, which was given in April due to favorable cross-currency movements between March 31st and June 30th. 10% to 12% in constant currency now translates to 7.2% to 9.2% in U.S. dollar reported terms compared to 6.2% to 8.2% that we gave in April. This is a sequential growth rate of 2.3% to 3.5% CQGR from Q2 to Q4 at June 30th rates. We continue to expect our operating margins to be in the band of 25%, plus/minus 1%.", "With that, I\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Good morning/good evening. Congratulations on your quarter. I\u2019ve sort of focused on some of the traditional businesses, infrastructure management, ADMO and so forth, which you\u2019re enjoying strong volume, but they\u2019re also the more commoditizing part of the market. Is that where you\u2019re seeing price pressure? And is that what\u2019s weighing on margins here? And then maybe, if you could lead that into a discussion of where you are in automation, both automation of new work you\u2019re winning and automation of existing work? Thank you.", "Vishal Sikka", "Thanks, Edward. That\u2019s a great question. Let me start and then Rajiv can add as necessary and Pravin can add as necessary. We do see indeed downward pricing pressure in areas, commoditizing areas like infrastructure, some parts of maintenance and verification and so forth. And that is why also we believe that automation needs to come in there probably before other areas also because they are also more amenable to automation. If you look at application development as a category, it used to be the primary category for Infosys 15-plus years ago, and that continues to be something that is much more human oriented and many of these infrastructure type services continue to be ones where \u2013 which are more amenable to automation.", "We have been \u2013 since I started my journey here at Infosys almost one year ago, we have been investing heavily in bringing automation to bear across the board. And in this last quarter, we saw the first tangible results of that. We rolled out our Infosys Automation Platform, which is a collection of tools, AI based technologies to help automate many of these routine, mechanizable tasks. We rolled that out an infrastructure management to 10 clients.", "We had a very interesting result that came up as a result of that. These 10 clients \u2013 the category of work that was done by people was about 1,080 people and we replaced the work of 1,187 out of the 1,080 people with automation. That is a saving of about 17% in terms of the number of people, and the productivity improvement of we saw up to 37% in the work as a result.", "So what that does is you see that in infrastructure management going forward, we will replace the work that was offered as a people-only service into people plus this software. The software comes that we charge for it at a high margin, it reduces the number of people working on a given project and therefore, we breakout of this vicious cycle of utilization, RPP and profit margins by creating this people-only model and transforming that into a people-plus-software model where the software is much higher margin, the number of people is less and we are able to provide the customer a more differentiated offering at a cheaper price, thereby being economically attractive to the customer and meet that cycle.", "We want to replicate this cycle across the board in every service. In Panaya, as I mentioned earlier, we had 15 sales that were done by the Infosys sales team, aid in manufacturing alone. This is a great example. The financials of that are not significant yet because 15 deals are relatively small, but the fact that our sales team has embraced this motion of selling these new solutions and this new model is a very encouraging sign for the future that we are able to replace a project that would have been a people-only project in the past with a smaller number of people and with the additional Panaya software.", "So again, you see this pattern of replacing a people-only service with smaller number of people, perhaps that you can charge more for with the software, so then the collective economics for the customer becomes better, the margin profile for us becomes better and we are able to free up the people to do more things of the same nature or more things of a different nature. Going forward, we will see more and more of this. This quarter, in our infrastructure practice, we are already bringing the same practice to four dozen clients already. We have started that in Q2 now.", "And similarly, in the other areas of our service lines, like in verification and in application maintenance, through our zero-distance initiative, I was very encouraged to see that 1,400 master projects covering about 23,000 people are now looking at ways to automate what are the work that they do, so that they can do more with less, [indiscernible] to say.", "This is in essence the key motion, key procedure that we want to repeat over and over again and bring to a much larger scale, as we grow forward. If we are to bring automation as a differentiator to our clients and if we are to get away from this \u2013 sort of this downward spiral of increasingly lowering costs, this lowered RPP, further burden of utilization and so on.", "Edward Caso", "As a quick follow-up, realization continues to be negative. Is that losing important, this is a metric here as the automation kicks in? Or should we start to see a positive turn in that end, the realization metric? Thank you.", "Vishal Sikka", "Yeah. Over a period of time that will \u2013 that will happen, Edward. Not immediately, but I mean as the \u2013 as we see the embrace of automation and the adoption of automation happen on a more widespread basis, you will see that happen.", "Edward Caso", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from James Freedman of Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.", "James Freedman", "Hi. Congratulations on these excellent numbers. So Vishal, on the afternoon call, you had described a new intensity to sales. I think you had used the word, aloof and detached, in your characterization of the sales culture previously. I was just trying to get the sense of how much you have been able to re-engineer the sales initiatives? And what \u2013 clearly you have the tangible evidence here, but what are some of the methodologies that you\u2019re using to try and elevate the sales culture?", "Vishal Sikka", "Well, James, so let me clarify that. I was not referring to \u2013 we have never had an aloof and detached sales structure ever in our history of our company over the last 34 years. And the thing that I was referring to as being aloof and detached is the RFP institution that exists in our \u2013 in the services industry. The very nature of an RFP and going through a proposal process is such that there is somewhat of a distance to it. There is an aloofness to it and that\u2019s what I was referring to. It\u2019s one of the things that our sales team is as passionate as ever and continues to be and it has always been the case. In fact, you know we have had a very distinguished history of a highly \u2013 high value, high integrity sales organization across our history, so I want to clarify that in no uncertain terms.", "Having said that, one of the things that we did in this last quarter was we did bring a tremendous focus to the way that we \u2013 that we sell, the way that we go after the contracts and the opportunities. And one of the most visible signs of that was the work that we did in redesigning our RFP process. This RFP process that I talked about, we have been thinking much more about how do we bring design thinking to the RFP process?", "How do we bring a much deeper sense of client-centricity and empathy for the client, into that RFP process, changing the narrative, deeply understanding the strategic priorities of the clients and the value that we \u2013 that we bring in our offerings and prepare that in a proposal that is much more attractive and that the clients can relate to and we already saw the first successes of that in every one of the large deals that we won in the course of the last quarter and that we have won since then. So we have had at least one sort of deep change that happened as a result of this new RFP process. So I hope this answers your question.", "James Freedman", "Yes. Thank you and then just one follow-up. Rajiv, could you revisit your SEZ conversation? I didn\u2019t quite follow what\u2019s going on there. But what that implies for the tax rate going forward?", "Rajiv Bansal", "No, if you would \u2013 no. In India, we have a tax exemption for all the software services export that we do from special economic zones. So the tax regulation in India says for the first five years, we get 100% tax exemption and from the sixth year onwards, we will get 50% tax exemptions. Some of these SEZ units were set up five years back and they are moving to 50% tax exemption during the year. As a result of that, the effective tax rate is actually to go up because of this profits moving from 100% tax exemption to 50% tax exemptions. In addition, there has been an increase in the statutory tax rates in India, and that is another reason why the effective tax rate is actually to go up this year.", "James Freedman", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I guess my first question here was could you give us some idea of what portion of your business is in some of the newer offerings like digital versus some of what you\u2019re seeing on the commoditization side?", "Vishal Sikka", "That is a good question, Joseph. There is a tremendous sense of ambiguity in the industry around what digital exactly means. When you look at it philosophically, when Nicholas Negroponte wrote the great book, Being Digital, when look at it in that sense, everything that we do is digital. So I would say that 100% of our revenue is in digital. But when we look at in the sense of digital and what it is doing to the industries that we serve, for example, to retail, and how digital is enabling a completely new set of experiences for consumers in the retail environment, or how digital is about bringing mobile devices and transforming the experience of the consumer, or how digital changes the manufacturing industries towards becoming much more, where software becomes embedded.", "I mean, if you look at the dashboard of an S-class Mercedes today, the entire dashboard is a digital one, there are no knobs and switches and needles that used to be there. So in that sense, there are tremendous opportunities that we see in how the physical world of our clients is becoming transformed by the \u2013 by digital technology and we see a great sort of opportunities there. My \u2013 I mean so we do a lot of business in these new areas. Almost all the work that we are doing in the digital technology space is in these kinds of opportunities. Almost all our design thinking work that we do, almost all the analytics work that we do, is in these kinds of engagements in these kinds of areas.", "So once the industry settles down on a better, more precise and a more realistic definition of what they mean by digital, I mean there are massively varied distributions in how companies characterize their digital revenue, and I think it is \u2013 frankly, in my view, it is nonsense. And so once they have that then we\u2019ll be able to more precisely articulate the parts of our business that are those areas. But let me just, for now, say that as the world around us becomes increasingly digital and increasingly driven by this transformation of the physical experiences into virtual ones, we are seeing almost all our growth coming in \u2013 in almost all of those areas we see tremendous growth in our business.", "Joseph Foresi", "Well, I mean I agree that there needs to be some \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, go ahead. Did I cut somebody off there?", "Vishal Sikka", "No, no, go ahead, Joseph.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. Yeah, I agree there needs to be a standard definition on the digital side. But I guess my question is, as you see these projects develop in digital, are they new incremental business? Does it impact your visibility at all? And how should we think about them from a margin perspective? I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of sort of how you compete versus some of the other players who are obviously claiming fairly good growth rates and larger \u2013 large percentages of their revenue from digital?", "Vishal Sikka", "The way I would characterize that is the new engagements from our consulting team, the way we are reorganizing and setting up our consulting is in two distinct categories, towards the renewal of the existing businesses, we have created the theme of, what we call, knowledge-based IT, which is a overarching program to help transcend and renew the existing landscapes, the IT landscapes of customers.", "And the new area, which is all about, I think, all about what you have been referring to as digital, which is around, how do we transform, help transform our clients\u2019 businesses in strategic new areas. So in retail, that means really finding the experience of the consumer, creating more omni-channel, as well as rethinking the physical spaces that can consumers are going to.", "I mean if you notice in the retail world, many chains have been closing down their stores and things like that, but many others are actually rethinking the physical store as a great new kind of a digital experience and we are helping many of our retail clients with these kinds of changes. Or even in banks or telecos and people who have retail presence and in hospitals, physical spaces are becoming increasingly digital and we are seeing a great growth happening in these areas.", "Or if you look at some of the other industries around CPG where you optimize the supply chain using the completely digital technologies where in the past there was a lot of physical presence and so forth or in energy with digital oil fields. Everywhere we see that the new of the equation of renew and new almost inevitably ends up being all about digital.", "So the way I would put it is the product and platforms business, all the IP-led services business, the design thinking business, almost all of the new and parts of the renew will all be about this so-called digital transformation of businesses. And the rest will be about the renewal of the existing landscapes to move it to the cloud and things like that.", "So the key ends up being is which part of the customers\u2019 business which used to the physical or analog is now becoming digital or virtual and how do we put a bracket around that? And I think that is a good way to measure what this means and in our case that would be again the good way to measure that.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. And then last question for me sort of a quick one. On the profitability side, I understand the margin profile for this year and sort of what you\u2019ve given for the guidance for the bracket there. But as digital becomes a larger piece of your business and you balance it versus commoditization, where do you see or how do you feel about the profitability of the business and present margin levels over a longer period of time? And you don\u2019t have to give us a number, but I\u2019m just sort of trying to get an idea of sort of what you think is sort of a realistic level?", "Vishal Sikka", "I think that so far the visibility that we have operationally over the rest of this year we feel comfortable with the 25 plus or minus one guidance that we have given. If you look at beyond that, the \u2013 earlier \u2013 in response to one of the earlier questions I mentioned that the formula that we are following is of taking a people-oriented proposal, which was 100% driven by people, and transforming that into a lesser number of people plus software. And we charge for the software as we do for Panaya, or IAP, or IIP or the other platforms.", "So that equation changes in a way that instead of 100% people at a certain rate and so forth, towards lesser number of people plus software it does three things. It \u2013 first of all, it lowers the cost to the client and it helps our service become more differentiated and more attractive because we can lower the price of the software, you have a lesser number of people, so you have more room to maneuver. Second, it actually helps us to improve our margin because the software is at a much larger margin and we have lowered the number of people who are in the part of the proposal. And third, it frees up the people to do more, to do more of the new kinds of things like the digital things that you were talking about and to do more projects of the same nature.", "So this cycle we want to repeat over and over again, and my expectation is that if we are successful at scaling up this cycle, as we have done the early work of that in this last quarter with Panaya and with IAP and so forth, then we will see the margin profile actually not come under pressure, and in fact increase. And that is why I have laid out our aspiration of getting the 30% margin by 2020. If we are successful at replicating and scaling up this virtuous cycle of going from a people only model to people per software model, then we will be able to increase our margin profile without compromise and that is our assumption.", "Joseph Foresi", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ravi Menon of Elara Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon", "Hi gentlemen, congratulations on a great quarter. First question is on the high number of laterals that we\u2019ve seen as a proportion of gross hiring over the last three quarters. I mean do you think that this is investment in your new areas, maybe in the Infosys Information Platform, or trying to extend Panaya into \u2013 are you making it useful for other ERP packages as well, like Oracle, you know, getting Finacle ready for the U.S. launch, things like that, or is this also kind of a retake of the employee pyramid with new capabilities, new skill sets that you require in your traditional areas of business?", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here. Let me respond to that question. So what you\u2019re seeing is a short-term phenomenon, so we are seeing many transformations, the need for investing in newer areas, so why do we try to ramp-up on the capabilities and cross skill people internally. So there is some dependence on external highs. And some of these areas are also on some of the newer technologies, where you may not have too many people. But over a period of time once we are able to cross skill our people, we will see a reduced dependence on \u2013 we\u2019ll see those lateral numbers coming down. We will continue to be reliant on our people, training them, re-skilling them and they\u2019ll be able to scale up and take on some of the new technology roles.", "Ravi Menon", "Thank you, Sam. And I have a follow-up for that. Do you \u2013 can you give us a rough timeframe of when you think Finacle could be launched in the U.S. and similarly Panaya\u2019s extension for Oracle and other platforms?", "Pravin Rao", "We have already achieved, from a functionality point of view, a lot of the capabilities that we need for the U.S. market. We already have successful clients and of course, we have talked about Discover Financial as a great success story that we have had with Finacle recently. And we have done additional deals in the U.S. as well, and we are scaling up our presence there, primarily from an implementation services perspective. So we are very confident that Finacle will be able to address the \u2013 certainly the Tier 3, Tier 4 banks in the U.S. market, which is a huge opportunity for us.", "We believe that Finacle is a great core banking platform. We believe that it is the best core banking platform on the planet and we are continuing to invest heavily in this in Michael\u2019s leadership. And we are very confident about its capabilities in the U.S. market. I mean as you may have seen recently many analysts voted Finacle as the best banking platform in the world. We have recently ported it to the Azure platform, Azure Cloud platform with Microsoft and we are also working with Oracle to move Finacle to the Oracle cloud. And we expect to see growth in the U.S. in the coming quarters.", "Ravi Menon", "Thank you, sir.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman\u2026", "Vishal Sikka", "One more thing before we get to the next question. The Panaya, Sanjay what were you saying, Panaya 30% is already in the Oracle space.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question is from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Yeah. Thank you. Rajiv, for you if I could, if you could talk a little bit about \u2013 you mentioned operating margins are expected to be \u2013 continue to expect to be 25% plus or minus. If you could talk about some of the puts and takes relative to the quarter you just reported and particularly address how does the pricing and commoditization that you\u2019re seeing in the business impact that? But if you could deal with some of the puts and takes as you rollout here over the next couple of quarters to the operating margins?", "Rajiv Bansal", "That\u2019s a good question because we are seeing pricing pressures and we are seeing very, very competitive pricing environment in almost all our large deals that we are bidding for. But you also have to understand that as we embrace automation and we talk about more effort productivity, some of that would contain the impact of pricing pressure that you are seeing in the market.", "Second is the training and re-training and re-skilling of people. Our subcontracting expenses as a percent of revenues have actually steadily gone up from 2.5%, 3% a couple of quarters back to 5%. As you know subcontractors are a multiple of the employee cost per capita. And that is another lever which we are focusing on in terms of training and re-skilling our people so that we are able to replace high cost subcontractors on the projects, which will give us some margin lever. We have spoken about utilization and as you know that we would like our utilization to be 83%, 84% and today we are operating at about 80%. So that\u2019s another 4% lever that we have.", "Keith Bachman", "Right.", "Rajiv Bansal", "Roll ratios are very important. In the last couple of years, when our growth was muted, it did not give us enough opportunities to correct our roll ratios because employees do expect promotions even if there\u2019s non-growth that\u2019s an issue in the industry. The industry, the competition was doing well and to retain the best talent that we had. We rollout promotions, roughly about 25,000 promotions last year. So you know, as we see an acceleration in our growth, we believe that we\u2019ll be able to achieve a much leaner and better roll ratios.", "So enough levers that we have on the margin front in the medium to long-term. In the short term, yes, it creates a problem because when you are in the middle of the quarter when you\u2019re looking at your investment needs to extrude the growth, look at the needs of the projects in terms of staffing and the technology assets that they need. At the same time, you have to work within a very narrow margin band. There is a fine balance that we have to strike on a day-to-day basis, and I think over the last five quarters, we have struck a good balance.", "Honestly, I would not want to improve the margins at the cost of investments, which will lead to better growth. So every single investment is looked at from a return perspective, from an ROI perspective. And if it makes sense in the medium to long term, we\u2019ll go ahead and make the investment, even if that means that in the short term or the near quarter, you would see a dip in the margin. So I think our philosophy on the margin is very clear. We would want, as Vishal had articulated by 2020, we would want our margins to be about 30% of operating margin. It\u2019s a long journey. And in the near term, we have to balance the needs very, very carefully.", "Keith Bachman", "Yes, fair enough, fair enough. Okay, I did want to come back to the 30% margin aspiration in 2020. If you think about the next five years, roughly a point a year, so to speak, but how do you get there, because you\u2019ve talked about adding IP is one of the key variables in machine learning and automation. I would assume as you acquire more RP though \u2013 IP excuse me that you\u2019ll start to bump into some of the software vendors, who are also your partners would then become I would think some level of competition. But maybe if you could just \u2013 how you anticipate getting to the 30% in some of the bigger pockets?", "Vishal Sikka", "I think that from a software vendor perspective, if you look at the platform layers, more and more of the platform technologies that are relevant in the modern world continue to be open source. So maintenance and delivery offerings around open source software, maybe add value to existing open source software and any contribution that we make is also \u2013 goes back into open source, and our IP is on solutions built on top of it. I think is a model whereby we can prevent ourselves from getting into the trap of on the one hand competing with legacy or incumbent vendors and on the other hand continuing to monetize our IP.", "From the perspective of application development and custom solution development, one of the benefits of being at Infosys is that we have the tremendous scale to bring these kinds of custom or highly micro-vertical solutions \u2013 industry-oriented solutions to life in a way that a pure package system vendors cannot. And I think \u2013 when I came here that was one of the most attractive things I found about Infosys, is that, that opportunity exists and being able to at a very massive scale, bring unique IP-based differentiator solutions for narrow parts of industries.", "For example, one of the amazing solutions that we have built using AI technology is a solution to balance an aircraft. And we have been working on this and it is amazing. And we can \u2013 in airplanes, weight \u2013 when engines are mounted on it, it can be balanced. And we have built AI systems to do this in a much more accelerated way than was possible using previous techniques. Now, this has probably 10, 12 customers that use that, but it has an extremely high value to those 10, 12 customers. And we can afford to do point solutions, highly niche industry-specific solutions for these types of things. And usually the new kinds of problems where software is making it way for the first time don\u2019t have package system vendors anyway.", "So we believe that that strategy of being open to whatever exists in our clients\u2019 landscape, being a partner to everybody, being open to everybody and yet being able to carve a niche for ourselves by building differentiated IP-based solutions is the right strategy which manages to get around these existing pitfalls that we see in the world today.", "Keith Bachman", "All right, thank you gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rishi Jhunjhunwala of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Yes thanks for the opportunity, a couple of questions. First on \u2013 in the sharp rebound in the growth in this quarter, just wanted to understand a bit more on how much of that would you attribute to on-ground demand actually picking up versus re-executing much better in this quarter? And just trying to keep to seasonality aside, we understand that typically June is a better quarter?", "Vishal Sikka", "Rishi, my sense of it, and perhaps Pravin and Rajiv and any of our leaders who are sitting here can add their perspective on it. My sense of it is that obviously, better execution and much more focus that we brought, along with the changes that we put into the organization to \u2013 again, to focus ourselves in a very deeply client-centric way is primarily the reason for the result that you have seen.", "And some of it, I would also attribute to the strategic initiatives that we have put in place over the last three, four quarters, which are now starting to bear fruit. But that is not \u2013 but a much larger percentage of the change that I would attribute to is to the better execution and to the initiatives that we put into place. I see lots of people nodding their heads around the room, so, and I don\u2019t think anybody wants to add anything to that.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Great and second question is over the past four to five years, we have seen that consistently we\u2019ve been starting the year well, however, in Q3 and Q4 the growth seems to be tapering off. And I\u2019m not talking about, again, the sequential seasonality, but even in year-on-year growth terms it tapers off in the past few years. You mentioned in the morning that you\u2019d hope and you\u2019d worked towards rectifying that growth trajectory or the trend, just trying to understand first of all what is the issue that even year-on-year growth actually tapers off? And secondly, what steps you can potentially take to make sure that second half is \u2013 the deterioration doesn\u2019t happen as it has happened in the past years?", "Vishal Sikka", "We are acutely aware of this. We have looked into this our management team has been thinking about this over the last few weeks and the last quarter or so. For whatever set of reasons this has been the case in the last several years, and we are aware of this and we are working hard to make sure that this year is not a repeat of that. Again by pipeline building, and client centric focus, looking at getting better visibility into the future of projects and the opportunities of the clients, and so forth.", "But the other reason that I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that the second half of this year will not have the same fate as the second half of the previous years, certainly relative to the previous years, is that the initiatives that we have put in are consistently picking up steam. And while these are still small, I mean on our IIP, as proud as we are that we have 127 projects, on Panaya we have 137 engagements, on design thinking we have more than 100 engagements. But together all these add up to like 400 projects out of a baseline of 8,500 projects.", "And so as important as these are, they are still small; but there is a consistent rise in the adoption of these. And therefore, we believe that as we get into the second half of the year, more of the growth will come from these kinds of initiatives. And the zero-distance will have picked up more momentum by then and so forth, so that will also help in addition to the operational excellence and the deep scrutiny on this particular scourge that we have had in the past that that will be okay. So I feel \u2013 as I sit here today, I feel cautiously optimistic. I feel aware of this problem that we have had in the past years and cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to do better this year.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "And do you think that by nature these revenues are less seasonal than the traditional services that we do?", "Vishal Sikka", "I don\u2019t think so. I mean maybe Rajiv and Pravin can add their insights into that. My \u2013 I come from the point of view that great solutions and great innovation is of a timeless nature. And when times are bad, you need innovation, and when times are good, you need innovation. There are some furloughs and things like that that happen in our Q3 in the manufacturing industry and other kinds of things, but we know them in advance and we know that and we should be able to, with appropriate forecasts and better planning, we should be able to mitigate those. So that sort of how I, at a high level, I look at it. But obviously, an organization of 180,000 people continually goes through the same exercise every year, so there must of some sort of reasons for that and we are working hard to make sure that this year, we don\u2019t have the same fate as the previous year.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Dave Koning", "Yes. Hey, guys. Great job and I just have a couple of short ones. But the acquisition contribution from Panaya and Kallidus or Kallidus or whatever, how big were those in the quarter? Maybe how much sequential growth did that drives to?", "Pravin Rao", "Well the incremental from the two acquisitions that we have done is only about $7 million during the quarter. Skava and Kallidus were closed, these were closed on only the 3 of June, so it\u2019s only a one-month revenue. And Panaya and Kallidus are small acquisitions. They\u2019re very strategic acquisitions, but they don\u2019t really add much to the top line in the initial stage, but they have a huge multi-player effect on the entire business of the company. So in terms of your question, it\u2019s only about $7 million incremental revenue that is factored in the revenue.", "Dave Koning", "Okay, great. And somebody else asked about the tax rate, the 29% to 30% this year. Is that sort of what we should expect going forward now? Has that all normalized?", "Vishal Sikka", "It seems though because the increase in tax rate is primarily because of statutory \u2013 increase in statutory tax rate in India, which I don\u2019t see coming down unless the Government of India in the next budget decides to bring it down. And also the fact that some of the units would move from 100% tax exemption to 50% exemption, I would believe that this is here to stay.", "Dave Koning", "Okay. And then lastly just the subcontractor portion of expense, that ramp, I think it was the highest it\u2019s been, maybe ever, is a little over 5% of the rev. What\u2019s driving that? And maybe is that something we should expect to stay elevated?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, this is Pravin here. There are times when there is need to ramp up quickly on a particular skills. If we don\u2019t have internally, we may need to deploy subcontractors. And sometimes, particularly in quarter one and quarter two, our quarter one and quarter two, we also at times have a very high percentage of visa utilization, so we don\u2019t have too many people with visas. So that means that either way we have to recruit or we have to use subcontractors in the short period of time till we are able to back fill. So what you are seeing is something that because of mix of mismatching skills, as well as pressure on the visa. But over a period of time, we should be able to bring it down.", "Dave Koning", "Got you, cool thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "We would like to thank everyone for joining us on this call and spending time with us. We look forward to talking to you again during the course of the quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q2 FY 2016 financial results.", "I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. Rajiv Bansal; CFO Designate, Mr. MD Ranganath; along with other members of the senior management team. We'll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company by comments by Dr. Sikka, followed by comments by the leadership team. Subsequently, we'll open up the call for questions.", "Before I hand it over to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything which we say, which refers to our outlook for the future, is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'd now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "Thanks, Sandeep, and good morning and good evening, folks. Thanks for joining us. I am very pleased with our performance for the quarter ending September 30, 2015.", "Our revenue for the quarter was, in U.S. dollar terms, $2.392 billion. This translates to a quarter-on-quarter growth of 6% in U.S. dollar reported terms, and 6.9% in Q1 constant currency terms. This numbers includes a one-time early termination fee paid to us by a client that went through an internal restructuring, and therefore had to terminate the project. Excluding this extraordinary item, our revenue growth was still strong at 5.9% in constant currency and 5% in U.S. dollar reported terms.", "We have retained our annual guidance of 10% to 12% in constant currency, so there is no change in our guidance. We are aware that even if we grow flat over the next two quarters, the annual growth could be at the higher end of this guidance of 10% to 12%. The second half traditionally had seasonal dips in growth. While it is our endeavor and we will work hard to buck this trend, given the short-term headwinds in a few accounts, we have been cautious in keeping this guidance unchanged.", "Our volumes grew 3.7% and our blended per capita revenue improved by 2.6%. The demand environment continues to be a very good one, except for seasonal variations. Our operating margin for the quarter was 25.5%, up from 24% in the previous quarter, helped largely by better operational efficiencies, better utilization as well as 70 basis points due to currency movements. We reported earnings per share of $0.23 in U.S. dollar terms.", "Employee utilization was 81.3%, up from 80.2% in Q1, this is excluding trainees. I continue to be somewhat perplexed by the notion of the bench, which I believe pervades IT services companies. We have launched an internal program here at Infosys called Zero Bench and, in just about 90 days, we have created a marketplace to leverage our extra capacity of talent. The platform already has 3,832 jobs posted and approximately 50% of our bench have worked on these jobs. I am convinced that we can get this to 100% within the rest of the fiscal year, and work to eliminate the inefficiencies stemming from under utilization.", "Let me talk about now some of the key developments of the quarter and share some perspective on the execution of our strategy. In Q2, we deepened our client relationships. The number of $50 million-plus clients grew to 50. Our top client grew by 8.4%, and the top 25 clients grew 7.9% in constant currency faster than the company's average growth rate for the second quarter in a row. We added 24 net new clients during the quarter. Our momentum of large deal wins continued and we won five large deals in the quarter and nearly $1 billion in total contract value for the first time ever. The pipeline of our large deals continues to be a good one.", "Notable client engagements and wins from this quarter include ABB, Saks Fifth Avenue, India's Goods and Services Tax Network, TOMS Shoes, CPO Commerce, Baxters Food Group and others.", "We are making progress on the execution of our strategy with our focus on better client relationship management, proposal quality improvement, as well as a strong discipline around large deals, pipeline and internal operational efficiencies. At the same time, we are seeing our clients on a shared path with us to leverage innovation and the next-generation of services in which software, platforms and systems amplify people's ability.", "Let me share some examples. On the renew front of our strategy, Zero Distance continues to be a strategic differentiator for us. This is a program inside Infosys to bring innovation to every single project that we do and we now have more than 5,680 projects from across our service lines taking these innovative ideas to their clients. This is a large scale embrace of innovation at our very grass roots in our delivery organization and these 5,680 projects reflect more than 80% of our delivery organization participating in bringing some innovation to their project or the other. Many of these ideas embrace automation to optimize operational spend and renew client technology landscapes.", "On August 20, we launched Aikido, comprising three enhanced service offerings in our knowledge-based IT work, platform work and in design thinking. The key of Aikido is all about the renewal of existing landscapes, about bringing in new technologies and new tools, AI, DevOps, the API economy, cloud and automation, to name a few. It is about capturing the know-how that is latent inside the minds of the people, inside the systems and the processes that are inside the enterprise IT landscapes, and to bring this into our traditional engagements, whether it is in application maintenance, in testing, in BPO, or in other systems.", "One example of this is a large European turbo machinery company that engaged us in a complex confidential geometry project that required deep knowledge and software technique for turbo machinery as well as in visualization, in constraint satisfaction and other AI technologies to develop critical application for designing, rendering, and generating manufacturing data to reduce cycle and effort by 40% and minimize errors. The Ai of Aikido is about platforms and platforms as a service, including our Infosys Information Platform, Infosys Automation Platform, Panaya, Skava, Finacle and Edge products.", "The Infosys Information Platform now has more than 160 engagements to-date with 38 going in production or already in production over the course of the last quarter. We have added several new capabilities including Natural Language Processing and deployed IIP now on Amazon Web Services, as a self-service trial. Some of the new IIP projects include generating sales insights for a large Australian retailer, enabling real time prediction for out-of-stock items for a chocolate retailer, enabling predictive maintenance of manufacturing equipment for a large pharmaceutical company and many more.", "The Infosys Automation Platform is now in 66 engagements across 57 clients. And we have extended it from just Infrastructure Management to other service lines, for example, ADM and Testing, as well as BPO. It is starting to generate material productivity improvements in our delivery organization, ranging from 17% to 50% in effort savings. In the first half of 2016, from this massive embrace of automation at Infosys, all service lines together released 833 people from production projects. BPO released 354. In Q2 alone, this included 300 people from our Infrastructure Management Service, 348 from ADM and Infrastructure and Infosys Verification Service, and 159 from BPO.", "On Panaya and Skava, the integration into Infosys is going very well. We added 53 new clients on Panaya and won 20 deals jointly with other Infosys business units. More significant is that Panaya is helping us with larger engagements, where we are transforming clients' enterprise package landscapes. Skava posted better than expected growth in Q2, and there are more than 50 opportunities in a joint Infosys-Skava solution. The synergies are clear in cloud, automation, and in new digital experiences for consumers.", "We completed the merger of our Finacle and EdgeVerve businesses in August. We had 39 wins and 23 go-lives for both the Finacle and Edge suite of solutions across various markets. Some of the quarter's notable Finacle deals include the rollout of Finacle Assure at the State Bank of India and Finacle Payments to 6,800 branches of the Punjab National Bank in India.", "And the last part of Aikido is Do, which is about bringing design-led services to our consumers \u2013 to our customers. We have conducted 117 Do engagements with our clients to date, and these have begun to result not so much in revenue, but even more importantly in elevating our relationships with our clients and in bringing us closer to the most important strategic areas they face.", "Let me now talk about our employees. The group's total head count stood at 187,976 people as of September 30. In annualized terms, standalone attrition dropped to 14.1% this quarter. We continue to simplify our internal processes, and we redesigned our performance management framework to focus on individual accountability and continuous feedback. We also continue our strong emphasis on training and learning. We increased the Infosys Learning Platform and launched a platform for interactive video-based learning that our executives are using to teach our employees. And on bringing Design Thinking into everything that we do at Infosys, we have now trained more than 54,000 employees.", "With regard to partnerships, we are seeing unprecedented demand from startups to work with us as a part of our innovation plan. Startups see Infosys not just as an investor, but as a strategic driver that helps us validate and grow their addressable market. Our recent partnership with incubators like Level39 and Innovate Finance are some examples of our strengthening reach. We continue to selectively pursue acquisitions, those which represent the future, not the past, and those that will bring value to our clients.", "Growth through alliances has been a key focus area for Infosys. We are deepening our relationships with key existing partners such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, IBM, EMC, Huawei and Tableau, to name a few. We also entered into new partnerships with GE and with NetSuite. We further extended our research collaboration with top universities like Stanford, Cornell, and Emory University on Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and security.", "For this fiscal year, we pledged INR 270 crore towards corporate social responsibility, primarily for activities being carried out through the Infosys Foundation in areas related to education, healthcare, destitute care and rural development.", "The Infosys Foundation USA launched its inaugural Infy Maker Award, a commitment made to us at the White House earlier this year, with the objective of sparking the spirit of making in everyday learning. In addition, Infosys Foundation USA also continues to fund grants to make high-quality computer science education widely and easily accessible to everyone in the United States.", "I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of Infoscions all around the world, and especially our management team, our business unit leaders, who are in the room here with me today: Sandeep Dadlani, Mohit Joshi, Rajesh Murthy, Manish Tandon, Sanjay Purohit, Ravi Kumar, Abdul Razak, Michael Reh, Anup Uppadhayay, Binod HR, and of course, my friend and a team partner, Praveen.", "We announced today that MD Ranganath, or Ranga, who is currently our Executive Vice President of Strategic Operations, will take over as CFO from Rajiv Bansal effective tomorrow, October 13, 2015. Rajiv has expressed his intention to leave the company for personal reasons, but to continue as an advisor to me through December 31 to effect a smooth transition.", "I have worked closely with Ranga since joining Infosys, and I have come to known him as a passionate and a balanced leader with the utmost integrity and I look forward to working closely with him. Rajiv has been instrumental in executing our financial strategy and we'll miss him, his brilliance and his passion.", "So for one last time, I will request Rajiv to take you through the financial highlights, before we open it up to questions.", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Vishal. Good morning everyone. As Vishal mentioned, we had a good quarter with all round growth across geographies, verticals and service lines. All our operating parameters improved during the quarter. Our volumes grew by 3.7%, utilization excluding trainees improved by 1.1% and the pricing improved by 2.6% on reported basis.", "We ended the quarter with revenues of $2.392 billion, a quarter-on-quarter increase of 6% on reported basis and 6.9% on constant currency basis. This includes one-time revenue of $23 million on account of termination of one of our contracts by client as a result of the internal restructuring. Excluding this impact, the pricing for the quarter has improved by 1.5% on reported basis and 2.4% on constant currency basis. However, on a year-on-year basis, pricing has declined by 6.4% reported basis and 1.7% in constant currency basis.", "During the quarter, our utilization, excluding trainees, went up from 80.2% to 81.3%. The utilization including trainees is marginally down at 75.4% as against 75.7% in the last quarter. As you're aware, the utilization in Q2 is generally lower because of the freshers, who joined the system during the quarter. Onsite mix remains flat at 29.2%.", "Our operating margins for the quarter was at 25.5%, an expansion of 150 basis points in the quarter. Margins in the quarter was helped by rupee depreciation against U.S. dollar by 2.7%, which was offset by increase in variable pay from 80% to 100%. The margin expansion was, therefore, mainly on account of increase in constant currency pricing of 2.4% and utilization increase of 1.1%. We added 17,595 gross employees in the quarter, with a net addition of 8,453 employees. Though the absolute attrition volume has seen a marginal increase, however, our quarterly annualized attrition has declined marginally to 14.1% from 14.2% last quarter. On consolidated group basis, annualized attrition was at 19.9% as against 19.2% last quarter.", "Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30 was at $4.894 billion compared to $4.75 billion as of June 30. Our cash flow from operations improved in the quarter due to strong focus on controlling the DSO. DSO for the quarter improved to 64 days as against 68 days in the first quarter.", "During the quarter, we have seen very volatile currency markets. On a quarter end exchange rate basis, U.S. dollar appreciated by 3% against INR, 8.5% against Australian dollar, and 3.4% against British pound. Considering the volatility, we believe our current hedging policy of taking short-term hedges in line with net assets in the balance sheet provide us adequate insurance against the volatility. We have outstanding hedges of $990 million as of the quarter end and we had an exchange gain of $8 million during the second quarter.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter is at 29%. This is in line with what we have guided in Q1. For FY 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 29% to 30% due to increases in statutory tax rates in India and also some of our SEZ units moving from 100% tax exemption to 50% tax exemption.", "Coming to the segment performance, in reported currency terms, North America grew by 6.1%, Europe grew by 8.3%, India increased by 9.4%, while Rest of the World grew by 0.8%. The growth in Rest of the World was affected by depreciation of Australian dollar against U.S. dollar by 8.1% during the quarter. Amongst verticals, retail grew by 7.9%, ECS by 5.9%, manufacturing by 5.5% and FSI by 5.2%.", "As we all know, this is my last earnings call. It has been an amazing 16 years of journey at Infosys including three years as CFO. I would like to thank each one of you for the tremendous support and guidance that you have provided me through the years. It has been an absolute pleasure working with all of you and I have always done something new in each of our interactions. I do hope that we'll continue to interact as friends in future. I wish you all the very best. Thank you once again.", "With this, I request Ranga to provide color on the guidance and the future outlook. Ranga?", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Executive VP & Head-Strategic Operations", "Thank you, Rajiv. Before I get to the guidance, first of all, I would like to say hello to everyone. This is Ranga here. It's great to connect with all of you today. I had an opportunity to meet several of you over the past few years in my earlier roles. It's good to connect again. It's indeed my privilege to lead a world-class finance team at Infosys. I have to say that, my illustrious predecessors Mohandas Pai, Bala and Rajiv have ensured that finance function plays a key role in the growth and success of the company. They have built a world-class finance team, which I'm proud of.", "Finance function at Infosys has always set new benchmarks. Whether it was the first ever U.S. listing by an Indian company or first ever adoption of IFRS by an Indian company are the most transparent financial reporting, finance function has always led from the front. So we will continue to focus on a smooth execution of our new-new strategy for consistent and profitable growth.", "Lastly, for all of us at Infosys, main source of strength is our core value system of integrity and transparency. Our founder Mr. Murthy, Nandan, Kris, Shibu, Dinesh and others, have established this solid foundation of core values and we will continue to draw strength from these core values. I look forward to connecting with all you over the next few weeks.", "Now coming back to guidance, we have retained our annual guidance of 10% to 12% in constant currency, so there is no change in our annual guidance. The second half traditionally has seasonal dips in growth. While it is endeavor to kind of closely monitor this, at this point in time, given certain short-term headwinds in a few accounts, we would like to maintain the guidance at 10% to 12%. Thank you. On this, are there any questions, we'll certainly address during the course of the call.", "Sandeep Mahindroo - Principal-Investor Relations", "Inba, we can open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. First question is from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good evening, good morning. I was wondering if you could sort of flesh out some of these short-term headwinds, what verticals, what particular reasons and are there \u2013 you said short-term, so are those spending pauses or is contracts being delayed or cancelled? Thank you.", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "Hey, Edward. This is Vishal. First of all, in all my engagements with clients, I see a \u2013 I mean, there is a huge shift happening in the industries around us and so the need for innovation \u2013 on the one hand, there is pricing pressure and a consistent and sustained downward pressure on pricing on the traditional IT services world and that is coming from the fact that many of the businesses in many industries are under pressure, under disruption, whether it is a short-term one with environmental effects around them or a structural one with the disruption that they're facing.", "However, in the same businesses, we see that there is always a need for innovative next-generation solutions that bring that value and immediacy of relevance to their businesses. So that will be our endeavor. While on the traditional side and, as I mentioned earlier and also Ranga mentioned, there is a seasonal aspect to this downturn that happens typically in Q3 and also in Q4 for the industry and certainly for Infosys. We are going to work hard to ensure that those new timeless kinds of value providing services, which is what Aikido and Zero Distance embody, produce enough of a value in the short term that we buck this trend. Having said that, perhaps Pravin can add some color on the industries where we see short-term challenges.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Chief Operating Officer & Director", "In the normal course, the industry has challenges in quarter three due to furloughs, which is predominant in the manufacturing vertical and to some extent in retail, and we also have lower working days in quarter three, so those are things which we have already factored earlier. But apart from that, we are also seeing some additional headwinds.", "In financial services, by and large, we are seeing good momentum, but we are seeing challenges in the insurance sub-segment. And in addition, we also expect to see a little bit more of impact from the furlough perspective because banks are also now looking at aggressively cost-cutting measures. So we anticipate some amount of further impact as well, which historically we had not seen in the past.", "Retail is another vertical where we had seen good traction in quarter two, but we do expect some amount of volatility, which is typical given the holiday season, and some of the spending will depend on how the holiday season pans out. So we do anticipate some softness in retail.", "In the manufacturing vertical, while we are seeing good traction in auto and high-tech, we are seeing some challenges in the aero industry. And also in the industrials where there is exposure to oil and gas or mining, we're seeing some challenges. So we do expect some additional impact here. Energy continues to be challenged because of the oil prices and we are now seeing a second wave of cost-cutting in the energy companies. So that also adds to some challenges.", "So these are some things which typically we don't see. Even though quarter three is historically soft, these are some of the additional challenges we anticipate in this quarter, and that's one of the reasons why we are talking about a soft H2.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "My other question is on realization, surprising, at least to me, strong this quarter. I was wondering if Rajiv could break that down a little bit. And why is realization strong?", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "During the quarter \u2013 this is a quarter where we have more working days, so we had one extra working day in U.S. and three extra working days in UK and Australia, because of which, we have seen an upside of about $17 million of revenue during the quarter. We have about 8,000 projects running at any point of time. And depending on which life cycle stage they are in, there would always be \u2013 a lot of maintenance projects would be in the transition phase. And based on the IFRS guidelines of revenue recognition, there would always be revenue recognized depending on when the transitions are getting completed, so this is a normal course of business, which will happen. But we are seeing certain upside in revenue on one or two projects because of that reason and we have seen about $17 million of revenue coming off because of additional working days.", "Also if you remember, we had announced the acquisition of Skava and Kallidus in June of last quarter. So the full quarter revenue has come into this quarter, which is an additional $6 million of revenue. So if you take $17 million plus $6 million and also the different project lifecycle, that is what explains why the pricing is showing improvement in this quarter.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, many thanks. I wanted to follow Ed's question, if I could. Could you talk, Rajiv, a little bit about pricing that you're seeing in the current order trends? In particular, Cognizant has suggested that pricing has become more competitive. If you could, give some characterization on the pricing trends in the last 90-plus days. Has the market become more competitive or is it staying fairly consistent? And then I have a follow-up.", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "I'll ask Pravin to answer that.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Hi. We continue to see pricing pressure in the run side of the business, and this is something not new. We have seen this in the past as well and that's something we have been consistently seeing. And this is something, a reality from our perspective at least, and we are working hard on our automation agenda, productivity improvement agenda. In the long run, that is the only way to counter it. So we are not seeing any unusual, more than usual level of pricing sensitivity in the market or aggressiveness. This is something which we have seen in the last several quarters and we expect to see it in the future as well.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Great. And my follow-up, if I could. If you could talk a little bit about how currency has impacted margins and what role you think currency will play in your margins as you look out over the next couple of quarters? Thank you very much.", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, during the quarter, we have seen rupee depreciate against the dollar by about 2.7%, which has given us a positive benefit of about 70 basis points on the margin. But however, we've seen a sudden appreciation of rupee against the dollar in the first 10 days of October and it's almost appreciated by almost about 1.5%, 2% already. So the rupee volatility is going to impact to margins and there is nothing you can do really in the short run on the reported margin front because of the rupee appreciation or deprecation.", "However, in the medium-term to long-term, this starts getting priced to the clients, because we are working towards a certain margin target, as our cost structures in different currencies start changing because of the volatility in currency, that automatically starts getting priced to the client. So in the medium-term to long-term, if you look at the last many, many years, we have seen rupee moving from INR 48 to INR 68 and then come back to INR 58, go back to INR 65, but our margins have remained in a narrowband. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, you'll see the impact of rupee appreciation/depreciation flow to the margins, but I think on a medium to long-term, I think it gets priced to the clients.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, great. Well, I wish you all the best in wherever your path holds. Thank you very much.", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ravi Menon, Elara Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "Hello. Thank you for the opportunity. First of all, Rajiv, I wish you best of luck. We've talked \u2013 interacted much, I wish you best of luck. And secondly, I have a question on this subcontracting that's my first question. You have seen an 11.4% increase Q-o-Q in USD terms. So how do you expect this to move going ahead? Is this mostly due to insufficient number of visas or due to a skill gap?", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "Ravi, thanks for all your wishes. Unfortunately, because of some mic problem \u2013 speaker problem, we couldn't hear your questions clearly. Could you just repeat your questions?", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "So I was saying the subcontracting, you've seen an 11.4% increase in Q-o-Q in USD terms. So how do you expect this to move going ahead? And this is mostly due to an insufficient number of visas or is it due to a skill gap?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think in \u2013 the new visas start becoming effective from October 1. So, typically towards the quarter two, June to September quarter, we normally have challenges, given a very high level of visa utilization and significant percentage of the sub-con spend is onsite. So to that extent, we have \u2013 I mean what we have seen this quarter is because of that reason. But over a period of time, when the new visas start kicking in, it also takes time. Even though the visa is effective October 1, we have to apply for petition and there is an appointment and there will be a backlog as well. So, the whole of this quarter, it takes us to get these visas actionized. So we will see some continued impact to some extent in quarter three but, or subsequently, it should taper down.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "All right, thank you for that. I have a second question to you, Pravin, if I may. You had indicated I think in an investor conference in New York that you've seasonally, though \u2013 traditionally Q2 has been stronger than Q1, but we shouldn't really expect that this year. But you have surprised us positively. So what areas have been the sources of positive surprise for this quarter compared to when you made your comments?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Chief Operating Officer & Director", "I think we have seen \u2013 this time, there has been all round growth, if you look at it. I mean, if you look at it from a geography perspective, we've seen good growth in Europe, good growth in Americas. And if you factor in normalized the Rest of the World for currency in Australia, then even we have seen good growth in Australia as well. And even across the verticals and service lines, we have seen good growth. The only verticals where we have seen some challenges were in insurance, telecom, then energy. Otherwise, by and large, it's been fairly positive. One part of it, obviously, we talked about the one-off revenues this quarter, impact of one-off revenues, so that's something which \u2013 which is a one-off thing. We shouldn't factor it.", "But some of the, I think, when I talked in the conference, we had not anticipated the kind of strong volumes and the momentum that kicked in from some of our earlier wins. So that was to some extent, we didn't anticipate at the beginning of the quarter but apart from that, I think rest of the performance has been on expected lines.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "All right, thank you. So if I might see a little bit on that, could you say that some say contracts that were in practice factored into revenue a little earlier? So can we say that it was (33:20) and got a little pulled in?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Chief Operating Officer & Director", "I think to some extent, we have a hole in the sense that we got this one-off $23 million revenue, so that we need to make up in quarter three. And moreover that account of project, which got cancelled would have contributed to some revenue, that's also something we need to backfill. So to that extent, we are starting quarter three on maybe a slightly lower point than what we would have normally anticipated. Then, I also talked about some of the additional headwinds that we have seen.", "If those materialize, then quarter three will continue to be soft. We are hopeful that \u2013 if those don't materialize, then we may end up little bit better. But as Vishal talked earlier, we have got many initiatives in place and our hope and expectation is that at least our endeavor is to make sure that we continue to focus on getting \u2013 at least driving some incremental growth in most of our accounts through all these initiatives. So, hopefully, it's not in quarter three, we will get some momentum back in quarter four. At this stage, we don't have the visibility, so that's why from a guidance perspective, we have guided for no change in the guidance and soft H2.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "Thank you, sir, and best of luck.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes, sir. Vishal, I just wanted to step back and ask kind of a big picture question. Since you've come onboard, several strategic changes. Can you help us understand how you've impacted two things? One is on the hiring front and one is the pricing front? On the hiring front, are you able to attract the new talent for these new initiatives? And on the pricing front, are your customers able to see \u2013 your new value add and are they paying for this?", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "So, Anand, yeah. The answer to both questions is yes. On hiring in the new areas, we are able to attract some world-class talent, which we have been able to do that. I think that talent attracts talent and so that's sort of the principle that has been at work here.", "On the renew side, again, in the traditional hiring side, as well we see tremendous interest. We see r\u00e9sum\u00e9s constantly from people who reach out to us from our competitors and others in the industry. So that has been actually a very encouraging sign. In terms of the pricing, the \u2013 I think that when we look at the traditional services and how they go through a transformation, we have to look at it differently than the way we look at completely new kinds of services.", "So, for instance, when we look at completely new kinds of services based on design, based on new kinds of platforms where unprecedented cross performance improvements can be delivered, or where had new kinds of applications using artificial intelligence and technologies like that can be delivered. We generally don't see any pricing issues and we are able to get higher margins and things of that nature. So on the new areas, because of the strong relevance and the strategic importance of these areas, we don't see, I think, there is an issue.", "When I look at traditional IT outsourcing or other forms of deals of the \u2013 more of the traditional IT services oriented deals, there we do see continuously downward pricing pressure and I believe that that is a structural trend. And the way we want to deal with that is through bringing, of course, first of all, operational excellence, but also by bringing much more use of automation by being proactive and bringing innovation into our projects.", "So, for instance, I will give you an example in Sandeep's area in logistics, one particular deal that we did with Panaya, was a deal \u2013 I'll just walk through one example of this. It's a testing deal using IVS. So this was one of the early examples where we were actually able to apply Panaya beyond their traditional area of packet system upgrades to a testing project. The entire project was for $370,000 over 18 months. We were able to, by the use of Panaya, eliminate 40% of the effort, and the Panaya license in there was for $100,000.", "So when you look at this kind of an example, we are transitioning from a people oriented model, which is under pricing pressure to a people plus software oriented model, where we are able to take advantage of the software to dramatically reduce the number of people necessary in a project. The software is higher margin, therefore the margin on the project for us improves because our ability to price the project attractive to the client goes up. And because we have less number of people working on it, our bandwidth improves because we can do more projects with less number of people. So it creates a virtuous cycle where we are able to deal with the downward pricing pressure in a way that is constructive for the client as well as for us.", "I believe that this is the recipe for the future. All the examples of software, the Ai of Aikido that I talked about are around this pattern that we are driving. And the more of these that we do, the better our ability to deal with the negative pricing pressure will continue to be. And our endeavor is to do hundreds of these kinds of projects across the company, and we are already doing ones, as I mentioned earlier in the call.", "So that is the way that we want to deal with the downward pricing pressure by bringing software into the mix that enables us to better differentiate our offerings, continue to improve our margins while improving the productivity of the people and thereby dealing with this. And I also believe that if we wait long enough and just wait for these pressures to become significantly stronger than they already are, then it will be more difficult to get the earnings \u2013 to get the margin improvements and things of this nature. So timing is essential, and that is why we are doubling down on scaling these innovative areas in how they can improve the effectiveness of our existing offerings now. And our goal is and our team is committed to this to bring these innovations to all of our top 200 clients, all the Aikido inventions to all top 200 clients by the end of this fiscal year.", "Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. And a quick follow-up, you talk about manufacturing and energy I think being soft beyond the seasonality. So does the second half quarter guidance assume the macro stays as it is, or is there further deterioration in these two areas?", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "No, it assumes the deterioration that we have already talked about and it takes that into account. We don't see further deterioration than that.", "Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC", "All right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Bourgeois of DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research", "Okay, great, guys. Hey, so investors are inquiring about the real implications of your latest guidance. So let me ask about how your overall demand outlook has changed over the past three to six months excluding the normal impacts of seasonality and excluding the one-off impact of that terminated client. In other words, it would be helpful to understand how your outlook for the second half has changed since the outlook and assumptions you had in place three to six months ago. I think the specific things investors are really trying to understand here is, are you in a situation now where the first half demand was stronger than you expected, but you're now worried that demand has dampened to some extent for the second half ,or perhaps you're just being extra careful with your guidance? If you could clarify on that, that would be great.", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "Maybe I can start and then, Praveen, you can add. If you look further out than the second half of this year, the new deal wins that we have had recently will certainly give us confidence in our ability to grow the business as well as the adoption of our innovation, which we are very serious about. It's something that gives us confidence in where we are going. But when you look at the near-term and what is happening in Q3 and Q4, you have to understand that a large amount of our business depends on our existing business. And therefore changes that happen in existing clients, especially downwards changes, have an immediate impact whereas buildup of this business takes a longer period of time.", "So all this work that we are talking about is governed to a much larger degree by the existing business and not so much by the new business that we have been winning. So in that sense, the demand environment has to be qualified to be a demand environment pertaining to the existing efforts that are ongoing at our clients when it comes to the near term. Does that make sense?", "Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research", "Yes.", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "So that is what the basis of the near-term \u2013 I mean 90-day cycle is basically governed by that, even though these large multiyear projects take a long time to get up and running and start and so forth. So we are very confident in where we are headed, and we are maintaining our yearly guidance. Also, we are maintaining our guidance to get to industry leading growth by next year. However, in this particular quarter ahead of us and possibly in the second half of the year, based on what we see \u2013 of course having said all of that, with the focus that our teams have showed in Q1 and Q2 and especially with the adoption of the innovations that I have been talking about, it will be our endeavor to work really hard to make sure that none of the stuff that we are talking about happens, and that we are able to beat the guidance. But based on what Pravin and I see today, it's just still early in the quarter. This is basically our guidance. So that's where we are.", "Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research", "Got it. So it sounds like you're feeling really encouraged about your new contract wins and the ramp-ups there. But you've got some issues in your existing client base that you started to see in Q2 and you have to be careful in case the pressures on your existing clients continue into the second half. Is that the summary?", "Vishal Sikka - Chief Executive Officer, Director & MD", "You, sir, have said it most eloquently. I have repeated this thing that I just told you probably 35 times today, and what you have just said is the most eloquent capture of the situation.", "Rod Bourgeois - DeepDive Equity Research", "It is \u2013 it's great. Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Surendra Goyal of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Mr. Surendra Goyal, your line is unmuted. Please go ahead with your question.", "Surendra Goyal - Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd.", "Hi, good evening. Can you hear me? Hello.", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Surendra, we can hear you. Go ahead.", "Surendra Goyal - Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd.", "So this question is for Rajiv. Just looking at the cash flow statement, in the first half FY 2016, net cash provided by operating activities is down significantly Y-o-Y. In that context, could you specifically tell us what the line prepayment and other assets in the cash flow statement covers? It seems to have impacted cash flows by around $260 million in the first half versus almost no impact last year? Thanks.", "Rajiv Bansal - Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, give me a second, I'll just open the cash flow. See, we have not seen anything significant in the first \u2013 first quarter, we had a dividend payout. Second quarter, we paid out a dividend tax. We also had the impact of rupee depreciation and also what is happening now is \u2013 earlier, we used to get interest on our fixed deposits. See, most of our cash is lying as fixed deposits with the multiple banks in India. Earlier, we used to get quarterly interest, and we used to redeposit them but what we started doing when we saw the interest rate started falling, we have kept them on a compounding basis. So instead of getting interest payments every quarter and then reinvesting, we instruct all the banks to reinvest them so that we get the compounding benefits. So, that is the reason, what you see is though the interest gets exclude, it clearly doesn't get paid to us. And that is what also hit by the cash flows.", "So, last quarter, we've also had DSOs going up to 68 days. So I think other than the DSOs going up marginally last quarter, dividends being paid out, and the change in our \u2013 the interest payments on the banks that we initiated because of falling interest rates, there's been no major change in our cash flow.", "Surendra Goyal - Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd.", "Rajiv, just to clarify, I am talking of operating cash flows, not really investing activities. So if you look at the cash flow, there is a line called prepayment and other assets, which has impacted negatively \u2013 the cash flows negatively by $262 million, while last year first half there was practically no impact. So that's the line specifically that I'm asking about.", "Sandeep Mahindroo - Principal-Investor Relations", "Thanks. So I think Rajiv answered that. Basically we are reinvesting the interest component that we earlier used to collect, that is being reinvested and that appears as a prepayment. So once we collect that, you'll see an improvement in cash flow to that extent.", "Surendra Goyal - Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd.", "Okay. Okay, Sandeep. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo - Principal-Investor Relations", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Thanks and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

Thank you and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks Inba. Hello, everyone and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q3 FY 2016 financial results. I'm Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Let me start by wishing everyone a very happy 2016. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath; along with other members of the senior management team.", "We will start the call with some remarks on the performance of the Company by Dr. Sikka followed by comments by the leadership team. Subsequently, we will open up the call for questions.", "Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything which we say with respect to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk that the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'd now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Vishal Sikka", "Thank you, Sandeep and good evening and good morning and thanks for joining our call. To start with I want to recognize the spirit and the passion of all Infosians, which in many ways define our performance in the third quarter. We entered this last quarter somewhat apprehensive about what was ahead.", "Q3 is known for its seasonality, the furloughs, the less number of working days et cetera and we were coming off an amazing Q2 performance and then we were faced with the devastating flood in Chennai last month, but despite all of this because of the spirit and the passion of our people.", "I am pleased with what we achieved and the momentum that this has created for us to end the fiscal year on a strong note. We ended Q3 of FY 2016 with revenue of $2.407 billion. This translates to a quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.7% in rupee terms, 0.6% in U.S. dollar terms and 1.1% in Q2 constant currency.", "Year-on-year, our revenue has grown 12.5% in constant currency. If we adjust for the one-time early termination fee paid to us by a client in the last quarter, our quarter-on-quarter revenue growth came in better than expected at 2.1% in constant currency and 1.6% in reported terms. Volumes grew by 3.1% indicating a healthy momentum in the underlying business.", "Utilization including trainees was 74.2% and 80.6% excluding trainees. Blended per capita revenue decreased 2.5% as a result of lesser price realization. If we adjust for the one-time termination fee impact realized in Q2, pricing decreased by 1.5%.", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 24.9% compared to 25.5% in the previous quarter. We reported EPS of INR15.16 for the quarter and in U.S. dollar terms EPS was $0.23. Margins were impacted due to the seasonality of price realization that is typical of the third quarter and for some other reasons that Ranga can talk about.", "Attrition for the quarter decreased further to 13.4% on an LTM basis, and Infosys is now home to 193,000 employees. I mentioned our utilization earlier, our Zero Bench program which is aimed at rethinking the notion of the bench that prevails in our industry has seen great adoption.", "More than 8,000 projects have or are being worked upon by more than 4,000 people, while they await for client projects. This is giving them valuable real life experience that doesn\u2019t take to our clients and in the process they are creating software assets for our own use that are value to us.", "Our outlook for the rest of this financial year is positive. Therefore, we are raising our revenue growth position for the full-year to 12.8% to 13.2% in constant currency terms. This is ahead of our original annual guidance of 10% to 12% in constant currency. We expect that this will put us in a good position as we head into FY 2017 and on our way to industry leading growth. Ranga will touch upon some of the increased cost that we see on the horizon due to visa fees, et cetera and where we think we will end up in March.", "Now, let me talk about some of the key development of this quarter in the execution of our strategy to reimagine services in which we bring all that is possible with human potential together with software and services, while we still have a long way to go we see many promising milestones.", "We continue to focus on changing the nature of our conversations with clients to become much more strategic and we can see this reflected in the renewal of existing large contracts. Opening of new types of engagements and net new accounts as well as signing of large deals.", "The number of $50 million plus clients grew to $51 million and the number of $10 million plus clients grew to $171 million. We also added 34 net new clients during the quarter. Our momentum of large deal wins continued and we won four large deals in the quarter with nearly $350 million in contracted value across application maintenance, infrastructure management and in end package systems.", "In addition, we won a large renewal deal of around $600 million. The pipeline of large deals continuous to be healthy and in fact in the early weeks of this Q4, we have already signed new deals worth about $150 million.", "Our Financial Services segment under Mohit\u2019s leadership continued its strong performance with a 2.6% quarter-on-quarter growth in constant currency. China and India geographies also grew well for us in Q3.", "Now turning to the heart of our strategy innovation, we are driving innovation in two key ways. In our grassroots efforts to empower every Infosian as an innovator through programs like Zero Distance and in our reimaging of next generation services with our AiKiDo service offerings.", "Our Zero Distance program which focuses on driving innovation in every ongoing project that we do for every single client has continued to grow. We now have more than 8,000 Zero Distance projects more than 90% of our delivery organization under Ravi\u2019s dealership has already done something innovative in an existing project beyond the statement of work bringing value to our clients in every project.", "As recognized in many client surveys the innovation quotient of the organization has improved and Zero Distance has been recognized in employee surveys as the most impactful and engaging movement in the Company. When we talk about innovation at Infosys, we don\u2019t talk about a single department, but rather all of us as innovators. I believe this is a unique part of our strategy to change the nature of conversations that we have with our clients. We have begun to see these ideas deliver value for our clients as well.", "For example at TNT Express where we managed more than 721 applications in a complex landscape, we proactively identified an opportunity to our Zero Distance program to drive more value by using the Infosys automation platform to monitor their mainframe based messaging applications. This is enabling earlier detection and automatic resolution of incidence and resulting in higher business stability.", "We are at the same time seeing strong adoption of our new AiKiDo service offerings across all our industries. Clients continue to respond well to this framework as it looks to us for help in renewing their IT landscapes non-disruptively. This is the Ki of AiKiDo leveraging new platforms and technologies to open opportunities, which is the Ai of AiKiDo and bring the power of Design Thinking to find the great problems that they need to solve which is the door of AiKiDo.", "During the quarter we leveraged Ki to help clients modernize their legacy architectures, migrate existing application landscape to the cloud and leverage DevOps and agile methodologies and architectures for more agile landscapes.", "Commerzbank in Germany for example chose us for a multi-year application management program to develop a post trade utility for the bank, leveraging principles of Design Thinking and the AiKiDo framework to simplify application architecture to standardize and improve processes, and to drive cost efficiency.", "The Infosys Information Platform surpassed 200 engagements to date, with 30 already in production. I am particularly excited about our work with ATP, the Association for Tennis Professionals, where we are helping to reimagine the tennis experience. At the Barclays World Tour finals recently we analyze huge amounts of data from the Chair Umpire and from Hawk-Eye to deliver unprecedented foresights into each match and in doing this help to transform the fan experience.", "Infosys is working with Hershey\u2019s to build a predictive analytics capability using IIP. We have setup a data lake of close to a terabyte and 5.3 billion records on IIP for doing advanced analytical analysis to enable real time decision making in the supply chain area.", "The Infosys Automation Platform, IAP surpassed 121 engagements with 47 already in production. Automation is making it to be a more fundamentally into our services. I have said this before several times that automation and renewal are the answer to the decline that our industry is in the midst of due to the commoditization of traditional services.", "In this quarter we released more than 1,100 engineers compared to roughly 800 FTE in the last quarter and this was across our service lines. Infrastructure management and testing as well as BPO enterprise packages and the engineering services BI and Digital, automation impacts every single service that we deliver.", "Panaya, Skava and Edge solutions continue to see strong adoption. Our EdgeVerve unit had 24 wins and 25 go-lives for the Finacle and Edge platform offerings. With Panaya we closed 13 new joint engagements including one at BNSF, the North American Railroad Company for risk-based testing on their SAP landscape. Skava mobility service offering for retailers had a record Black Friday weekend with traffic and m-commerce sales up by 50%.", "In door our Design Thinking, our methodology to discover and articulate the most complex, the most strategic problems of our clients. We have conducted more than 151 engagements with clients to date led by our consulting teams. For example, we helped Aimia create their new market entry strategy by leveraging Design Thinking to evaluate the core needs of the market and its consumers and open the mind of their teams to think of creative solutions rather than focusing on predetermined ideas.", "More than 69,000 of our employees have now been trained in Design Thinking and clearly we can see the application of this across the board in helping us build better relationships with our clients and engaging with them on their strategic transformative projects. We continue to look for investment and partnership opportunities that bring additional value to our clients and that help position Infosys in a broader context.", "This quarter we can completed the acquisition of Noah Consulting, a leading consulting services for the oil and gas industry. We also invested in WHOOP, an early stage company that offers sports performance optimization system using variable solutions and we invested in CloudEndure, a startup that provides Cloud Migration and Cloud-based Disaster Recovery systems.", "We announced our participation in OpenAI a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and advancing artificial intelligence, bringing the best of AI talent in the world together in the interest of all of us. This initiative adds an important new dimension to our several ongoing efforts in artificial intelligence.", "We were named the Corporate Citizen of The Year, at the ET Awards last week for our CSR initiatives and purpose driven philanthropy done by our three foundations. The Infosys Foundation in India, the Infosys Foundation in the U.S.A. and the Infosys Science Foundation. We launched a new solar power plant in our campus in Hyderabad and now produce 7.2 megawatts of power with solar, which helps meet all 100% of the delivery centers recruitments in Hyderabad.", "Before I hand it over to my friend Ranga, who had his first quarter as our CFO. I want to congratulate all Infosians on being ranked second in the business world overall list of most respected companies, especially because the award cited our belief in self as the reason for our winning. This reflects my own belief in the unlimited potential that all of us have. The future is something that we invent that we make as my friend and teacher Alan Kay often reminded us.", "People ask me about all these other factors like what is happening in the broader economy, what is happening in China, how we compare ourselves with other some digital services and so on while lot of these are important they all remain things that we react to that we respond to. The more important part is we are only limited by our imaginations. And in this way I am very optimistic for the path that we are creating that we are making for ourselves as well as for our clients.", "Thank you very much and I would now hand it over to Ranga.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Thank you, Vishal. Hello, everyone and wish you all a very happy 2016 ahead. On the big picture our revenues in Q3 were $240.7 million this is a quarter-and-quarter growth of 0.6% sequentially in dollar terms and 1.1% in constant currency terms. On a year-on-year basis Q3 revenues have grown 8.5% in dollar terms and 12.5% in constant currency terms.", "If you recall in Q2 we had a one-time revenue of $23 million due to a contact termination, after taking into account the termination our quarter-on-quarter growth is 1.6% in dollar terms and 2.1% in constant currency terms. Q3 is a seasonally soft quarter due to the impact of furloughs, and lower working days. Growth in Q3 was better than our earlier expectation since the impact of some furloughs was lower than what we anticipated.", "We were also able to overcome the client specific headwinds to some extent. We also had to navigate through unexpected events such as Chennai floods. However, our effective business continuity plans ensure that there was negligible impact of the same on our revenues. During the quarter we acquired Noah, which resulted in additional $3 million revenues for Q3.", "Volumes grew by 3.1% during the quarter, marginally lower than 3.7% in Q2. Realization for the quarter declined by 2.5% on reported basis and 2% in constant currency basis. If we normalize the impact of contract termination in Q2 decline in realization was 1.5% in reported terms and 1% in constant currency terms. Furloughs and lower working days in Q3 also impacted the realization to some extent.", "On a year-on-year basis realization was lower by 4.5% in reported terms and 1.1% in constant currency terms. Our utilization excluding trainees declined by 70 basis points to 80.6% during the quarter, so utilization including trainees declined by 120 basis points to 74.2% due to additional of trainees during the quarter. Onsite mix increased marginally to 29.5% as a result of growth in certain consulting and SI services projects, which has a higher onsite component.", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 24.9% a decline of 60 basis points during the quarter. Margin for the quarter were impacted by 110 basis points due to realization decline and another 60 basis points due to dropping utilization, increase in subcon cost and impact of Nova consolidation. This was offset by 110 basis points due to benefits resulting from both rupee depreciation and reduction in variable pay there by limiting the margin drop to 60 basis points.", "At the group level we added 14,027 employees during the quarter with a net addition of 5,407 employees. Attrition continues to be on the declining trend. The group level annualized attrition was 18.1% as against 19.9% last quarter. The quarterly annualized attrition on a standalone basis for Infosys Limited has declined to 13.4% from 14.1% last quarter. This is at par with the lowest level of attrition in the last 15 quarters.", "Operating cash flow generation was stable during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $474 million in Q3 as compared $480 million in last quarter. We paid out interim dividend and dividend distribution tax of $423 million and $102 million towards deferred consideration on purchase of Lodestone.", "CapEx during the quarter was $103 million hence our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31 was $4.765 billion as compared to $4.894 billion last quarter.", "DSO for the quarter was 65 days. In parallel, we had a reduction of $74 million of unbilled revenues in Q3 and they fell to the lowest level in the last two years. We saw another quarter of U.S. dollar strength against most currencies, rupee depreciated against dollar by 1.1% on an average basis and 0.9% on period end basis. U.S. dollar appreciated 2.3% against the euro and 2.2% against the UK pound.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2% this included tax reversals due to completion of tax assessments in certain jurisdictions. Excluding this, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30% which is within that 29% to 30% ban that we had indicated earlier.", "Our net margins during the quarter were 21.8% compared to 21.7% last quarter. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.23. EPS grew 0.9% on a sequential basis and 0.4% on year-on-year basis. Coming to the segments performance almost amongst verticals. FSI, which is Financial Services and Insurance grew by 2.7%, Energy, Communication and Services grew by 4.2% while retail and manufacturing declined by 0.5% and 3.7% respectively.", "Amongst the geographies Europe grew by 2.1%, North America declined by 0.6% while the rest of the world was flat. Q3 growth in Americas and manufacturing was negatively impacted since Q2 revenues included $23 million from contract termination that I mentioned earlier.", "India grew by 23.1% due to ramp up of few projects. The growth in India should be seen in the context of the small base of business which sees changes due to ramp ups and ramp downs in projects. During the quarter we added 13 clients above 1 million, 4 clients above 25 million and one client above 50 million.", "Our share of revenues from fixed-price contracts increased further during the quarter to 44.6%. Our revenues from top five clients declined by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and from top 10 clients declined and it was flat actually 0.1% QoQ decline. However, on a year-on-year basis of revenues from top five clients grew by 13% and from top 10 clients grew by 9.4% which is higher than the Company average growth for the respective period.", "Coming to guidance for the quarter, our earlier guidance for FY 2016 was 10% to 12% in constant currency terms. Based on our performance in the last three quarters, we are increasing our constant currency guidance to 12.8% to 13.2% this translates to 8.9% to 9.3% growth in dollar terms. On operating margins, we expect our medium term bank to be 25% plus or minus one as ended.", "And with that we will open the floor for questions.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Now we can start the Q&A part.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Hi, good evening. Congratulations on a good quarter. I was curious of the impact that you expect from the recent increase in the visa fee rates and also another company we follow indicated that there is a new bonus rule that was just enacted on a retroactive basis and we are wondering if that was impacting you?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "On the visa \u2013 this is Ranga here. On the visa part there are two companies to it, one is what are the additional charges for the new applications that we put that has gone up by $2,000 per application. And there is a second component wherever we extend the visas beyond a certain period that component is up by about $4,000. There is some amount of clarities still required under second piece because we\u2019ve heard different versions and different notifications.", "However, assuming that it is $2,000 for the first and $4,000 for the second and if we assume that we \u2013 for the next year we will have a similar additional visa applications and visa extensions. Based on our current estimate it\u2019s about 30 basis points to 35 basis points for the next year. That\u2019s our current estimate. However, this is based on the current information that we have on the visa changes.", "And the second part, yes, this particular thing primarily applies to our BPO employees, not on Infosys Limited employees. I think the aggregate impact is very negligible.", "Edward Caso", "Okay, terrific. I noticed that the \u2013 my other question is on the infrastructure business that we're seemed a bit soft this quarter and it had been particularly strong in a while is that anything in particular to call out?", "Vishal Sikka", "Edward this is Vishal. No it was a result of the one-timer determination that was paid to us by our client in Q2 that was in the infrastructure area that ended up giving the number in this previous quarter. We are growing infrastructure very well, we are \u2013 in fact our infrastructure offering has never been stronger and both from the prospective of the I mean infrastructure is the first beneficiary of automation.", "So the largest contributor to that 1100 people that I mentioned saving was in infrastructure and we have been pumping a lot of effort into bringing automation into all aspects of infrastructure management, but also working closely with our partners especially Amazon and Microsoft, but also others like EMC and others and helping to bring this Cloud Migration and some of the next generation elastic infrastructure offerings.", "And also on the innovation side we have been doing a ton of work with start-up companies, we have invested in Vertex Ventures which is an exclusively next generation infrastructure focused venture funds as well as we just did an investment and CloudEndure in the disaster recovery area and infrastructure services a Ki requirement for many of our plants. So I believe that our infrastructure offering has never been stronger and we are quite bullish on that.", "Edward Caso", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri of Sterne Agee.", "Moshe Katri", "Thanks, congratulations and Happy New Year. Okay question on realization, which was down during the quarter. Can we get some more \u2013 maybe some more details on some of the drivers here? Does it have to do with the new mix of business and then how comfortable are we back, given the new mix of businesses coming on board that we're going to be able to sustain the margins that we're targeting?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, Moshe, Ranga here. You can look at the realizations on sequential basis declined by 2.5% and reported and constant currency 2% and if you compared on an apple-to-apple basis with the previous quarter after taking to account that one-time terminations and sequential decline is 1.5% reported and 1% in constant currency.", "And likewise between quarter-to-quarter there will be a couple of items which will in the short-term change this decline. In our opinion the year-on-year is probably a more broader trend. When we look at the year-on-year in reported terms it was 4.5% decline and in constant currency terms 1.1% decline. That\u2019s a broad picture on the actual numbers.", "Vishal Sikka", "And hey Moshe, Happy New Year. Beyond the specific numbers that Ranga talked about I mean if you look at on the yearly basis, pricing declined by 4.5% on reported terms and 1.1% on constant currency. So there is clearly a larger scale, structural downward trend here that is at play and I have been talking about that obviously for the last several quarters.", "We believe that there are \u2013 I mean there are of course seasonal fluctuations in this and some quarters where it goes up and something where it\u2019s not as bad. But generally if there is no doubt that there is a declining pricing pressure and my sense is that there are a whole bunch of operational levers that we can test, we can improve \u2013 to improve this around the utilization obviously but also the onsite mix and the roll ratios and things of this nature.", "But clearly the big thing to be done here is automation. And I mentioned I am encouraged that we have demonstrated this revenue of about 1,100 engineers in the last quarter because of automation. We need to bring this number up significantly and we are working on that as we look to the financial year ahead of us this is one of our key priorities to lastly expand the scope of automation. Both in terms of how we bring it to all our projects I mean so far we have been applying it to a subset of our projects, which are more fixed price in nature and so forth, but to also apply these to a much broader range of our projects.", "But also going beyond that to higher quality of automation meaning going beyond the more mechanisable, repeatable tasks, the tasks requiring more of the troubleshooting diagnostics, the more complex understanding of text, natural language processing, machine learning kinds of activities, which helps us get into the higher level kinds of tasks that our people perform.", "And even in application development, which is a much more non-mechanisable kind of the task to improve the experience of the developers to simplify the tooling to find framework that can simplify the developers experience. So, automation is the long-term counter to this structural downward pricing pressure that we see.", "Moshe Katri", "Thank you, for that. Just as a follow-up, the PCB number was significantly below of what we've seen a quarter before you did indicate on the first I think in your press conference that you had a couple of deals that was signed later after the quarter closed. Was there a deal slippage issue here? Maybe you can kind of get us some more color on that.", "Vishal Sikka", "Yes, couple of the deals slipped out of Q3 into Q4 we have in fact signed them I mentioned earlier we have already signed $150 million worth of those and we are on the verge in the next few days of signing another one. But that is I don\u2019t deal anything into that we are in a holiday season and so forth these are long-term projects so it doesn\u2019t matter.", "We have already I mean we see a quite a healthy pipeline in large deals of getting close to $3 billion that we see right now. And when we look at the previous when we look at Q3 we did about somewhere a little bit more than $300 million of something like $367 million worth of large deals already and then if you count one large financial services deal that we did, by our technical definition we don\u2019t count in this manner, but it was in the neighborhood of $600 million.", "So they do add up already to [define] deals add up to close to a billion anyway and then we have done more now. So our deal wins the win-ratio and deals has improved significantly compared to the past and we feel quite good about what is happening in the large deals area.", "Moshe Katri", "Thanks for the color. Congratulations.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi, let me echo my congratulations on the good start to the calendar year and to the fiscal year. I want to ask about the strategy regarding mining the top clients. You know that's really served you well over the first six quarters of your tenure Vishal. The Top 10, 5 and 1 did decline just marginally as a percentage of revenue in fiscal Q3. I guess my question is, as you look to achieve your mid and longer term objectives in 2017 and up to 2020, how important are the top clients in the initiatives to get you to your plans?", "Vishal Sikka", "They are very important James the top 5, 10 and 25 clients are a very key focus area for us. I keep an eye on that myself and our entire leadership team does as well. The number that you saw in the last quarter were a result of the seasonalities that I talked about in fact our relationship with our top clients has never been stronger, has never been more strategic than it is now.", "We are quite excited about the kind of engagements that we are starting to get into with our large clients in the new areas in Design Thinking and structural programs in large scale landscape renewals and mainframe modernizations things of this nature.", "If you look at the revenue from the top five clients there was a 0.3% decline quarter-on-quarter and then top 10 it was 0.1% quarter-on-quarter, but on a year-on-year basis the revenue from the top five clients grew by 13% and for the top 10 clients grew by 9.4% which is both are higher than the Company average growth and our top most clients has grown by 21.5% on a year-on-year basis.", "So from a mining perspective, from a strategic relationship perspective the top clients continue to be a huge area of strength for us, of growth for us and I can say anecdotally that our relationship with the top clients has never been stronger.", "James Friedman", "It's a great answer Vishal. I wanted if I could follow-up with one from the overnight. I think Pravin had mentioned that he anticipated the budgets would be flat to down for calendar 2016. You're saying you assigned a $150 million already year-to-date. I guess my question is $150 million a lot or a little. What reference point would we have for that as you start the calendar year?", "Vishal Sikka", "I mean it\u2019s just the first week, working week of the year. So I think we are excited about that obviously, but we don\u2019t read anything into it. It is just a way that the timing of these deals I know that\u2019s happening. We have already been awarded another \u2013 verbally awarded several $100 million worth of deals already within this year. So like I said earlier we are feeling good about the large deal pipelines.", "In terms of the response that Pravin gave earlier and Pravin can add to this. We do see a downward pressure on the budgets especially in IT and the imperative that IT and last night \u2013 late last night I was talking to one of our clients in Texas and I was \u2013 there is this ongoing priority to find savings in the ongoing renewal of their landscapes and then using those savings to fund the growth initiatives and things like that.", "So even though the budgets are flat to declining, if we are able to be agile, to be able to redeploy projects and resources and if we are able to transform both the help with the renewal of their existing landscapes to simplify these, move to the cloud, find the savings, find the optimization and in parallel sort of their needs, their burden on the next generation digital client oriented strategic initiatives around creating new experiences for consumers and so forth.", "Then even though these budgets are under pressure, our growth can continue to be strong. And that is something that I wanted to make sure that the declining pressure on clients budgets is not the same as our inability to take advantage of that.", "Pravin Rao", "Pravin here. Just to add to that I don\u2019t think there is any disconnect between the two metrics because whenever the budgets are under pressure, clients will look at more outsourcing and will look at cost savings and today when you look at the business and IT operation side of things there is tremendous pressure on cost, clients are typically looking at 15%, 20% savings for doing similar things. And that\u2019s eventually will naturally will translate into large deals. So you will continue to see a healthy pipeline of large deals and particularly more so and there is a lot of pressure on the budgets.", "James Friedman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi, thank you very much. I have two questions. You've mentioned that Infosys you believe can achieve industry leading growth as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months I think starting after the conclusion of this March quarter. I want to try to revisit what do you think industry growth potential is if you look out over the course of the next 12 plus months?", "Vishal Sikka", "I mean right now our visibility based on what we have said concretely on the near-term is that based on what we see from the part of your power business execution within this quarter we\u2019ll get to 12.8 to 13.2 in constant currency terms for this current financial year and we\u2019ll share our guidance for the next year in the April timeframe, but looking at where the industry is at and where the atmosphere in the clients is at I feel quite confident and that will get to the industry leading growth in the coming financial year.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Let me try this one and is you\u2019ve mentioned that if we normalize for the payment that occurred in the previous quarter, you've given some constant currency realization. You've also indicated that year-over-year realization was down about 1%, which was due to pricing? Is that what we should expect going forward, do you think you said that pricing pressure will probably part of what you face should we be thinking about realization trends down in the 1% range year-over-year as we look out over the next couple of quarters or over the course of calendar year 2016?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Well, this is Ranga here. Yes, if you look at as you\u2019ve said that we\u2019ve had a reported basis 4.5% and constant currency 1.1%. And at least in the short-term this is the trend that we see in the short-term, but it is difficult to predict over a long horizon or even in the medium-term horizon what could be the trend line be, but at this point in time yes this is a broad trend that we see at this juncture, but it is difficult to kind of translate into medium-term trend line.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll see in the floor. Many thanks gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just I had a couple of questions. From a pricing perspective, Infosys has been quite vocal about it\u2019s willingness to be flexible and pricing and we are even seeing that in your overall pricing. Are your existing clients, particularly ones coming up for renewals asking for pricing breaks? And the second thing is you mentioned to automation you had saved about like 1100 engineers. Does it translate about like $50 million or $60 million or can you just give us some context of what does that translate into a dollar terms?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "On the 1100 people that we saved that it is too smaller number, right now I mean that\u2019s like less than around 1% of our delivery force. So it is difficult to start to put a tangible number on it. As we get closer to that point where these numbers become more substantive and we can start to assign dollars and percentages to them. We\u2019ll let you know, I expect that to happen over the next few quarters if not sooner, but that is the \u2013 what was your other question.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Are your existing clients, particularly ones coming up for renewal, are they coming and asking for pricing breaks? Or is the pricing mostly among kind of new client signups?", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here. We are not - on the rate card perspective we are not seeing any clients coming back and asking for any price discounts, it\u2019s only when the deal comes up for renewal whenever it\u2019s a competitive bit, there is a aggressive pricing because of the competitive nature of the deal and clearly expects 30%, 35% savings. So that\u2019s the trend we are seeing and that\u2019s where we are having the talk about pressure on pricing on the business and IT operation side of business, that is the reality we are seeing. But on the rate card there is not too much of a pressure.", "Arvind Ramnani", "So would it be fair to say these are mostly kind of new client signing-ups?", "Pravin Rao", "It\u2019s a mix of both I mean there are some deals where we are incumbent and when it comes up for a renewal plans put it out for competitive bit. There are deals where we are not incumbent so it\u2019s a combination of both. And over the last few quarters when we look at large deal wins that we have announced, it\u2019s been a mix of new logos as well as existing, new wins in existing clients.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Great. That's helpful. And just a separate question on - I realized at this point some of your questions, but your clients are still finalizing budgets, however, do you have some sort of initial feedback on budgets and how you\u2019re feeling this year compared to last year when it comes to the kind of client budget?", "Vishal Sikka", "I think see overall the sense we get this budget will [indiscernible] remain flat in some industries maybe marginally up but end up flat or marginally down. Only industry where we can talk with confident where we are seeing lot of pressure is on the energy side where there is lot of pressure because of the oil prices there is definitely pressure and budget cuts, but in other cases budgets are typically flat. On a client-by-client basis it varies a little bit. And its similar to the trend we saw in the last year as well.", "In some sense the notion of budget the annual budget and cycles on the annual budget which we use to see in the past is no longer there given all the volatility many times, we are seeing budget resets on a quarterly basis. So and that is what we would expect given the continued volatile nature of the business. Overall every client is looking at taking cost out and repurposing that savings into newer areas, new transformation areas and so on and that pattern we expect to see in this year as well.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Great and I just let this one more and I'm hearing from many firms that they're growing and expanding their the capital operations in India. And that as they are sort of expanding the captive, do you look at it as a positive, because you have a role in expansion or do you look it as a negative where some of the work that have gone to Infosys is now going to a captive?", "Vishal Sikka", "Its not such a big shift that is mix any material difference to what we do. We have in fact we\u2019ve helping some of our clients that setting up of their operation so couple of large companies in the financial services industry and we have in fact recouping and training that employees as well as taking over more of their work so creating a true symbiotic partnership that our employees and their employees work together seamlessly and of course they have exceptional expertise and infrastructure and facilities and the operating environment which helps out a lot.", "So we see both kinds of moments and in some cases our client to set up captive but in other cases they hand over their captives to us or even we provide them help and services in establishing their captives. And then we also some of the work that we have been doing we invested in this ANSR, which is a new kind of set up creation entity here and - who heads our M&A and Corporate Venturing she visited these folks in last couple of days. That is an exiting new dimension but again these things are all not of a large enough scale that it makes a difference right now.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Thank you very much and good luck for rest of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joe Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I wonder if I could ask the pricing question a little bit different. Has your go-to-market, the pricing that you typically use in negotiating deals. Are you now changing that philosophy and pricing more aggressively to take market share as we start to see some of the work you commoditized?", "Pravin Rao", "Absolutely not - we\u2019ve in fact we believe that as we improve our engagement with clients and as we bring more and more sophistication and high value into our proposal process and into our engagement. We see that there is \u2013 that we have be actually end up having much more differentiated conversations by doing that. So obviously there is a pricing pressure especially in areas there we already have existing relationships or even when we end up getting new opportunity.", "But the key is always to get ahead of that wave, that wave is there we know that it is coming and it is already here, but the key is to be ahead of that by virtue of a combination of automation that helps improve our productivity faster than the decline in the curve and by virtue of innovation that helps us move especially move our people and our capabilities higher up in the value chain towards things like more innovative projects more next generation, experience and intelligence system oriented projects or in particular using things like Design Thinking and helping identify the most important problems and most game changing kind of opportunities for clients.", "So I know that there are folks in the industry who talk about the fact that we are sort of lowering prices and so far they want to categorically deny that and \u2013 talk instead about the fact that we are relying heavily on our innovative offerings in AiKiDo and \u2013 that become more and more a part of the mix that we offer to their clients, which makes our propositions more attractive.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. And then just on digital. I know you stayed away from percentages of revenues from digital, but maybe you could give us some idea of what that investment is costing you and any kind of color around the financial associated with how you're participating. So in another words are you having to invest heavily there is that coming in at a lower margin, and any goalpost secure to put around percentage of revenue of growth rates?", "Vishal Sikka", "So I haven\u2019t stayed away from percentages at all. In fact I have consistently said that 100% of our revenue is digital \u2013 we write software for digital computers. Joking aside, I think what people mean by digital is areas where traditionally where heretofore physical experiences and engagements are becoming digitized for the first time like experiences inside stores or creating new channels, which were not there before for engaging with clients and so on.", "And on these kinds of projects we have tremendous expertise and tremendous growth happening in these kinds of projects. We do a lot of work in there obviously Skava the technology that we acquired helps us to get a tremendous leap ahead. I mean they had nearly doubled the volume on mobile, commerce over Black Friday that just went by and so on.", "So we don\u2019t see any particular need to invest any more than we are already doing there, we will continue to do that as a part of our normal course of business. I mean this is a service line for us and it is doing well. We have the right ability to teach people there and wherever necessary we hire and we obviously also acquire where necessary. It is true that the nature of those projects is different from the traditional large IT projects or outsourcing projects, these are smaller projects with using a more fragmented collection of technologies and so forth, but that is a way that particular part of business is.", "One other dimension of that business is something that we are extremely excited about and we have done a lot of leading work on which is in the area of the digitization of the physical world as manifested in the manufacturing and engineering areas, Internet of Things and creating digital trends and things like that. That is an area where we have been growing significantly, our engineering services work, which is largely in that area had significant growth in the last quarter.", "We have announced the strategic partnership with GE, we have done a lot of work with companies like Mitsubishi in helping design airplanes using new techniques, airplane structures through the large structures and so forth, working with companies like ALSTOM and others. So overall this endeavor of the software eating the world or the physical infrastructure becoming digital is a huge area of growth for us and I believe that we are well positioned in that area.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. And then last one from me, we've talked about margins, and a plus or minus 1% and we've seen pricing obviously start to continue to decline because visa costs coming in there. And then there are some investments in kind of upgrading the skills for digital. Are you still comfortable with that band going forward or how should we think about the margin profile if we want to?", "Vishal Sikka", "So for now we are comfortable with that band of 25 plus or minus 1 and our aspiration is to get to 30% by 2020 and the more time that goes by the more comfortable we feel in seeing a path to get there. Obviously we are not going to get there in the near-term, but we do feel comfortable that with the moves that we are making we have a trajectory to get there. If that ever changes, we\u2019ll let you know, but for know I feel quite comfortable with that. Ranga you want to add anything to that.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Yes, Vishal that\u2019s right. We continue to reiterate our medium-term goal of 25% plus or minus. If you look at the first nine months of the current year, we have been at 24.8%. Well, I think at the same time there are certain short-term levers and certain levers which by definition are more medium-term in nature. For example, the short-term lever is really in terms of utilization where our utilization as you noticed is 80.6.", "However, if you look that about a year ago, we used to be in late 70\u2019s now consistently in the last four quarters we have been just above 80. And we believe that there is scope for us to improve our utilization beyond what we have at the current level. Likewise, if you look at our on-site mix is at 29.5%. It has gone up by 1% year-on-year and we do have some levers there, but that\u2019s some more gradual lever than the utilization. Likewise, the subcontractor cost or the on-site ratios and employee costs as the percentage of revenues. These are some of the levers something like utilization is more short-term and productivity improvement that Vishal touched upon really is a lever to automation that we hope to kind of counter some of these pressures, but that\u2019s more like medium-term.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rishi Jhunjhunwala of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Yes, thanks for the opportunity. Vishal, one question around the demand environment going into next year. So if you look at it, there is clearly macro uncertainty around the world. We have seen kind of commoditization in the maintenance business and discretionary hasn\u2019t picked up back well. And clearly there are some verticals, specific headwinds that the industry is facing. So with all that in the backdrop, do you see any areas which can potentially take demand higher next year versus this year or is it going to be more a function of wait and watch?", "Vishal Sikka", "I mean there is \u2013 Rishi there is always a \u2013 we operate our business in this greater economic environment. And there is obviously a lot of anxiety that\u2019s around what is happening in China and with oil and things of this nature, but by and large there are huge growth areas in the world around us, there are huge growth market as well as in the big disruption that is happening and if you just look at the mainframe footprint in the world around us there is a massive mainframe footprint and we are very uniquely positioned to help our businesses safely, reliably, non-disruptively move off of this old mainframe stuff towards modern, agile dramatically cheaper cloud infrastructure.", "And the other opportunities I mean the conversion that we are having with Digital earlier in the previous question. So could there be things that happen that affect us all so badly that things goes out, of course, but looking at the way I see the near-term future I see that the when the times are bad there is need for innovation and when the times are good there is need for innovation.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Thanks. And the second thing is more on your target or basically aspiration over a five-year period on revenues and margins. So clearly, looking at the current trajectory, we are kind of on-track to achieve $20 billion and we have acquisitions and other things to achieve around that.", "But on the margin side with the medium term, range that we're talking about is it fair to assume that a large part of the margin improvement will be back ended and that too despite the potential acquisition revenues that we might have over the next 3 years to 5 years. Just wanted to understand, basically how it can potentially play out and then result in improvement in our revenue per employee metrics?", "Vishal Sikka", "The way I see that I mean it is still early and this is still an aspirational goal $20 billion, 30% and $80,000 and revenue per employee, but as time goes by we got closer to it gets more in reach and we start to see paths to get there. My sense is that the $20 billion, a curve that points to $20 billion will show up first then the curve that points to the 30% margin and then the curve that points to the $80,000 revenue per employee.", "Right now if you look at the situation the revenue per employee is in fact going down because the pricing pressure is higher and the utilization and operational improvement haven\u2019t kicked in yet and in particular the benefits of automation haven\u2019t kicked in yet enough to compensate for that, but I expected that will happen. Although, again in terms of the slopes of those three curves, the first curve to flatten out will be the revenue growth curve, the second one is with the margin and the third one will be the revenue for employee. That is my sense right now.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Great. Thank you and best of luck.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question. I now hand the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for spending time with us on this call. We look forward to interacting with you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of Infosys that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. And you may now disconnect your lines."]}

And over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks Serena. Hello, everyone and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q4 and FY16 earnings release. This is Sandeep from the Investor Relations team. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath; along with other members of the senior management team.", "We\u2019ll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the Company by Dr. Sikka followed by comments from Mr. M. D. Ranganath. Subsequently, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Before I pass it on to the management team, I would like to remind you that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward looking statement which must be read in conjunction with the risk the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thank you, Sandeep. Good morning and good afternoon folks. Thanks for joining our earnings call. Let me start by saying that I\u2019m really proud of our Company\u2019s achievement in my first fiscal year as a CEO of Infosys. We started the year just two quarters into our strategy to reimagine services and to transform Infosys. And over the course of this year, we saw that our endeavor which is to bring automation, innovation, education and operational excellence, relying on our human potential that is amplified by technology rather than delivering the same work for less, starting to show concrete results in the organic growth of our client relationships, in our win rates in large deals, and in the types of projects that we\u2019re seeing in strategic areas where we never participated before.", "I am proud of what our teams have achieved this quarter and in the year. And yet despite these heartening results, they\u2019re still based on metrics of the past in many ways, of the way the industry has been. The world of our future looks entirely different. It is a world that is being fundamentally reshaped by digital technologies and it is our endeavor to create great value for every business through solutions built on our AI technology and open cloud platforms to have Infoscions amplified by intelligent technology, to bring purposeful innovation to life to drive collaboration and an entrepreneurial spirit from within to transform our relationship with clients. And in that sense, we are still very much at the beginning of this journey.", "With this in mind, let me turn to the numbers. We ended Q4 of fiscal \u201816 with revenue of INR 16,550 crore or US$2.446 billion and it grew in Q4 for the first time in the last three years. This translates to a quarter on quarter growth of 4.1% in rupee terms, 1.6% in U.S. dollar terms and 1.9% in Q3 constant currency. For the full year, our revenue has grown 13.3% in constant currency and 9.1% in reported terms, ahead of the guidance that\u2019s provided in January of this year. Volumes in Q4 of fiscal \u201816 grew by 2.4%, indicating a healthy momentum in the underlying business and shaping us up well for fiscal \u201817. Utilization including trainees was 74.7% and 80.1% excluding trainees. Blended per capita revenue decreased 1.1% and our operating margin for the quarter was 25.5% compared to 24.9% in the previous quarter. On a full year basis, operating margin was 25% compared to 25.9% for fiscal \u201815. While still within our band of 24% to 26%, we believe the results of our initiatives in automation and tighter control of the operating metrics will help us improve profitability in the coming year.", "We reported earnings per share of INR 15.74 for the quarter, up 3.8% and in U.S. dollar terms earnings per share was $0.23.

Once again in Q4 of fiscal \u201816, we had a record quarter in large deal wins. We signed six large deals with a TCV of $757 million. Additionally, we signed another two large deals in financial services in Americas where based on the present volume of business, we can get another $470 million in revenue. We saw a 45% increase in TCVs of large deal signings in fiscal \u201816 compared to fiscal \u201815 that is $2.79 billion versus $1.927 billion, and this actually excludes other large same contracts that were signed but not included in our reporting.", "Our large deal win rate has gone up significantly for the whole year. Thanks to our focus on better solutioning that leverages automation and innovation in our IT door services, better articulation of value proposition and focusing more on the clients\u2019 point of view the challenges that the clients face, using design thinking as the fame work in how we create our proposals.

And on IAP, our Infosys Automation Platform, more than 125 engagements in IAP have now happened across our segments and 21 additional deployments went out this last quarter across our key accounts.", "In Q4, we released 1,710 full time employees equivalent worth of work across service lines using our automation platform, which brings us to 3,900 FTEs released over the course of FY16 due to automation. These numbers are still small in fiscal \u201816 but will continue to rise as the deployment of items and the tools themselves evolve to handle more complex activities that are today performed manually.", "In addition, we did our first major project to bring the power of automation and information platform capabilities internally to review our own financial processes under Ranga\u2019s leadership. We identified and then massively automated the things that cause latency in our system due to bad processes and we have created a better user experience across our systems. This focus on automation for example, we went from four hours to one hour in revenue accounting, from two days to completely automating project attribute changes from 36 hours to 12 hours for accounting at the project level and many other dramatic simplifications. Congratulations Ranga and your team.", "In the coming quarter, we\u2019ll focus on even more on reconciliation and instant reporting, leveraging our Infosys Information Platform.

We\u2019re starting with managers to drive retention of our highest performing leaders and also to attract the best leaders in the world to Infosys. Over time, my endeavor is to extend this to all Infoscions as we used to do it before. Additionally, we\u2019re providing a 6% to 12% compensation increase offshore; it will be towards the higher end of the range at junior level, and at senior level it will be towards lower end of this range. Of course for higher performers, these numbers will be significantly higher. For onsite similarly, we\u2019re providing 1.5% to 2% average compensation increase and this vary across geographies, based on prevailing market condition.", "In Q4, the Infosys Foundation continued to invest in support programs in the areas of sanitation, health care and rural development. During the quarter, the foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with the Asia Heart Foundation to enable the adoption of robotics in healthcare through a grant of INR 8 crore and provided a INR 5 crore to Sahakara Mitra Sanstha, a center for collective development, to enhance the livelihood of the farming community in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

And now my friend and colleague Ranga will take you through more details of the financials before Q&A.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you, Vishal. Hello everyone. This is Ranga here. Let me first start with Q4 revenue performance. In dollar terms, revenue grew sequentially in Q4 2016 by 1.6% on reported basis and 1.9% in constant currency basis. On a year-over-year basis when compared to Q4 2015, revenues have grown 13.3% in dollar term and 15% in constant currency term.", "Coming to full year performance, our full FY16 reported revenues were $9.5 billion, a growth of 9.1%. In constant currency terms, we grew by 13.3% and at 31st March 2015 rates, growth was 9.3%.", "Coming to volumes, volumes grew by 2.4% during the quarter as compared to 3.1% in Q3 2016. On quarter-on-quarter basis, onsite volume grew by 2.7% and offshore volume grew by 2.3%. On a full year basis, volume growth for FY16 was 14.5% compared to FY15. On a yearly basis, onsite volume grew by 16.8% onsite and offshore volumes grew by 13.6%.", "On Realizations, our realization for the quarter declined by 1.41% on reported basis and 0.9% on constant currency basis compared to Q3 2016. Realization drop for the full year FY16 as compared to full year FY15 was 4.7% on reported basis and 1.1% in constant currency basis.", "Our utilization including trainees increased by 50 basis points to 74.7%; however, excluding trainees, utilization declined by 50 basis points to 80.1%. Onsite mix increased marginally to 29.6%.", "Our operating margin for the quarter was 25.5%, increase of 60 basis points during the quarter. You would recall that operating margin in Q3 was 24.9%. Margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points due to increase in utilization, which I mentioned earlier; 20 basis points due to drop in subcon cost and 60 basis points due to rupee depreciation. This was offset by 40 basis drop in margins due to realization decline. Operating margins for full year FY16 was 25% as against previous year\u2019s 25.9%. Operating cash flow generation was very strong during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $562 million in Q4 as compared to $474 million last quarter. Capital expenditure during the quarter was $115 million. Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31st were $5.202 billion as compared to $4.765 billion last quarter.", "At the group level, we added 9,034 gross employees during the quarter with a net addition of 661 employees. Attrition continues to be on the declining trend. At the group level, annualized attrition was 17.3% as compared to 18.1% last quarter. The quarterly annualized attrition on a standalone basis is declined to 12.6% from 13.4% last quarter. DSO for the quarter was 66 days as compared to 65 days in previous quarter. As you all know, we had a very volatile currency environment in Q4. We managed to navigate the volatility effectively. Rupee depreciated against the dollar by 2.3% on an average basis and 0.2% on period end basis. U.S. dollar appreciated 6% against the GBP. However, against euro and Australian dollar, USD depreciated by 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. Our hedge position as on March 31, 2016 was $910 million.", "Yield on other income was 8% this quarter as compared to 8.6% in Q3, which is -- this drop is a reflection of softening interest rates in India. The expected yield for FY17 is to be approximately 7.5% as compared to 8.6% in FY16, which is a drop of 110 basis points.", "The effective tax rate for the quarter was low at 27.9% on account of write back of tax provisions on closure of audit in certain jurisdictions. Effective tax rate for FY16 was 28% on reported basis. However normalized for provision reversals, the effective tax rate for FY16 was 29.7%. Full year effective tax rate projection for FY17 is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. This is on account of certain software export zone units that will move from 100% exemption to 50% exemption during FY17.", "Our net margin during the quarter was 21.8% and remained unchanged quarter-on-quarter. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.23. EPS grew 1.7% on a sequential basis and 7% on a year-over-year basis.", "Coming to our top account growth, our revenues from top five clients increased by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in reported terms and 1% in constant currency terms. From top 10 clients, revenues declined 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in reported terms and 1.3% in constant currency terms. However, on a full year basis, our revenues from top five clients grew 11.4% in reported and 12.8% in constant currency. Similarly for our top 10 clients, full year year-on-year revenues grew by 8.3% in reported terms and 12.3% in constant currency terms. These numbers are significantly higher than the previous year.", "Coming to segment performance for Q416 amongst vertical, ECS grew 4.6%, RCL grew by 2.4%, manufacturing grew by 1% while financial services and insurance declined 0.3% due to seasonal softness in insurance sector. Overall growth in Q4 was backed by all geographies. Rest of the world grew 4.4%, Europe grew 2.4%, North America grew 0.5% and India grew 9.1%. Growth in India should be seen in the context of smaller base, which is changes due to wrap up and wrap down for certain projects. During the quarter number of $100 million accounts increased to 14 from 13 clients in the previous quarter. Number of $75 million plus clients increased to 31 from 28 clients in the previous quarter.", "We\u2019re guiding for a constant currency growth of 11.5% to 13.5% for FY17. On operating margin, we expect our medium term bank to be between 24%-26%. As in every financial year, in Q1, margins would be impacted by compensation increases and salary increases and visa costs; we expect it to play out this year\u2019s Q1 as well.", "With that, we open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "I wanted to ask if I could on, you highlighted that you\u2019ve taken a number of deals, or won a large number of deals over the really past two, three quarters. I was hoping that you could talk about what part of those deals came from share shifts or take away from you competitors versus deals that might be renewals?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "We don\u2019t include renewals in this number. These are deals that we win net new. And the kind of work that is covered to a large degree comes at the expense of somebody else but in many cases it is also new work that was being done by the clients themselves. This is generally the background. Obviously we win these deals within an intensely competitive environment and that\u2019s why we\u2019re particularly proud of this particular statistic. It also gives us a good base for future. And I think that as I now have mentioned in the press release, there is -- every once in a while we hear this thing about winning because of low prices and this is something that is absolutely not true. When we look back on the deals that we have won, we talk to our clients, we find that every deal that we win is because of superior value that we offer and the great experience, the great articulation of the value and most importantly, a great solution that we bring to the table using our innovation and for no other reason. Pravin, do you want to add something?", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here. I just wanted to correct. We do include renewals here as well. We don\u2019t -- at this stage we don\u2019t have the exact data for how much is the renewal. But even in the case of renewals in majority of the cases, it will come with incremental share at the expense of other competitors as well.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. But if I could just push you a second because it seems like Infosys is certainly doing better over the course of last few quarters, if not the last year. Has your win rate against the competitors, particularly taking business away from your competitors that they previously, I want to say owned, but certainly enjoy the benefits of existing relationships. Would you characterize that your win rate to take business away from competitors has improved over the last few quarters.", "Pravin Rao", "Absolutely, and in FY16, we won 21 large deals total TCV of $2.8 billion and that\u2019s compared to FY15 of $1.9 billion or 45% growth over FY15. And definitely in majority of the cases, we\u2019re definitely taking away business from the competition.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay, just one more from me, if I could, just financial services was -- if I look at sequentially, financial services was a little bit weaker than the rest of your business. How should we think about financial services as we think about the constant currency guidance of 11.5% to 13.5% for this fiscal year; would you think that financial services would be in line with that guidance, better or worse than the overall guidance for the year? And that\u2019s it from me, thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think that financial services had in fact a record year. Mohit can add to my answer. I\u2019ll just give a high level answer, Mohit, and then you can add. We\u2019re actually very bullish on the financial services, even though we continue to see a challenging environment in some banks because of the nature of the offerings and the value proposition that we bring. We did see some slowdown in the insurance area in the last quarter but I\u2019m not concerned about that. I believe there was a short lived and a transient thing in certain plans and so forth. We are actually -- our work is resonating quite well with a bunch of new engagements that we\u2019re involved in and working on. So overall, as I look at the year ahead to borrow a famous line from my friend Mohit, we are cautiously optimistic.", "Mohit Joshi", "Thanks Vishal. So, as Vishal mentioned, look, I think we had a very good year overall. And the sort of weakness that you\u2019re attributing to the particular quarter is partly because of seasonality and partly because of some slowdown in insurance in the quarter, which we believe is typical to this quarter only. Overall, as Vishal mentioned, while there are obviously headwinds in the sector, we continue to be -- we continue to be cautiously optimistic. And the fact is that we have won in Q4 itself fairly significant component of the large deal wins that Vishal alluded to, again from financial services. I believe that our story of Renew, which is built around automation and artificial intelligence, resonates with the need for banks to cut down costs and to industrialize operations. I believe that our story around New which is around design-thinking, around innovation, around digital is resonating with banks as banks need to dramatically transform their operations. Obviously, there continues to be significant spend in the industry around the risk and compliance area, which is an area of strength for us. And there are certain areas in the banking sector which are transforming themselves. If you take the payments portion of the business that is transforming itself and it is an opportunity. On the whole, banks today despite headwinds are spending significant amounts on technology and therefore for a company like us and with the strategy like us, I do believe that there is an opportunity for us.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay, fair enough; many thanks, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ron [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, great. So, I wanted to ask about the operating margin outlook for fiscal \u201817. To achieve your 25% operating margin midpoint of your guidance, I wanted to ask what does this assume in terms of the impact of pricing on your margin. In other words, can you quantify the impact pricing is expected to have on your margin in fiscal \u201817.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Hi, this is Ranga here. Yes, we guided 24% to 26% last year as well and we\u2019re exactly at the midpoint as we close FY16. And in FY16, we had year-on-year full year pricing decline of 1.1% in constant currency. And we do not see any significant, either upward or downward change. At this point in time, we do not see much of a difference in terms of the trend line.", "Second, as you know, in terms of operating levers, there were couple operating levers that started this quarter beginning to show some, especially the subcon expenses as a percentage of revenue, which was 6.3% last quarter, came down to 5.6%, which gave us a benefit of over 20 basis points this quarter. We\u2019ll continue likewise on utilization. If you look at utilization constituently in the last four quarters is about 8%. And we do believe that the, we need to work on that a bit more and see what could be the trajectory of utilization in FY17. Likewise onsite effort mix was 29.6% this quarter and this number used to be around 27% few quarters -- I would say about two years ago. So, these are some of the operating levers, will continue to leverage and optimize in the coming years. In addition, of course we had to see how much of automation benefits would kick in during this particular year. So, to answer your question, yes, last year that was negative 1.1% in constant currency terms. We do not see a significant change in the secular pricing decline.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right, I mean that 1.1% that\u2019s a blended average price but what I\u2019m inquiring about is what you expect the impact of pricing to be on your actual operating margin that you\u2019re going to realize, can you quantify that?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes. Typically for every 1% decline, we do see about 40 basis points.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, got it. And then in order offset, assuming pricing remains somewhat negative, what is your biggest remaining operating margin lever to offset that?", "M. D. Ranganath", "The three principal ones of course is the onsite effort mix is one that I talked about, which is currently 29.6% and we\u2019ve seen in some of the earlier quarters that\u2019s 27%. And every 1% drop gives us about 35 to 40 basis points. Then the utilization, utilization is 80%, just about 80.1%. There again, we have -- in their earlier quarters, we\u2019ve seen as high as 83.7%. So, we need to see how much of that needle we need to move. Likewise, in the onsite role ratio which is another one that we\u2019re focusing on, so -- and to sub-contractor expenses and sub-contractor expenses stayed at about 20 to 25 basis points and right now this quarter, it come down from 6.3% of revenue which was an all time high to about 5.6%. So, these are the three principal levers. Automation benefit, it\u2019s too early to quantify for this financial year but we will see how that plays in.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Mr. Katri, your line is unmated, you may please go ahead with your question.", "Moshe Katri", "Yes, hi. Thank you. Can you quantify the pluses and minuses that actually impacted our benefited margins for the quarter?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Sure. Hi Moshe, Ranga here. If you look at the operating margin for the quarter, the net drop was -- decrease was 60 basis points of which 20% -- 20 basis points due to increasing utilization, 20 basis points due to drop in sub-contractor cost and 60 basis-point due to rupee depreciation and this was offset by 40 basis points drop in margins due to realization decline. So that is the math. ", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. And then looking at your margin assumption for fiscal year 2017, are we factoring any sort of move in FX?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes. At this point in time, it\u2019s very difficult to predict the rupee movement. If you look at of recent months, rupee has started to strengthen at least in the last three weeks. At this point in time, it is difficult for us to predict. I think the key assumption should really be around the price in decline and the volume growth as well as some of the operating levers that I talked about. So, at this point in time, it\u2019s extremely difficult to assume, which way the rupee would move.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay, that\u2019s fare. And then, final question and this is also to Vishal. You\u2019ve done a really good job in terms of expanding or improving your quarterly booking numbers for the past two years, I think you went from $400 million per quarter in 2015 to about $716 million. And then what sort of assumptions do we have for fiscal year 2017? And then can you talk a bit about the quality of the new business that\u2019s coming on board in terms of the blended EBIT margin contribution for the overall business? Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Hey Moshe, the quality of the businesses is actually getting better because when we go into these deals, we bring a lot of the innovation areas into these, IT door services, the software and so forth. As we realize these projects and start to bring them to life, we\u2019re going to deploy more and more of that over the course of the project. There do continue to be many aspects of these projects that are more traditional in nature involving transition of resources and onsite hiring and so forth. So, as much as possible, we\u2019re bringing innovative ideas to these. But I expect to see that the contribution of the innovation to this project will continue to improve, as we go forward. In terms of the visibility, we have a pretty healthy pipeline, as we look ahead. And the pipeline has improved significantly compared to the pipeline that we had one year ago. And perhaps Pravin can comment little bit more that. And therefore, I mean we don\u2019t yet have a forecast on the bookings per quarter over the course of the next four quarters, but when we look at all of the way these projects ramp up and the revenue gets realized over the course of this quarter, all that is factored into the overall guidance. Pravin, do you want to add anything?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, I think in the last, as Vishal said, in FY16, we won net 21 large deals at TCV of $2.79 billion. And this quarter itself, we won six large deals. And in addition, we have won two deals where we believe we will add about another $470 million TCV of revenues over the deal period, which we\u2019re not reflecting the large deals as it\u2019s not fully committed revenue. Overall, in this year, we\u2019re seeing good growth in large deals, good conversion of large deals. So, our pipeline has increased. Our conversion rates have increased. The pipeline is also pretty strong, getting to the coming year. And more importantly, the pipeline is broad-based. We have seen good pipeline across, both Europe and Americas as well as across various industries.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rishi Jhunjhunwala from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Vishal, you talked about eliminating almost 1,700 employees as part of -- or effort equaling to that many number of employees in this quarter. Can you just talk about basically what is the nature of the work in which we actually had these automation benefits, both in terms of service lines and verticals?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Sure. So, we did 1,710 this last quarter, about 1,100 the quarter before and about 600 the year before that and so forth, so more than 3,000 for the -- over the course of the year. The biggest contributor beyond BPO, the biggest contributor is CIS, our infrastructure management service. The nature of the work there is limited for now to fixed price projects, so that the value realized is something that goes into our automation. And in T&M, [ph] it is a disruptive thing, so one of the things that we\u2019re working on is strategic initiative to proactively transform the T&M [ph] projects to fixed price projects, so that the benefits of that can be achieved and also to a certain degree shared with the clients and so that we have a win-win situation.", "Now, when you look at the nature of the work beyond the fixed price, so far, it has been dominated by L1 infrastructure operations as well as some L2 that we have started to see in the last two quarters. So that is something also that we\u2019re working on. We have a very exciting initiative that we\u2019re working on, I am personally working on that around bringing artificial intelligence techniques to the more advanced forms of support the L3 automation areas where we have more than 10,000 developers who work in application maintenance and work on source code maintenance and training system and things of this nature. And by using AI to the simplify some of that work, we believe that we can have a dramatic impact on this. So over time, the idea, I mean if you look at the 1,700, it is not a meaningful part of the P&L yet. 1,700 is a large number and we\u2019re incredibly proud of it and we\u2019ve been tracking this closely. Myself, Ravi, Pravin, Ranga, we all track this very carefully. But in the overall P&L, this is still a kind of a drop in the bucket because it\u2019s a little bit more than 1% of the delivery force. So it kind of gets lost in the big movement around utilization and things of that nature and the number of hiring that we do and so forth. But as this number becomes bigger by making the automation wider in terms of the areas that it comes to and deeper, this number will continue to become more and more significant over the next several quarters. And it will take a big bite out of the -- both the margin as well as the revenue per employee.", "Currently the -- for now, the operational metric that Ranga talked about will have the lion\u2019s share of the effect on margin and RPE. But over time, there is no doubt that this will be far go out by automation as automation becomes more sophisticated.", "And final your question about the distribution, perhaps Pravin you can add to that. CIS obviously was one of the biggest ones, also an application in development and maintenance in VI and package services and especially in verification also we saw significant contribution towards the 1,700. Pravin, do you want to add anything?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, I think this covered pretty much, Vishal. The infrastructure business has been leading the show; in automation, we have fairly good momentum on ADM, the application development and maintenance phase. And testing services historically had a lot of automation baked into the model and now we\u2019ve actually found new ways to add more to it. And we use software, which is our own software which is Panaya to look at automating the enterprise applications.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "And any vertical skew?", "Pravin Rao", "There\u2019s no vertical skew. It\u2019s applicable pretty much in all service lines across the industries. Of course, the ones we have more infrastructure, and more application development have more amenability to it, from a standpoint of automation and from the point of using software to drive automation, which is primarily the Panaya suite of products which we have. That\u2019s more on the enterprise application space.", "Rishi Jhunjhunwala", "Okay. Second is, recently the board and the shareholders approved the compensation structure, Vishal. And it seems like it\u2019s been linked with revenue margin and revenue per employee targets to be achieved every year. Can you share us the targets for FY17?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No, we cannot. This is not a question for the management of the Company, this is more for the board. I mean generally, as has been shared, it is linked to the 2020 -- in that direction of the 2020 target but it\u2019s some kind of a curve that gets up there and I guess that is something for you to ask the board.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead. James Friedman, your line is unmated please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi, sorry about that. When we look forward to the guidance, I was wondering how should we think about the contribution from the top clients since a great portion of your success has been from mining those clients. Is that pattern going to continue as we move into this fiscal?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, I think that. I mean as we look back over the last year, the contribution of large clients to the growth of the Company has been significant. We did about 12.3% constant currency growth in the top 10 clients and similarly the top 25 as well as the top 50 clients grew significantly. Last year, in FY15 for instance, growth in the top 10 clients was only 1.5% or something like that, perhaps Ranga can correct me. So that number has been increasing significantly and we expect to continue to deliver tremendous value to the large clients.", "See, in terms of the depth of knowhow, the depth of the relationship, both in the client account engagement side as well as the delivery side and consulting, quite significant in the bigger clients, there were deeper understanding of their business. I engaged with them as well as Pravin and our management team. So, we expect that the -- we have -- this is an area that we have addressed well and I\u2019m happy with that. I think there is still room for more improvement being more proactive, becoming more strategic to these clients and we expect to continue to do that. But at the same time, we are a Company operating now at a scale where we should be able to walk and do them at the same time. So, this is not to say that there is any dilution in the focus towards new account openings, that is incredibly important and it continues to be, in fact if you look at the percentage of the revenue coming from the new accounts or new projects versus renewals that has improved, which is a good thing, and we want to continue to see it go that way. And we\u2019re also excited about opening certain new market segments, in particular the smaller businesses. And we have been doing great work with the team on the startup engagement and venture investing, and Ravi is also working together with Sandeep on building alliances towards the mid market and we expect to share more about that at our conference event later this month.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. First on financial services, you mentioned winning some deals. I was wondering where in financial services you\u2019re winning those deals and how would you describe large bank budgets overall?", "Mohit Joshi", "I think the deals that we won, one of them is basically to do a suite of -- look at the bank\u2019s entire suite of applications and do well to support across them using our Infosys Automation Platform. We\u2019ve also won a couple of large frame agreements with large global banks. So, I think that is where we see the opportunity. On the capital market side, we are seeing some volatility but overall, the wins have come from across the board.", "Joseph Foresi", "And then my second question is just on pricing. Given that some of the business has matured over the years and there\u2019s some level of commoditization and we\u2019re talking about maybe a little bit of caution around the banks, and this is more of a hypothetical thing, but do you -- how disciplined do you feel like the industry is right now around pricing; and if there was a downturn, could we see you know dramatic price decreases?", "Mohit Joshi", "I think look, as far as the banking deals are concerned, I think banks have realized that there is a limit to how much you can squeeze out on a per unit basis, that in any case that\u2019s not something that they\u2019re looking at. So, all of the deals that we have had very significant components of software in them. So, you got people plus software that allows you to give that leverage whether it\u2019s automation or it\u2019s artificial intelligence as the use of frameworks and tools, that is what is allowing us to give those long term cost advantages to our clients, rather than just pointing at rate reduction because that could not accomplish what the banks are looking for or not others but own purpose.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Hey Joseph, let me add to Mohit\u2019s great observation. The banks are -- actually many of the large banks in certain geographies are under such savior pressure from a regulatory perspective, from an economic perspective that simply doing the same thing that they have been doing cheaper is no longer enough. A vendor in order to succeed in this climate has to bring capabilities and technologies and innovation that not only others are not able to but the banks themselves are not able to. So, you have to be able to do things in new ways that were not there before. So, if you look at the large deal that as Mohit mentioned, the automation in this case of maintenance, this was a maintenance IT operation support project that we won, one of the large deals out of the 757, this would not be possible by simply doing the same management and maintenance cheaper but you need to bring the capabilities of artificial intelligence to be able to bring in dramatic automation based economic improvement as well as the quality improvement in the process with the visibility, with the regulatory reporting aspect and so forth.", "So, in order to be able to successful -- in order for a vendor to be successful in this climate with the bank, we have to have innovation in the story; we have to have a deep understanding of what is going on in the clients and that is what it takes. And it turns out that if you have those, then the fact that the banks are under tremendous pressure doesn\u2019t matter; in fact that is a good thing and it allows us to win more business. So, the deals that Mohit mentioned, the two same deals that we did not include in the 757 are also both in the financial services industry.", "Mohit Joshi", "And I just want to add one final point, which is that, if you take a U.S. specific prospective, then obviously there has been core dime banks have been working with us for many, many years but we serve a larger market. If I look at Europe or if I look at Australia for instance or I look at parts of the Asia Pacific, there are still several areas where banks are still struggling the technology where they are still investing sort of fairly early to make sure that there are good applications that their entire environment is up to spec. And that also gives us significant opportunity. So, while there is the industrialization piece which is focused on cost reduction which is focused in efficiency, which is focused on not to mention on platforms, there is also the entire piece [ph] around the renewal of the banking landscape around making a new sort of digital footprint for banks around the opportunities that the new digital technologies allow us.", "So, while there is a focus on cost reduction in certain parts of the industry, especially within the capital markets space, there is a huge growth opportunity in parts of retail, corporate banking and the asset management business, which are now getting increasingly impacted by technology and therefore need to invest to make the change.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. And then justly from me, we talked about automation and you gave some headcount numbers, which were obviously on the smaller side. How do you see that playing out over the next couple of years? Do we hit an inflection point where those numbers become meaningful in a shorter or a long period of time and what\u2019s their impact on margin? I know you\u2019ve given color in the past, so I just wanted to get an update on how you see it playing out?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think in order for this number to start impacting the margin, it will still take some more time. If you look at the utilization that Ranga mentioned 80% -- 80% to 83% is what a few thousand people. So, it has the same impact for now as it does in the world of automation. But on the other hand, if we\u2019re able to get automation to a much larger percentage of our employee population, the nature of the work that the employees do that is the one third of the employees or our 40%, 50% of the employees work activities can be more and more automated. Then, we\u2019ll see a dramatically larger impact of automation to the bottom line than to any of the operational - the traditional operational measures.", "It is somehow like you can feed the horses better and you can whip the horses and get better horses and so forth. But at some point, you need an automobile. And that is sort of -- it\u2019s a horrible analogy probably but this is what comes to my mind. The other part of it that we quickly realize is that as we bring more intelligence to the operational processes, actually the cost simplification from automation becomes dwarf by the value improvement because of automation. More straight true processing, more integrated process, better improvement of the experience trying to understand the point of a business process and improving, then that becomes much more about innovation and then creating much larger value and so forth. So that has its own unexpected and significantly larger benefit. So, all of this -- I\u2019m really excited about all of this playing out. I mean one thing that gets lost in the middle of all these large deals is that a lot of that has been happening because of the automation and so forth as well. So, it is in my view a very fundamental part of the future of our industry and certainly the future of our Company. And there is only one way forward and that is full speed ahead.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line Arvind Ramnani from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. ", "Arvind Ramnani", "Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes Arvind, go ahead. ", "Arvind Ramnani", "The question is for Vishal. It\u2019s been almost two years since you\u2019ve joined Infosys, can you provide us color on the nature of your conversations you\u2019ve had with your clients? Specifically when you\u2019ve started, you spoke to probably a number of your current and prospective clients, they were going you feedback on their perception of Infosys. And I am sure you\u2019re continuing conversations now. So, can you elaborate how the perception of Infosys changed amongst clients and possibly like some of the underlying reasons for this change in perception?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "First of all, when I think of two years, does it really mean that long, it feels like yesterday. I think frankly, my answer to this would be somewhat not objective and perhaps even self servicing. So, it is little bit awkward for me to answer that especially because I see a distinction, conversions have improved dramatically, the relationships have become much more elevated and more importantly the nature of the work that we do has had become more elevated. There are kind of strategic projects that we\u2019re starting to do now with clients; it\u2019s just extraordinary. We work on their digital future and we work on bringing AI to their most complex problems. We recently had a huge company from Europe that was going through a very structural change, and they actually did their entire rebranding exercise in our office in Palo Alto. There were -- the entire leadership team of this huge company was locked in our office and working on deep extensive questions about their future and their identity and it was just unbelievable experience.", "We recently had the entire management team of a massive industrial company visiting our office and they were shocked to find a small team, one of the design teams that we have growing little plant inside the office. And they were like what is the story with these plants, and actually these were plants that they were growing for an agricultural company, one from these clients in an heavily instrumental atmosphere of where the entire plant the soil that it was in and all of that had tons of sensors in plant and these people like people from these giant industrial company were absolutely shocked to see that.", "So, I mean those are the two random examples that came to my mind at the end of F14, our long day. But the nature of the relationship, the nature of engagement, we\u2019re designing actually a workspace if you can believe; we\u2019re designing an entire building of our one of the large companies in the United States because they saw our space; they were very impressed by our ability to build green and highly open collaborative workspaces and so forth. So, there has been an absolutely marked changed in the nature of the relationships with the clients, certainly not with all of them but evident increasing number of these -- I would say these are actions, the ones that we\u2019ve been able to touch with our strategic method at the strategic levels. And I certainly expect to and that I wish to see this is our certainly our goal and our aspiration to see more and more of that.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Congratulations and just a quick follow-up; in terms of comparative you\u2019re seeing have also changed and have the number of kind of deals that are kind of you get pre-approved for fiscal [Indiscernible] has that also changed?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I have no idea. Is your question that are we wining more deals at the expense of competitors or are they also changing their story which one -- what was it?", "Arvind Ramnani", "Are you basically entering situations there, the kind of -- your clients basically kind of pre-selective, do not even open up some of the projects -- to competitors, are you winning projects where you are really like get selected versus going through like entire RSV process?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "This -- I don\u2019t have the statistics on this. But informally, I would say that the sole source of the non-RSV deals number has at least from where I see, and this is certainly a fraction of the client base. This number to me seems to have increased dramatically.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question. I would now like to handover the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for his closing comments. Over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. We\u2019ll look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys that concludes this conference call.

And over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks Serena. Hello, everyone and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q1 FY17 earnings release. I am Sandeep from the Investor Relations team. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath along with other members of the senior management team.", "We\u2019ll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the Company by Dr. Sikka and Mr. Ranganath. Subsequently, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Please note that anything that we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement which must be read in conjunction with the risk the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thank you, Sandeep. Good afternoon, good evening and good morning everyone. And thanks for joining us today, as we report the results of Q1 fiscal \u201817. To characterize the quarter, we had some unexpected headwinds that resulted in lower than expected revenue growth in Q1. And at the same time, we continued to make strong strides in the execution of our strategy.", "We started this year on the moment from the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201816, which was one of the best fourth quarters that we had in recent years. We ended the first quarter of fiscal \u201817 with revenue of $2.501 billion or Indian rupees 16,782 crores. This represents a growth of 2.2% in U.S. dollar reported terms, 1.4% in INR reported terms and 1.7% in quarter-on-quarter constant currency. Volumes grew by 2.2%. Operating margin from the quarter was 24.1%, largely impacted due to typical employee and visa related costs of the first quarter, but also supported by improvement in utilization and reduced spending in subcontractor services among other measures that we took.", "The softness in top-line growth was primarily on account of unanticipated headwinds in discretionary spending in consulting services and impacted implementations as well as slower project ramp-ups in some large deals that we had won in the earlier quarters. This resulted in lower revenue from some client engagements, especially in our life sciences, energy and utilities portfolios. The revenue for our India and Finacle units declined slightly as well. All of it impacted our revenue for the quarter. On the positive side, telecom reported 11.4% sequential growth, manufacturing at 4.4%, retail and CPG reported 5.5% growth, and transportation and logistics reported 9.3% sequential growth, all well-above the Company\u2019s average for the quarter.", "As a result of our focused efforts on expanding strategic client relationships, our top 10 clients grew by 3.9% on quarter-on-quarter and top 25 clients grew by 4.4% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms. The number of clients in the $100 million revenue bracket increased from 14 to 17. We have more work to do in growing the next tier of clients, and this will be a focus area for us going forward. We also added 95 new clients for the quarter.", "Our headcount stands at 197,050 as of June 30th of 2016. While attrition was higher at 15.8%, the more important metric for us is high performer attrition, which improved by more than 200 basis points. Revenue per employee showed a slight uptick from the previous quarter and was $50,897 for the quarter. Of course, we want this to be on a much higher trajectory, going forward; and this is where automation and innovation will continue to play a key role.", "Despite the challenges this quarter, we made many positive strides in the execution of our strategy of Renew and New, built on a culture of education and learning. This is evident in the growth of our renewed traditional services, large deal wins, top account growth, the gathering momentum of our new services, the early stages of monetizing key initiatives such as Zero Distance, the number of FTEs that we have saved due to automation, the increased level of employee engagement, the overall changing perception of Infosys from a supplier to strategic partner, and more.", "Revenue per employee is moving in the right direction, and various operational efficiencies are starting to yield results. We won $809 million of TCV in large deals during the quarter, not including a large same agreement that we did with the financial services firm. These large deals give us better medium term predictability; the initial revenue from these maybe small as projects ramp up. Most importantly, these engagements give us access to a broader canvas of client operations where we can apply our software in automation, in reduction of complexity, bringing together fragmented knowledge of data or understanding dependencies across systems. This remains an important metric for us.", "Let me now talk about some of these in a little bit more detail. In renewing our core services, our traditional services of application development and maintenance, infrastructure and cloud services, product engineering services, and software testing grew above the Company average, aided by automation and innovation. Our Zero Distance program to bring innovation to every project now covers more than 95% of all our projects; and we are seeing this program move beyond ideas and start to monetize. I believe this initiative has enabled us to change the perception of Infosys on the ground with our clients from supplier to a strategic partner, as one of our key clients recently described to me; a partner that is striving to be a company of innovators. Our reutilization improved 40 basis points to 80.5% and subcontractor spending reduced to 5.4% of revenue from the highs of earlier quarters. Leveraging our automation solutions, we saved approximately 2,150 people worth of effort across service lines, primarily in application maintenance, package system maintenance, BPO, and infrastructure management. We are pushing the pedal on our cost optimization program, and Ranga will provide more color on this in his remarks.", "Zero Bench, our initiative to engage employees that are between projects on value creating assignments, has now covered nearly the entire bench with more than 20,000 jobs created in almost one year since it was launched. We are now taking this beyond our traditional delivery organization also to include consulting and BPO. In the new areas, I am very excited about the launch of Infosys Mana at the end of April, as it brings to life something I have been working on for a very long time, bringing purposeful AI to the enterprise to continuously renovate enterprise business processes. Mana is a knowledge-based AI platform capturing the fragmented knowledge in people and in long-lived systems, and bringing this together with data and machine learning to drive automation. We are very encouraged by the interest shown from clients across industries with the steadily increasing pipeline of opportunities, and our first Mana wins and first success is already with Johnson Controls, Syngenta, and others.", "Infosys information platform continues to gain traction with more than 227 engagements to-date. Many of them strategic in nature including our work with an electronic payments client on transforming their core processing platform and enabling them to take advantage of innovation in Internet of Things, AI, machine learning, big data and more. And we are already seeing customers benefitting from our investments in next generation technologies such as Waterline and Trifacta. We have already integrated IIP with Waterline and have customers such as Harley-Davidson and Synovus using it. Going forward, we are bringing IIP into the Mana portfolio branded as Mana for Data. I believe this will enable us to tell a much holistic and yet simpler story around the sophisticated things that Mana can do for our clients.", "Skava, our digital cloud platform had a great quarter. We continue to see strong applicability in many industries of Skava, including financial services and insurance and of course, in retail. Nectar India, which launched in India earlier this week is built on the Skava platform. Nectar India started out as a Zero Distance idea that later led to a Design Thinking engagement with Aimia to explore the ideas in more detail and this Zero Distance idea has now launched to more than 1 billion people.", "Our EdgeVerve business continued its strong momentum with 16 wins and 21 go-lives for both the Finacle and the Edge suite of solutions across markets. In bringing Design Thinking to our clients, we made significant progress over the last quarter to proactively drive new business transformation programs for our clients. We are working with the Hershey Company on key transformational initiatives, including the SAP implementation, their sales and digital initiatives as well as their overall strategy to becoming an insights-driven company. We have many such examples, and this to me is a fully exciting area where we continue to see significant potential.", "On investments in ecosystem, in first quarter, we expanded our relationship with Microsoft in product development and legacy modernization. We announced a strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services to help clients transition from mainframe and legacy systems to a modern cloud-based platform and partner with KUKA on Industry 4.0. We also announced an investment in Trifacta, which develops software for data management and data wrangling.", "Through our culture of learning and education, we have now trained nearly a 100,000 people in Design Thinking in our effort to empower every Infoscion to be an innovator and to help our clients find the most important problems to solve together with them. We continue to revamp our curriculum, introducing new ways of learning, leveraging our Infosys learning platform and other tools. Employee engagement continues to be high. We\u2019re bringing new ways of doing talent management and bringing that to bear and retaining and empowering and growing high-performing employees. This week, we are... [Technical Difficulty].", "Thank you so much. Sorry about that. I believe I lost the call where I was speaking about this week. This week, we are rolling out the first phase of our equity program, enabling our employees to share in the successes and in the ownership of our performance. And beyond our business and ourselves, we continue to bring a great passion and care to the communities around us. In India, the Infosys Foundation among various programs provided several grants this quarter towards education and healthcare. Some of these grants include to the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune, and Bangalore Life Sciences Cluster.", "In the U.S., the Infosys Foundation USA continued its mission of providing equal access to computer science and maker education to underrepresented communities. We have analyzed the Maker Movement; the Foundation launched the \"WhyIMake social campaign at the June Nation of Makers event at the White House as well as announced the winners of the spring cycle of the Infy Maker Awards. At CrossRoads 2016, the Foundation\u2019s annual thought leadership conference, the Foundation announced its CS for All Community Giving program in partnership with the National Science Foundation and DonorsChoose.org.", "In closing, as I said earlier, we had some unexpected headwinds that resulted in lower than expected revenue growth in Q1. At the same time, our long-term vision is stronger than ever and more relevant than ever, as we see the promising signs of significant value that is possible with a software-led transformation of the services industry in these early successes that we have seen. And because of this, I take a balanced view of the quarter.", "On Brexit, there are challenges for a company such as Infosys in this uncertainty and yet there is a great opportunity for technology and services in the areas such as integration, interoperability, and transparency that in events such as Brexit here. Technology has a key role to play in this to work across the wall gardens to be a unifier to a time of disruption. It is still too early for our clients or for us to specifically determine the impact of Brexit other than possibly the cautiousness that comes with the short-term uncertainty.", "Clients are obviously cautious in embarking on new programs at this time, especially in financial services. Given the weaker than expected Q1, our current visibility for Q2 and a somewhat broader uncertainty and caution in macro environment, we are lowering our full year fiscal \u201817 growth estimate to 10.5% to 12% in constant currency. We had guided in April that our revenue growth in fiscal \u201817 would be in the range of 11.5% to 13.5% in FY16 constant currency terms. As always, depending on our performance and the outlook at the end of Q2, we will provide you an update during the earnings report in October of 2016.", "Let me now hand it over to Ranga for his comments before we take your questions. Thank you.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you, Vishal. Hello everyone. This is Ranga here. Let me first start with Q1 revenue performance. Our revenues in Q1 were $2,501 million, which is a growth of 2.2% in reported basis and 1.7% in constant currency basis. On a year-on-year basis, when compared to Q1 of \u201816, revenues have grown 10.9% in dollar terms and 12.1% in constant currency terms. Volumes grew 2.2% during the quarter as compared to 2.4% in Q4 of \u201816. On quarter-to-quarter basis, onsite volume grew 3.3% and offshore volume grew 1.8%.", "Realization for the quarter declined by 0.3% on reported basis and 0.7% in constant currency basis as compared to previous quarter. However, on a year-on-year basis, realization declined 0.2% in constant currency basis and 1.3% in reported basis.", "As Vishal mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on optimizing our operating efficiency levers. These levers are utilization, subcontractors, cost as a synergy of revenue, onsite mix percent and onsite employee cost as a percentage of revenue. Some of these indicators have improved during this quarter. Let me talk about their trajectory during this quarter.", "Let me first talk about utilization. Our utilization excluding trainees, increased by 40 basis points to 80.5%; similarly, utilization including trainees also went up to 76.5%. For the last five quarters, utilization excluding trainees has been consistently above 80%; and we will continue to focus further improvement. And we do believe that there is scope for improvement.", "On subcontracting expenses, as a percentage of revenues, it improved further. You will recall that it was at the higher level of 6.3% of revenue in Q3 of last year; it reduced to 5.6% in Q4; and during this quarter, it has further reduced to 5.4%. While some of the subcontractor cost is inevitable to address the business needs, we are further strengthening our talent planning to optimize the need for subcontractors.", "Our onsite mix increased to 29.9% during the quarter and we need to focus on bringing this down in a gradual manner, and we\u2019re working on it. Onsite employee cost as a percentage of revenue is at 39.3%, primarily in account of compensation increase during the quarter. As you know, in Q1, we announced annual compensation increase and we also have visa costs. On a comparable basis to Q1 FY16, employee cost -- onsite employee costs as a percentage of revenue is flat at 39.2%.", "Typically in Q1, margins are impacted on account of visa costs and compensation hike. Our operating margin for the quarter was 24.1%, decrease of 140 basis points during the quarter as compared to previous quarter\u2019s 25.5%. Margins for the quarter decreased as compared to previous quarter, 140 basis points due to wage hike and additional 80 basis points on account of visa costs. However, we were able to offset 80 basis points increase due to cost optimization, measures that we took during the quarter as planned and reduction of variable pay.", "Our emphasis on healthy operating cash flow generation continued this quarter. Operating cash flow generation was strong, and we generated $452 million of operating cash in Q1, compared to $345 million last year same quarter. Operating cash flow was up 31% as compared to Q1 of last year. Our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30th were $4.918 billion as compared to $5.202 billion last quarter. The decline in cash balance during the quarter was finally due to dividend payment of $481 million. Our collections were healthy and DSO for the quarter was 66 days as compared to 68 days in Q1 of last year.", "Coming to employee metrics, at the group level, we added 13,268 gross employees during the quarter with the net addition of 3,006 employees. Our quarterly annualized attrition on a standalone basis has increased to 15.8% from 12.6% last quarter. At the group level, annualized attrition, and I say grew, it includes BPO, because at 21.0% as against 17.3% last quarter.", "As you know, Q1 saw huge volatility in currency, especially in the backdrop of Brexit. We managed to navigate the volatility effectively. On a period-to-period basis, USD appreciated 6.6% against GBP, 2.1% against euro and 3.1% Australian dollar. Our hedge position as of June 30th was 976 million. We expect some near-term volatility in cross currency and rupee, and we continue to manage the same through appropriate hedges. Yield on cash balances was 7.8% in Q1 2017 as compared to 8% in Q4 \u201816, which is a reflection of softening interest rates in India. We expect yield for FY17 to be approximately 7.5% as compared to 8.6% in FY16.", "Coming to taxes, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%. We expect full year effective tax rate for FY17 around 29%. Our net margins during the quarter were at 20.4% as compared to 21.1% in Q1 \u201817. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.22 compared to $0.21 in Q1 \u201816; so, EPS grew 7.4% on a year-on-year and was down 4.1% on a sequential basis.", "Coming to clients and business segments, during the quarter number of $100 million plus clients increased for the first time after several quarters to 17 from 14 clients in previous quarter. Active clients, now stands at 1,126 as compared to 1,092 previous quarter.", "Coming to segments performance for Q1 \u201817, amongst verticals, financial services and insurance grew by 2.2%; manufacturing 2.9%, RCL 1%, and the ECS grew by 3.1%. In geographical terms, North America grew 2.5%, Europe by 0.6%, rest of the world by 6.9% and India declined by 7.6% during the quarter on a smaller base.", "Coming to margins, we have always said that in the medium-term, our margin expectation is in the range of 24% to 26%. If you look at this quarter, we had operating margin of 24.1%, almost at the same level of Q1 of last year. During the quarter, we were able to offset to some extent the effect of compensation increase and visa cost through cost optimization measures through several levers that I mentioned earlier during this call. As I mentioned earlier, some of these cost efficiency levers are improving, and we will continue to further optimize these levers, and we do have opportunity. Therefore, we continue to expect our medium-term margin range to be 24% to 26%.", "With that, we\u2019ll open the floor for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thanks very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer Session. [Operator Instructions] We have first question from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Hi, good evening. Could you talk a little bit about the insurance vertical? We\u2019ve been hearing some sort of more cautious commentary across the industry in recent quarters, presumably now that they are more challenged with extended period of low interest rates, any thoughts there?", "Manish Tandon", "Hi, this is Manish. I run the insurance sector. The spend in the sector is challenged overall. I think what was happening is that with the negative bond yields et cetera, the treasury there -- treasury is not producing enough returns, and there is overall cut that we see. With that said, we have had a couple of very good wins in the last quarter, in the insurance space. And we remain bullish about the sector, at least for us.", "Edward Caso", "My other question is I just wanted to press a little bit on clarity on the margin guidance on what medium or intermediate term means. So, help us out here, on your press call earlier today, you suggested in the short-run, the margins more in the 24% to 25% range. Now, is short-term this year or shorter than that? And given the seasonality of your business with your margins, just trying to -- help us clarify that. Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Sure, thanks for asking the question. We continue to retreat that FY \u201817 operated margin will be in the range of 24% to 26%; there is absolutely no change in that range.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have next question from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi, I\u2019d like to start with following up from Ed\u2019s question. As you think about the trajectory of margins over the course of the year, you called out a few things, for instance visa costs; I understand wage hike\u2019s impact this quarter. But, how do you anticipate visa costs continuing to be a headwind and more specifically or more broadly I should say, why the margins go back up; what are the forces that are going to get relived that causes margins to go back up?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Sure. Every -- the margins dropping in Q1 of every financial year is seasonal. As you know, we announce our compensation hikes every year in Q1. Typically, the margin impact on account of compensation hike is around 1.5%, and this quarter we had 1.4%. As you know, Q1 is also the time when we file for our H1 visas in the U.S. And every Q1 of every year we have this cost and this year we had 0.8%, in fact on account of that. So, over Q4, decline of margin by 150 basis points to Q1 of the year is very normal. It happens in every year. That is nothing unusual about it. And having said that, during the quarter, if you look at last year for example, we were at 24%; and this year we are at 24.1% on Q1-on-Q1. And so, typically the margin dips in first quarter because of these two reasons; and afterwards, it gets normalized during the course of the quarter. And, so, that is one trajectory while we reiterate that 24 to 26.", "The second part is coming to the levers. As you know, as I mentioned three quarters earlier, there were couple of cost efficiency levers which we thought we had not fully optimized. First, we identified the subcontractor expenses as a percentage of revenue. It used to be 6.3% in Q3 of last year. We said, we will bring it down. And it came down to 5.6% of revenue in Q4; and further, it came to 5.3%. While some of the subcontractor expenses is required to meet some of the business needs in short term, at the same time we do believe that some of that is also because of lack of better talent planning and some inefficiencies in that area. So, that\u2019s what we are focusing on; we want to eradicate those inefficiencies.", "Coming to likewise in utilization, utilization for example for the last couple of quarters has been consistently above 80%. And we do believe that there is scope for couple of points improvement because in some of the quarters, we have now in the range of 82, 83. So, that\u2019s second trajectory. Likewise onsite employee costs. So, these are the levers that we believe we have at our disposal and we want to optimize them.", "Keith Bachman", "My follow-up question then would -- I wanted to talk more broadly about financial services. You talked a little bit about the insurance side, and there\u2019s some pressure there. But I wanted to hear some comments that you\u2019d be willing to share with us surrounding the broader financial services, in particular the investment banking broker-dealer areas. And I know in your previous comments, you had said that it\u2019s a little early to think about the UK situation. How are you thinking about -- you think about scenario, the UK situation, what that might do to the investment banking or broker-dealer world in particular and how that may either help or hurt in terms of the broader financial sector spending in IT over the next couple quarters?", "M. D. Ranganath", "So, I think in the financial services, we had a good quarter. If you strip out the results of Finacle, we grew at about 2.5%. And, you\u2019re right, in the broker-dealer segment, we did see some headwinds. So, that was lower than we expected. But, I think it\u2019s a -- I think it might -- we\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019ll comeback in the second half of the year. Overall, the story that we have, right, the software plus services story, I think that\u2019s really resonating well with our clients. And the whole industry is in the middle of a transformation. So, there\u2019s a huge amount of interest in technology, what it can do from the perspective of industrialization and reducing cost to income ratios and from the perspective of what digital transformation can do for the industry. We also see that the pressure on regulatory mandates and the compliance pressure still continues especially in Europe with PSD2 [ph] and MiFID II. So, we think that the spend in the industry should stay stable. And from our perspective, we see a strong pipeline for Q2.", "Even in Q1, if you read through our commentary, of the 10 large deal wins that we had that is deals over $50 million, three of these deals were in the financial services business, and this included consolidation deals but it also included deals where we led or where we are leading a payment transformation initiative for a bank in Australia. So, overall, I think we had a good quarter with stable to strong volume growth.", "On the Brexit question, I think this is something where like the rest of the industry and like actually the financial services business, we are in a wait and watch mode. There has been a lot of concern and there has been a lot of volatility. But, with the exception of one example, we have not really seen slowdowns or change in client behaviors. I think it could be a positive for us as clients look to restructure their businesses or as they look to move workforces to Continental Europe. They will also be -- spend on account of new regulatory and compliance mandates, which would mean system changes. But on the other hand, it would also mean a slowdown in decision making and a cut in spending. So, we are waiting to see the impact of that.", "Finally, just to echo what Manish said, more than Brexit, we are concerned about the interest rate scenarios, so the fact that interest rate hikes are unlikely or are going to be slower in the second half of the year. So, we are waiting to see what impact that has on spend.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Yes. So, a question about your European business. If Brexit only really affected decision making at one client, which is what I think was said on the earlier conference call. I would like to understand what explains relative growth weakness in your European geography. I\u2019d specifically like to know, if Europe\u2019s growth would have been weak in the quarter even in absence of Brexit?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, Rod, this was unrelated to Brexit. The one example, I think Mohit gave earlier, in the earlier call was pertaining to slight slowdown that we saw, which was not actually significant related to Brexit. However, the slowdown in Europe that we saw is related to the two things that we talked about earlier, the slowdown in the discretionary spending relating to consulting services and package system implementations, as well as one of the large deals that we had won couple of quarters ago that we had expected to ramp up at a faster rate than it did over the course of the quarter. Both examples were in Europe. So that is the reason that we saw the slowdown in Europe. It was not related to Brexit.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Understood. So on that note, let\u2019s talk for a second about the consulting and package implementation business. Quarter-to-quarter, swings in a given segment can definitely be misleading I know, because of lumpiness of deals. But in that consulting market, you generally aren\u2019t seeing a lot of lumpiness; you\u2019ve got a lot of project based yields there. It was interesting yesterday to hear TCS essentially report much improved consulting growth. But, I think you\u2019re today citing consulting as a key reason for your revenue weakness and you had a sequential decline in that business. So, in that context, can you characterize the latest demand trend in the overall consulting in system integration market? I\u2019d like to know to what extent the recent weakness in your business there was due to the market, or was it more due to specific challenges on Infosys specific deals, or maybe you encountered some execution setbacks in that business? In other words, can you dimension the market impact in the consulting business versus the Infosys specific impact in your consulting segment in its latest growth rate?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, I think that it is almost entirely us; it is our situation with clients and our execution. I would say, almost all of it or vast majority of it has nothing to do with the opportunities or consulting in the broader market, it is all us and this is something that we\u2019re going to take a very strong -- or put a very strong focus on. Rajesh is now running our consulting business. And I do believe that, there is actually a need in the tier above our traditional services to offer the next generation, strategic services and program management and high-end capabilities around complex program, whether these are around package systems or not. And I think that that is something that we continue to be very excited about.", "On the very top end around strategy and design oriented engagements, as I mentioned in my commentary earlier, we actually have seen significant amount of success. But, roughly 3,000-person consulting organization that we have that we have integrated over the course of the last year or between the old Lodestone Company and the Infosys management consulting team, that just ran into some challenges that were unanticipated over the course of the previous quarter. And those are all largely due to our own execution. And this is something that we are going to put a very strong focus on, and fix.", "Rod Bourgeois", "And how long does it realistically take to improve your position in that consulting business? I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a multi-quarter effort; it\u2019s not something that turns overnight. Right?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, I don\u2019t think, it will turn overnight. But, I mean, now that we have a strong focus on it, I expect that -- I am confident that it\u2019s going to do better. But, you are right, assuming a dramatic turnaround here is going to take couple or three quarters, but this is something that -- I mean there is no shortage of opportunity there. So, I see no reason why we can\u2019t get it straight.", "Rod Bourgeois", "And September is your seasonally strongest quarter. Do you see some improvement in that consulting business occurring in your September quarter?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Generally, September quarter is a good one in consulting. In our case, because of European holiday schedule and so forth, it has some impacts. But, we have factored all of that into the numbers that we have guided on.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have next question from the line of Moshe Katri from Williams Trading. [Ph] Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. Vishal, I think it will be helpful if you provide some more color on some of that spending power that you mentioned that you\u2019ve seen in the consulting universe. And then, should we assume that -- just to clarify, should we assume that this actually continues for the second half of this calendar year, based on what you\u2019re seeing out there?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Hey, Moshe. First of all, congratulations, man. Generally speaking, I don\u2019t read too much into that. It\u2019s just that -- I mean if you look at the guidance and the underlying situation, we have -- the basic pillars of our strategy are both working extremely well. The renewal of our core business and the main delivery engine has worked very well. We delivered -- what, 3.4%, Ranga, growth in the first quarter under Ravi\u2019s leadership. And this was clearly something that where the combination of Zero Distance like initiatives on grassroots innovation, there is a bringing Design Thinking in a massive way and also the power of automation has all clicked in. And then even more encouragingly in parallel to that, the new areas around Mana, Skava and Edge did extremely well. Where we had the challenges were in these small pockets, in particular in consulting and package implementations as well as in India and Finacle. And Finacle was at $2.5 million decline. So, I don\u2019t read much into that at all because we had a very good quarter before that.", "So that is basically what has dragged down the performance in the quarter. And being the first quarter of the year and being the sequential quarter-on-quarter nature of the business, we are having to revise the guidance downwards by a point. So, that is basically what has gone wrong. [Ph] And the reason for that in the consulting world as I mentioned is an answer to the previous question was it\u2019s primarily our own execution in some projects that ended that we did not anticipate not being renewed and exits in some cases and so forth. So, that is something that we are determined to fix. And I am not reading too much into the spending pattern and so forth, as a broad thing in that context.", "As I mentioned with regard to Brexit and so forth, this is still too early to tell whether that has an impact in these areas or not but the impact that I have talked about so far is not related to any of them.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then, just a follow-up; are you resetting your hiring plans for the fiscal year because of what you\u2019ve seen so far?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No. We are hiring and hiring very -- yes, we are hiring in all ways. We are -- actually, as I have said, our longer-term, the 2020 ambitions are around $80,000 revenue per employee, which means that the rate at which we hire will tend to decrease. And nonetheless, it is still even at 20 billion and $80,000 revenue per employee that is 250,000 employees, which is a little bit more than 50,000 employees more than where we are at now. So, this won\u2019t slow down dramatically, it will slow down to some degree because of the benefits of automation and productivity improvements kicking in. So, that is kind of what we are doing.", "Also on attrition, I mean, yes, the attrition number went up to 15.6 or something thereabouts. But, if you look at the high performance attrition, we\u2019ve put in a very specific talent management approach on earlier this quarter. And as a result of that we were able to decrease the high performance attrition by 2 percentage points from 13.2 in the previous quarter to 11.2.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead. ", "Bryan Bergin", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. On BPO, I think I heard some slowness mentioned earlier. Can you talk about what verticals or service lines that maybe driving that?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Radha, do you want to answer that; industries and verticals and service lines?", "Anantha Radhakrishnan", "Yes, sure. In BPO, we are adapting the Renew and New strategy, the renewal of the existing BPOs through automation and providing higher productivity, using people and software to create greater value for our customers. The new part of the BPO is what is very exciting. We are trying to reshape client experience or stakeholder experience of our clients. We are using Bala in ways very unique to try and create more value for our clients. And clearly, the operating model has to move from the headcount based fee models to percentage or value based outcome models. That is a journey which we are undertaking; it\u2019s very exciting.", "Bryan Bergin", "Okay, thanks. And then just on your M&A pipeline, can you just remind us again your core areas or I guess areas of focus?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "For BPO or for the Infosys Group as a whole?", "Bryan Bergin", "Broadly.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "On the M&A, priority continues to about bringing, hiring and innovation, hiring -- about hiring. It\u2019s -- at the end of the reporting, [ph] our long day guys. It is around buying next generation companies that help us accelerate our ambitions with new technologies, next generation -- if you look at Skava, it\u2019s a great example of the kind of acquisition that wish to do, or Panaya, the companies that we\u2019ve bought. So, we will be -- we are selectively looking for opportunities in new and emerging areas where differentiated technology solutions, AI based solutions, collaboration and design solutions can help us advance our mission. And that continues to be the case.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Rudra", "Hi, thanks. Just on the performance for this quarter, Vishal, it\u2019s probably been the second or the third quarter we\u2019ve seen significant volatility on one side or the other, compared to where we were expecting. And, last time this happened, I think you\u2019d indicated that you were taking in some steps in terms of getting internal early warning systems and improving execution. Maybe, if you can elaborate what steps you\u2019ve been taking to prevent internal surprises, and especially in terms of planning?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "The last several quarters, we\u2019ve been consistent in how we have -- and consistently positive in how the changes have happened. This particular time, some of the surprises hit us relatively late, the combination of the consulting that I mentioned and the slower ramp ups on the projects and so forth. Ultimately, there are bunch of things around simplifying our processes and building internal systems to be much more responsive in real time. But to a certain degree, there is an inherent volatility in our business where ramp downs are immediate and ramp ups take a while. And so that asymmetry creates a challenge in being able to forecast more accurately. And now, we are adding these new dimensions of the software business which have their own dimension of volatility.", "So, a combination of all these things has got to this point. And the solution is very simple to do for us to ensure that we do for us what they do for clients already, which is to build much more fine-grained real time systems that can give us a more granular sense of where we are.", "Ankur Rudra", "Would a wider guidance range help, given the greater volatility now?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No, Ranga is saying we have reduced the guidance and yes, that is true. I think that if we were to increase the guidance range that would help stay within the band but it would kind of miss the point as well at the same time. So, I don\u2019t know; I think the better solution to this is to lower the volatility, to have smaller gaps and so forth. And that is more a -- and part of it is the fact that we are transforming a business in a quite a fundamental way. And so, no matter how sophisticated our systems are, there will continue to be surprises that we get hit by. But, your point is absolutely something that Pravin and I have been working on, which is to -- ultimately to simplify our processes. So, Ranga and his team already have put in place earlier this quarter, a brand new process that we call OTR which is similar to our order to cash process. And we will continue to make process improvements and bring ourselves and do real time, just as we do for our clients.", "Ankur Rudra", "Fair enough. And just one more question on the revised guidance, I realize that you\u2019ve baked in the impact you\u2019ve seen in the quarter, but I am not entirely sure I understood whether you\u2019ve baked in potential further caution beyond what you saw in this quarter. So, have you been overly cautious in terms of potential impact of weaker macro environment and Brexit beyond the loss of revenues this quarter?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No, no; this is a visibility that we have as of today. This is -- we have not baked in the impact of Brexit, because we don\u2019t know what the impact of Brexit is and where this thing is going to go. Our philosophy in the two years that I have been here as well as in times before has always been to give our market a very accurate sense of what we see. It is not about the business of what is it called, under promise and over deliver and managing expectations and stuff like that. It is simply -- to give you, Ranga put it very nicely earlier that we want to always minimize the asymmetry of information between us and what management sees and what the market sees, and that is our always our endeavor and our commitment to you. And this guidance is basically what we see at the present time. And if this changes, we will of course let you know.", "Ankur Rudra", "Fair enough. Just last question, maybe Ranga you can help me. You mentioned subcontracting cost is something you\u2019ve worked on very closely in the past and maybe that will be a lever for the rest of the year as well. If you can help me understand, typically what\u2019s the transformation of reduction in subcontracting cost? Because I am assuming when you reduce subcontracted labor, there is an adjustment in terms of rise in full time employee cost, maybe an impact on utilization as well. So, net of that typically, how much is let\u2019s say 100 basis-point decline in subcontracting actually transmit into margins?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a good question. One is looking at the subcontracted cost as a percentage of revenue. And that has to be seen along with whether the total employee cost as a percentage of revenue is also showing the similar trend line. For example, if it declined the subcontractor expenses by 1%, if the total employee cost goes up by 1% as a percentage of revenue, absolutely no impact on P&L. However, if you look at this quarter and if you look at the three quarters, both have moved in tandem. For example, in subcontractor expenses as a percentage of revenue, three quarters ago in Q3 was 6.3% and let\u2019s said this quarter, it is 5.3%. Now, if you look at the onsite employee cost as a percentage of revenue compared to the last years, it is flat; it is 39.3% and it was 39.2%.", "Now, coming back to your second part of the question, which is, how does it play out? Yes, there are two types of subcontractor reductions that we are looking at. One, is that subcontractor required it all in that position; can we replace with another employee is one. In that case, differential savings would really be what we pay to the subcontractor and what we pay to the employee. Typically, subcontractors are hired of niche skill sets. And we have seen even up to 30% to 35% of cost differential between employee salary cost and that subcontractor expenses. That is one.", "The second category is we do look at certain opportunities. Hey, we do really lose subcontractors beyond a certain period and can they really reduce a total number of headcount in that project, if it is a fixed priced project for example. So, it\u2019s a combination of these three factors. But, we took a decision that look, we need to really optimize. While we all agree that subcontractors are required for meeting certain business needs, we look at internal inefficiency if any in talent planning and timely availability of our own talent pool requirement, so we are able to reduce that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I was wondering, just starting first with attrition, what part was voluntary versus non-voluntary; and do you expect that to directionally improve; and was any of that related to the project delays in the quarter?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "There was almost -- the usual contribution of non-voluntary -- so, there was -- Krish, do you want to answer this?", "Krishnamurthy Shankar", "So, the voluntary attrition is about 1%, and that\u2019s been the average over the last couple of quarters. So, it\u2019s not kind of spiked up.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then, obviously directionally, you expect it to improve and none of the attrition was related to the projects themselves that were delayed, right?", "Krishnamurthy Shankar", "Yes. Normally this quarter, because this is a time many of these people go out and do higher education and all. So attrition always goes up in this quarter, but we hope to see it coming down. We\u2019ve already seen it come down in June. So, I think in the next quarter, we think it will come down.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And I\u2019ll try this question; I\u2019ve tried it before a little bit. But, you\u2019ve done a very good job on the operational innovations. But, from a transformational standpoint, I am wondering, can you give us any color on the progress you are making on the digital front? I know a lot of players have given percentages of revenues and you\u2019ve said a number of times that hey, all of what we do is digital. But, maybe you could either give us some examples or help us understand how you are competing in that particular arena?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "First of all, that term has been quite deeply abused in the industry. And I know, I have joked about it in the past, but over the course of this last quarter, I looked into some of these digital projects in more detail. And in turns out that a lot of things that are traditional ADM and so forth are characterized as digital. Having said that, there are two very fundamental, very deeply two ways in which there is a digital revolution going on around us. And you have to go back to Nicholas Negroponte\u2019s book on Being Digital to get inspiration from that. The first one is areas where end-customer touch points where businesses are digitizing the previously physical end-user touch point. And the second area, now, this applies to retail, but also to consumer facing aspects of any business. The second area is where the Internet of Things where the digital technology overlaying on to the physical world whether in machinery or in the buildings or institutions, machines and so forth creates new digital opportunities and experiences, as a counterpart to the physical world. So, if you look at digital as these two, our digital practice that Ravi has, as well as our Skava business that we have run, applies very much to the first part of it. And our engineering services work and our Mana platform applies to the second part of it.", "I don\u2019t see any particular value in breaking up this revenue and putting it into some category and then compete with somebody who calls their Salesforce.com implementation as digital and so on. But, I can tell you about the things that we consider digital. And all the work that we do in bringing Skava as a new mobile or kiosk environment or virtual reality or chat environment bringing a new interface to engage with clients that is all digital, as well as the work that we do in creating new digital experiences, new ways of understanding product engagement and consumer behavior, those are in our digital practice, which has been growing quite significantly under the leadership of the new leader that Ravi has hired.", "And then, on the Internet of Things physical world side, I mean if you look at the work that we have done with Mana, the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 work, and we also did a partnership with KUKA by the way over the course of this quarter and working on Industry 4.0.", "Our engineering services grew significantly in the last quarter, one of our fastest growing practices. And that is again to a large degree based on overlaying the digital world onto the mechanized world and whether it is in turbines or engines or airplanes or chillers or machines like that. I think that I mean if we see enough need from all of you to characterize this particular revenue, then I\u2019d be happy to separate that out and call that out. But, I am unwilling to call a mobile front-end on a 10-year old website as a digital revenue.", "Joseph Foresi", "That\u2019s very helpful, thanks. And then, just one last question from me on the pricing front; I know pricing has always been competitive. And, I am asking sort of a very hypothetical question here. But, if should we see a downtick or some sort of disruption due to Brexit, is that your chief concern that pricing could get hit fairly hard because the business and the majority of the business is more commoditized, at this point or should we be concerned more about discretionary spending? I am just trying to get a sense of sort of if you are prepared to go into this or if there was a downtick, which I know you are not seeing yet, where you would start to see it and how severe you think you might be able to get? I know that\u2019s very hypothetical.", "M. D. Ranganath", "On the pricing front in the last few years on the business and IT operation side, it has always being under pressure. And it\u2019s not from a rate card perspective but more from a deal perspective where clients -- whenever a deal comes for renewal, clients are clearly expecting 30% to 40% reduction in what they\u2019ve spent, so that they can repurpose the spend on the discretionary side. So, whatever pressure we have on pricing, we are trying to counter through operational metrics as well through automation -- operational levers as well as through automation, and that is already factored in. But, on the Brexit, which is again hypothetical, but if it\u2019s Brexit expense, then, I think the impact will be mostly on the discussion discretionary side. And there either I go the projects may, I mean because of the uncertainties, some of the projects in short-term may get pushed out or there may be pricing pressure on the discretionary side of things. But again, at this stage, it\u2019s hypothetical. We have to see how it will evolve.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today.

A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov ", "I'd now like to pass it on to Dr. Vishal Sikka.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thanks Sandeep. Hi everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. We had good overall performance in Q2. You will recall that during our Analyst Day in Pune in India, in August, we had outlined certain expectations on Q2 performance. We had mentioned then that we would focus strongly on execution in Q2 and expected revenue growth in Q2 to be better than Q1.", "We had also mentioned that we would focus on certain drag factor for Q1 like consulting Finacle, BPO, and our India business. I'm happy to report that as a result of our strong focus on execution in Q2, our sequential revenue growth was 3.5% in reported terms and 3.9% in constant currency terms.", "This compares to Q1 in which we had 2.2% growth in reported terms and 1.7% growth in constant currency growth. Consulting India and Finacle have all performed better in Q2 compared to Q1.", "We will continue to monitor performance of consulting closely in the coming quarters as it still faces headwinds. Our core IT services had robust growth of 4.7% in constant currency in Q2. Volume growth was 4%. We continue to see adoption of our new services by our clients and are focusing on building a healthy pipeline of our new services.", "I am particularly excited about the interest from clients and our knowledge-based AI platform, Infosys Mana, both in helping them renew their core businesses and especially in helping them to explore and define new areas. I will talk more about this in a little bit.", "Coming to strategy execution, we have been sharing with you certain key indicators that we track. During the quarter, we had large deal wins of $1.209 billion. This includes new deals wins of $138 million and framework deals of $1.071 billion.", "In terms of client metrics, our top 10 clients grew year-on-year 3.7%, our top 25 clients grew 4.3%, while non-top 25 clients grew 10.6% on reported terms. The number of $50 million clients increased by two to 54, while the number of $100 plus clients increased by one to 18.", "We continued our strong focus on improvement in operational efficiency parameters, such as utilization, on-site offshore makes subcon expenses and cost optimization. Ranga will provide more details on these in his remarks.", "Our operating margins improved 80 basis points from 24.1% in Q1 to 24.9% in Q2. Amongst large verticals, growth was led by financial services and insurance, which grew 5.2% on constant currency and energy, utilities, and communication and services which grew 7.3% on constant currency.", "We had robust all-around growth across all geographies. We added 12,717 employees on a gross basis and 2,779 on net basis. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 200,000, at 199,829. Attrition from the quarter declined to 15.7% for Infosys Limited standalone and 20% for the entire group with high performer attrition, a particular focus for us continuing to decline.", "We will continue to seek opportunities in M&A and investments and in this quarter, we invested in Cloudyn, a cloud-spend optimization start-up in Israel.", "In Pune, we had also announced that in order to further enhance client focus and our agility in the market, we would create smaller industry segments in sales. We have completed this exercise and the new structure is effective as of today.", "Similarly, we reorganized our delivery organization in April 2015; where-in we consolidated and defragmented our various services under Ravi's leadership. We have seen significant benefits out of the delivery organization as seen in stronger service line focus and improved operational efficiencies and stronger ownership by the leaders.", "We see a similar opportunity in sales through these smaller more agile more focused and more accountable industry segment under the leadership of Mohit, Sandeep, and Rajesh.", "Coming to the business outlook for FY 2017, you will recall that in Pune, we said that we will be in a better position to provide the business outlook after delivering Q2 and assessing the business environment for Q3 and Q4. We had indicated then that we see more headwinds than when we entered Q2. During the course of Q2, we have signs of cautious client behavior; our announcement on RBS ramp down is an example of this.", "Over the last couple of weeks, several of our peers have also indicated a software business environment leading to a more cautious outlook for FY 2017. After considering our H1 performance and the near-term business outlook based on the visibility and our assessment, at this point in time, we expect our revenue for FY 2017 to be between 8% to 9% in constant currency terms.", "Now, let me share a few thoughts on the execution of our Renew and New strategy through automation and innovation and how we are fueling this through a culture of education and learning. In Renew in Q2, we made good progress on our strategy to renew of our core services and help our clients renew their core businesses through automation and grassroots innovation.", "We're accelerating this by monetizing Zero Distance, bringing our knowledge-based AI platform Mana to all aspects of our service offerings including leveraging Mana internally and continuing to drive value from the bench. Our traditional services of application development, infrastructure management, and product engineering all grew above the company average.", "Zero Distance, which is our program to bring innovation to every project, is enabling us to deepen our existing band relationships, show differentiation to help us with new opportunities, and provide tangible examples of Infosys as a strategic partner for grassroots ongoing innovation.", "Zero Distance continues to cover more than 95% of all projects and is truly a grassroots innovation movement across Infosys. We are now elevating this further to drive greater value for our clients and converting these ideas into solutions. Hundreds of Zero Distance ideas are being implemented in planned projects, with many of these converted into new business opportunities generating commercial value for Infosys.", "Regarding Mana, I'm really excited to see the growing interest from clients and in the industry and we're in the processing of building a strong pipeline. While we're in early stages with revenue impact insignificant for the quarter, we saw continued adoption and clients successes.", "Internally, we're levering our own automation solutions to drive greater efficiencies into all of our service lines. In Q2, Ravi estimate that we save 2,387 FTEs worth of effort across service lines, primarily in application maintenance, package system maintenance, BPO, and infrastructure management.", "Going forward, we will go beyond automation and apply the knowledge-based AI capabilities of Mana to complex scenarios with a focus on increasing productivity. Zero Bench, which is our program to engage employees and value creation while they are between projects, has created more than 26,000 work packets with many of these being generated by Zero Distance ideas.", "And nearly 12,000 work packets have already being completed by folks on the bench. This has ensured that almost all of our bench capacity is engaged, and we're already seeing benefits in terms of additional revenue, as well as margin improvement through the solutions created.", "As a result of gaining valuable experience on these Zero Bench assignments, more than 1,000 additional freshers run directly to client projects in the first half of fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2017's first half. And you also see this contribute to the improved utilization.", "We continue to grow coming to new areas in our new services and products in Q2 and help our clients drive breakthrough innovation. In particular we are working with a number of clients and partners on levering new technologies, especially AI technologies including machine learning, to drive large scale transformation. Our AI platform Mana is key to this and we will accelerate our work in new areas in Mana.", "We also announced in September our new incubation as a service and dedicated Infosys' team that will be the innovation engine for our clients leveraging our learning experiences across industries and our work in emerging technologies.", "We will run this model with co-creation and collaboration with clients at the heart of what we offer, founded on the principals of Design Thinking. Skava continue to help clients create new kinds of customer engagement across channels, and in Q2, we launched Skava Commerce, a new standard for modern, mobile-first modular e-commerce platform. For example, Infosys and TOMS Shoes are working together to implement an omni-channel platform leveraging Skava Commerce.", "EdgeVerve delivered a strong performance this quarter with 48 wins and 23 go-lives from both the Finacle and Edge suite of solutions across various markets. Edge products added several new clients this quarter across various solutions with EdgeVerve is leading with eight new wins.", "In Design Thinking, we continue to bring Design Thinking into every client engagement. For example, we're working with Kohl's, the large U.S. retailer to leverage Design Thinking together with our Skava platform on how to enhance customers, sales associates and the overall Kohl's experience.", "Coming to culture, we continue to invest in our employees and in learning and education. In education this quarter, we added a focus on collaboration to every class that we offer in our University in Mysore. This is based on learnings from our data sciences class in which we saw the code quality was significantly improved through collaboration.", "Specifically, we reduced the number of code issues at 35% for individuals, down to 12% in a group of 10. We're also introducing new kinds of programs including Udacity Nano degrees and Coursera for rapid upscaling when needed for the most in demand niche skills.", "And for employees, we continue to rollout the equity program with the first phase to mid and junior level high performers already complete. We will be extending this to the leadership levels as we look at programs to retain our best leaders and attract new leaders to our company.", "Looking beyond business, at Infosys, we're deeply aware of our role in society, which reaches beyond business. In India, through the Infosys Foundation, we made several investments in the areas of rehabilitation, healthcare, education, and arts and culture, including handing over a residential enclave of 200 houses to families that were rendered homeless in the aftermath of cyclone Hudhud in 2014, launching an Institute of Robotic Surgery to support Narayana Health and funding travel stipend for top researchers at IIT, Kharagpur as well as sponsoring an IIT, Kharagpur study about the antiquity of the Indus Valley.", "The Infosys Foundation USA supports quality computer science and Maker professional development for teachers via the computer science professional development week, the CS for all community giving program and the commitment recently announced at the White House Summit on Computer Science for All.", "Additionally, the Foundation announced new grants to support the larger CS teacher organization, the Computer Science Teachers Association recognize excellence in CS teaching through awards and to support the New York Academy of Science. We continue to be very proud of our work in our communities.", "In closing I would like to hand it over to Ranga to provide more details on the financials before coming back for Q&A. Thank you.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you, Vishal, hello everyone. Let me start by saying that in Q2, we focused further on improving the operational efficiency of our business and we continued our emphasis on healthy cash generation.", "I'm happy to report that we have seen an improvement on both these fronts during the quarter. Our revenues in Q2 were $2,587 million; there is a growth of 3.5% on reported basis and 3.9% on constant current basis.", "On a year-on-year basis when compared to Q2 of fiscal 2016, revenues have grown 8.2% in dollar terms and 8.9% in constant currency terms. H1 2017 revenue growth as compared to H1 2016 was 9.5% in reported terms and 10.5% in constant currency terms.", "Volumes grew by 4% during the quarter as compared to 2.2% in Q1 2016. On quarter-on-quarter basis, the on-site volume grew by 3.1% and offshore volume grew 4.4%.", "Realization for the quarter increased by 0.2% on reported basis and 0.7% on constant currency basis compared to Q1 of FY 2017. On a year-on-year basis, realization declined by 3.6% on reported basis and 3.8% on constant currency basis as compared to Q1 of 2016.", "Operational efficiencies parameters, several of them improved during the quarter. Our utilization excluding trainees increased by 2% to 82.5%. Similarly, utilization including trainees went up to 77.7%.", "Over the last six quarters, utilization excluding trainees has been consistently above 80%. On-site mix reduced to 29.7% during the quarter and we are focusing on bringing this down gradually, which there could be quarter-on-quarter volatility.", "Subcon expenses again were at 5.4% of revenues in Q2 similar to Q1 2017 level, but lower than 5.5% in Q2 of 2016. Employee benefit cost, as a percent of revenue was 55.7% as compared to 55.3% in Q1 2017, primarily in arc of compensation increase and higher variable pay that we paid to our employees this quarter, offset by better utilization. On a comparable basis to Q2 FY 2016, employee benefit costs as percentage of revenues were 54.7%.", "On the collections were healthy and DSO for the quarter was healthy at 64 days as compared to 66 days in Q1 2017, a reduction of two days.", "Our operating margins for the quarter was 24.9%, increase of 80 basis points over Q1 2017. Improvement in utilization and on-site mix contributed to 100 basis points to margin improvement. This was partially offset by increase in third-party software costs, which negatively impacted margins by 60 basis points.", "The benefit of on-site cost optimization initiatives and lower visa charges and -- which was slightly offset by impact of higher variable pay and compensation increases, resulting in net positive impact of 40 basis points. So, overall, it led to 80 basis points expansion in margin.", "Our emphasis on the healthy operating cash flow generation continued this quarter. Operating cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, partly helped by tax refunds of about $50 million.", "We generated operating cash flow of $563 million in Q2 as compared to $481 million last year same quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30th was $5,349 million as compared to $4,918 last quarter.", "We added 12,717 gross employees during the quarter, with a net addition of 2,779 employees. The quarterly annualized attrition on a standalone basis has also decreased marginally to 15.7% from 15.8% last quarter. At a group level, annualized attrition was 20% as compared 21% last quarter.", "As you know, Q2 saw currency volatility, especially in the backdrop of Brexit. We managed to navigate the volatility effectively. On a period-end basis, USD appreciated by 3.6% against British pound and depreciated by 0.3% against euro and 2.2% against Australian dollar.", "Our hedge position as of September 30th, 2016 was $1,037 million. We expect near-term volatility in cross-currency and rupee and we continue to manage the same through appropriate hedges.", "Yield on cash balances was 7.77% in Q2 2017 compared to 7.82% in Q1 2017. We expect the yield for FY 2017 to be approximately 7.5% compared to 8.6% in fiscal 2016 due to an interest rate environment in India. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.8%. Full year effective tax rate projection is expected to be around 29% for fiscal 2017.", "Our net margins during the quarter were 20.8% as compared to 20.5% in Q1, an expansion of 30 basis points. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.24. EPS grew 3.8% on year-on-basis and 5.5% on a sequential basis.", "Coming to clients and business segments, our number of $100 million clients continue to increase this quarter. It increased 18 from 17 last quarter. Likewise, $50 million clients increased to two to 54 clients. Active clients now stands at 1,136 as compared to 1,126 last quarter.", "Coming to margin expectations, we will continue to optimize the operational efficiency levers on an ongoing basis. We have said in the mediate term, our operating margin expectation is the range of 24% to 26%. Considering the expectations on growth trajectory for the second half of the year and as revenue growth is one of the key determinants of margins, we expect fiscal 2017 margins to be in the range of 24% to 25%.", "With that we will open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "We have first question from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi, I was wondering could you just talk about the change in the outlook, is that more economic or structural? I know this came up with one of your competitors; I want to get your view on it. Maybe you could describe why?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "It is largely based on couple of client-specific headwinds as well as the -- some of the couple of service lines like consulting and BPO that we expect the growth to be lower than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.", "I would not say it is structural. The structural change has is happening in our industry is wide known -- I've been talking about this for the last two years and that has to do with this -- a very pervasive and fundamental downwards spiral that the industry as it has been is going through, which is based on the pricing pressure, the rapid acceleration of the rate cut, the decline in pricing realization and so forth, which is being fueled by a variety of reasons and so forth. But that is structural thing. But otherwise, this quarterly fluctuation that we see has nothing to do with the structural thing.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then my second question is -- I appreciate the color on the margins for this year, just given some of the structural things you just talked about, what do you expect from a margin or profitability standpoint over the long-term? I know that you've given some color about perhaps some innovation helping the margins, but I was wondering what you thought about the margin profile over the long-term?", "M. D. Ranganath", "I think let's -- let me first take that question. Yes, in the medium really, as we rightly said, we continue to reiterate 24 to 26. And as you know the margin is a derivative of three principal components, one is of course, the revenue growth itself, the second one is the pricing decline, and the third one is to what to extend the pricing decline could be offset through operational efficiency, and the last one, of course, is the automation piece.", "As we can see in this particular fiscal as we have said several times, our primary focus this fiscal has been on how do we look at all our operational efficiency levers, which could be levers for margin improvement in the short-term to medium term. But in the long-term, the real levers that we have is really automation.", "If you look at for example, we need to look at the two pieces of the spectrum that we have for improving the operating margin and near-term to medium term spectrum is really the operational efficiency and so and also for the projects how do we throw productivity improvements, it could really improve margins given in the ongoing projects.", "But in the longer term, it's really the automation. Let me first address the first part. As we have seeing toward the last four quarters, we have continued our sharp focus and the lever that we have on operational efficiency whether it is utilization, -- it used to be in late 1970s as recent terms of five or six quarters ago and consistently with the last six quarters, kept it above 80%. This quarter it's further improved by 2.5%. Likewise subcontractor expense used to be 6.3% and we brought it down to 5.6%, then 5.4%, and likewise the on-site employee cost as a percent of revenue and so on.", "We do believe that the trajectory of this operational efficiency indicators over the last three, four quarters have been moving in the direction and we too believe there are some more levers.", "But as you said this is for the short-term to medium term. For the longer term, automation is one which can give us the more sustainable margin improvement and Vishal has been focusing in the company with the last couple of quarters has been focusing. Even there, if you look automation, the first phase of automation typically focuses on offshore, at the lower end of the pyramid kind of jobs. You will not really see significant impact on P&L if it is only offshore and the lower end of the pyramid for meaningful impact on operating margins through automation, we need to really see across the pyramids both on-site and offshore reduction in the effort into automation.", "So, that's where the current focus is. I think Vishal wants to add some more color [ph].", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Absolutely. Thanks Ranga. The -- longer term when you look at the margin situation, there are two keys things that are going to have instructed. And in fact Ranga already talked about automation, the key there is to ensure that the productivity improvement that we can achieve through our Mana platform outperform the downward trend in the pricing.", "If we are able to do that, we will improve the margin, if we are not, then margin will continue to be -- to decline, to be under pressure. It's as simple as that and I think it obviously points to a very clear-- [Technical Difficulty]", "Joseph Foresi", "Hello?", "Operator", "This is the conference operator. Sir, we can't hear you?", "Joseph Foresi", "Can you hear me now? Hello?", "Operator", "Sandeep Mahindroo, can you hear me? Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a disconnection from the management's line. We request you to please stay connected while we have the management reconnected. Thank you.", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have the management reconnected. Over to you sir.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, Joe, this is Vishal again, just to answer your question again, longer term when comes to margin, the one key thing as Ranga talked about is automation. And there we have to ensure that the improvement in productivity because of automation -- because of our AI platform Mana, outpace the downward pressure -- the downward curve of the pricing pressure that we see.", "If we are able to outpace that, we will improve our profitability, if we're not, we will not. And this is something that is I believe the most fundamental issue that is facing the industry and I believe on this measure, we're continuing to make good progress because of expanding the sophistication of our AI platform and so on.", "The other aspect of longer term aspect of margin is to ensure that our new services and our software-based offerings continue to gain scale and continue to gain traction, because these are high value, high margin kinds of offerings and the more of those that we can embrace and that includes in some cases opening up new go-to-market channels and so forth, the better off we will be on the margins.", "Our margin thesis is based on these three observations that Ranga talked about. One is that the industry is under the structural decline margin pressure which impacts our core business. Number two, automation and AI can help us dramatically improve our productivity and if we're able to outpace the performance as a result of outpace the downward pricing pressure as a result of that then points the better.", "And number three, our ability to offer new services that are high value and high margin that can help us improve margins over the long-term. Thanks.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then just on pricing, have you seen any change in pricing and could pricing become a bigger problem if the demand environment stays depressed obviously for the extended period of time? Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, we have. In fact, we mentioned that in our press release, the decline -- the downward pricing pressure has continue to intensify over the course of the last two years. Perhaps, Ranga, you can provide the numbers of how the pricing decline has happened over the course of the year?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes. I think in our opinion, the real -- rather the relevant indicator would be really the year-on-year for a longer period because they could be quarter-to-quarter volatility in pricing which may not sometimes, could not be the ideal indicator.", "So, for example, last year, if you look at entire FY 2016 over FY 2015, the pricing decline at cost currency was close 1.5%. Now, likewise if you look at on a half year versus this year, H1 2017 over H1 2016 in constant currency basis, you have seen a pricing decline of 1.6%.", "So, we're seeing in this range of 1.5% to 1.6% even this quarter, so that is something that we have seen in the first half of this year.", "Joseph Foresi", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have next question from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi, thank you. I had two if I could. The first one is growth dynamics for the industry. If you thought about the combination of a leading Indian-based IT service providers such as WIT, yourselves, TCS, and Cognizant, what do you think the growth rate would be for the industry as reflected by those participants in calendar year 2017?", "You guys are guiding to call it 8% to 9% year-over-year growth, TCS; if you take constant currency was closer to 7% recently. Is that the right range you think for calendar year 2017 for the industry?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Hey, Keith. This is Vishal. I have absolutely no idea. I can only tell you that -- I mean of course, we can tell you what we see in our situations and everyone will have their own situations and guidance based on that.", "We have shared our outlook. What I can say broadly is that the entire industry is under the structural change that is going on. The downward pricing pressure -- I have been talking about this from the last two plus years, and it has only become more intensified, more accelerated, more steep and I think we're all seeing the results of that playout in various ways across the industry.", "And it's going to be a very difficult transformation for the entire industry. It is -- if you look at our performance in Q2, of course, we did extremely well in our core services. And that core services improvement is a direct reflection of the fact that we\u2019re able to bring in automation, which is still in the early stages, but we're also bringing a culture of innovation. And I think that dual transformation is going to be absolutely essentially for the IT services companies to be able to be relevant in the times ahead.", "We have to improve our productivity through the power of automation and AI and we have to in parallel be able to take that freed-up capacity because of AI and deploy that towards innovation and creativity. If we don't do this, then we're going to be a victim of this downward pricing pressure. It is as simple as that.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Well, my follow-up actually relates to that, thank you. In terms of the pricing pressure, when we listen to the other providers, the leading providers, the comments from our pricing pressure is fairly consistent. You're suggesting that pricing pressure is actually increasing, is A; There are reason you think in different perspectives?", "And B, is the pricing pressure mostly and what we would characterize as a legacy areas of ADM and outsourcing and BPO, is that where the pricing pressures areas are shown up or is it even in the new areas that we would simply characterized as digital areas?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, exactly. I mean no, what I mean by that is not in terms of the amount of pressure on any of that. I think we can do the analysis on that and we can all see what that has been like and perhaps it is improving -- I mean increasing, perhaps it is not. But it is certainly becoming much more pervasive and rate cuts and so forth are becoming much more frequent that's what I see.", "And exactly as you said the new service areas around digital experiences, adoption of AI and AI solutions and clients, these are the areas where there is a high value opportunities, which we have to go after and build the capabilities and the skill for.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. All right. Thanks very much for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Hey thanks. I wanted to get some color look at your TCV for the quarter that was very significant. I think it was worth of $1.2 billion. I think last quarter you were north of about $800 million, maybe talk a bit about the -- if you're looking at some of the deal flow that's coming through, which part is renewals, maybe we can get some sort of an average which part is new logos. And then you also mentioned framework agreement, maybe you can kind of explain what that actually entails? Thank you.", "Pravin Rao", "Hi, we have one fixed deal worth about $1.2 billion plus, two of the deals are traditional committed deals and four are framework deal. By framework we mean, there is a very clear expectation in consulting formal agreement from the customer that, there is a kind of revenue we will make or the deal duration. But there is no contractual commitment, so that why we have [Indiscernible] doubt.", "And in terms of the deal, we have -- out of the six deals, two deals have been from new logos and four of the deals have been from existing clients, but this varies from quarter-to-quarter, for instance, that we reported $880 million plus last quarter, if that we had 10 deals and there also the split between new and existing would vary. So, it varies from quarter-to-quarter, so we can't conclude on a quarterly basis.", "Moshe Katri", "What sort of -- which part of the $1.2 billion in terms of percentage was renewed this quarter-- last quarter?", "Pravin Rao", "We actually don't report the renewal versus net new, because sometimes it\u2019s the mix -- in some of the existing accounts as well, part of it could be renewable because even when we renew, we will get the incremental revenue, it becomes bit complicated.", "So, we typically don't --we always say what is new logo and what is existing customers, but we typically don't get into how much is the renewal and how much is--.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes, just to add to what Pravin said here. Look as Pravin mentioned at times we may have what we qualify as framework contracts, so for instance, for a large financial company, we signed [Indiscernible] closed to $0.5 billion, but basically this is revenue, we have been doing multiple projects with them and this is a commitment from their side to keep -- add $0.5 billion over the next five years. So, while this is not really renew, because [Technical Difficulty] existing projects that have extended, this is the expectation of [Technical Difficulty] over the next five years.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. Understood. And then as a follow-up looking at the discussion about margins that we had. In the past we spoke about cushion of about 500 to 700 bps that can actually help us sustain the EBIT margin range that we kind of focused on, utilization is at around 82.5%, I mean the real question here is, how comfortable are we that question is still there? And how badly do we need automation to come through to help us kind of sustain that EBIT margin range that we've focused on in the past? Thank you.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes, hi Ranga here. I think there are -- the multiple levers that we talked about earlier, right, for example, if you look at $82.5 billion that's the overall number including on-site and offshore while on-site is higher, offshore is still lower, below 80. So, we have some levers there, but of course, we need to really -- it could be quarter-to-quarter volatility as I said earlier, but that is something that we're focusing on and on-site makes it something and we have seen on-site mix in the range of 27% as recent as about one and a half to two years ago.", "Every 1% decline in on-site mix can give 50 basis point straight away in operating margin. But of course currently there's [Indiscernible] marginally came down from 29.9%. So that is a much more gradual one, but of course 27% is something that we have done recently, 27%, 26%. So, that's the trajectory that we will be watching very closely.", "Likewise, if you look at our on-site employee cost and subcon expenses for example maybe 6.3% at the high and it has come down almost 1% in the last three quarters and we do expect that though the contract expenses are required to meet the short-term demands where we don't have talent at the same time, we do believe that there are markers which that can be addressed through better talent supply chain planning and more importantly, looking at the margin of core subcontractors, which we did this quarter for example.", "Likewise, we have the on-site employee cost structured on-site pyramid, on-site pyramid is something which we are focusing. The pyramid has to reflect the concomitant and billing rate for the pyramid that is there. So, we're seeing especially on the fixed price projects on-site, I think how we could in a fixed price project in a particular project is there, how do we make sure that we have the optimal on-site pyramid? Can somebody seen near there mid-level and we really stand redeployed in other new projects essentially giving that much additional flexibility on-site because once the person is out of the fixed price project on the cost side while it will come down on the revenue side, there is no impact, can they be deployed elsewhere on-site new project.", "And also we are looking at for the higher end of the pyramid whether the current within reach [Indiscernible], should they be now move to different projects. So, there are many other element that they have been doing over the last couple of quarter because our on-site employee cost as a percentage of revenue you would noticed it on a comparable basis.", "If you look at some of our offshore players is on the higher side. So, we are looking at it in a way that won't hurt growth, but at the same time, gives us flexibility to work on it. So, in some substance over the last three, four quarters, this has been our focus and at least the trajectory of these indicators had been helping us in the last four quarter. We continue to do so in the short to medium term.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "And then on the capability issue that you raised. The crucial aspect of this is to ensure in order to say ahead of pricing downward curve, is to ensure that the AI platform is able to do -- bring automation-led productivity improvements, to even the more complex kinds of work that people perform, not just the L1 and L2 support task which are easier to mechanize and easier to automate, but to the more complex and more imagination requiring tasks, the more cognitive tasks, such as application maintenance, L3 maintenance or even application development and product engineering and those kinds of things, and certainly, of course, more complex forms end-to-end testing and things like that. And that is on our endeavor is to continue to develop those capabilities in Mana that build those kinds of complex automation capabilities in.", "Moshe Katri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have next question from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. It's Jamie from Susquehanna. I was wondering in terms of your forward guidance, are there any verticals that are contemplated to decelerate or accelerate? If you give us some color, and which and realizing on guide on vertical base, but if you can give us at least some color, about what you're contemplating in the second half on a vertical basis that would be helpful.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, maybe our three President of Sales are here, perhaps they can comment on those.", "Sandeep Dadlani", "Hi, this is Sandeep. I can give color on high-tech, manufacturing, retail, CPG, logistics. I think if you look at retail, CPG and logistics they are broadly trending together. They are volatile, we had a great Q1, we had a flattish Q2, but if you look at the incremental revenue and market share capture, it's perhaps higher than most industry peers, as retail go through disruptive times.", "Q3 for these industries is usually weak because of the holiday season and most of these companies are focused internally towards getting the holiday season right. But as consumer spending picks up, at least the early signs are that we will have a good holiday for this season and I think Q4 is going to be much better for them.", "Manufacturing and high-tech have furloughs and ramp downs in Q3. This is also seasonal. And the parts of manufacturing that are usually trending towards -- servicing, oil and gas, energy clients, et cetera have trouble, but industrial manufacturing have lots of M&A going on and therefore there's good uptake in M&A work.", "Across all these industries, if we approach them as traditional IT services providers, then discretionary spend will be tight and we will have some trouble. However, we have seen especially in these sectors a big uptick in our people plus software strategy of their far more amenable to more powerful more disruptive CapEx led spending, offerings like Skava, Mana, Edge, et cetera, they have the most uptick in these area.", "I'm very optimistic as we move into Q3 and Q4 other than seasonal trends that these new models will pick up and drive growth in the industry. I will pass it on to Mohit for his thoughts.", "Mohit Joshi", "So, this is Mohit Joshi, I'll cover financial services, and then healthcare insurance and life sciences. So, financial services, as you would have noticed for the past few quarters, we've had really a very strong performance for the current quarter. Also, if you even if you strip out the insurance fees, financial services quarter-on-quarter grew at over 4.5%.", "Growth for us was very broad-based sales. So, this is across industries sub-segment. This was across geographies and across service lines. I think our key message of industrialization, which matches with the new agenda for our clients and the message how new, which is around digital disruption, around design thinking, around new AI used cases. I think that is resonating very strongly and our competitive position is very strong. So, in a number of consolidation deals, for instance, we have won larger pieces of work.", "On the flip side, in terms of the headwinds, we had spoken about a large project ramp down and as has been happening over the past few quarters, the low interest rate or the negative interest rate regime has meant that client spending has been more on the start-stop basis.", "But I do want to underscore the very strong performance we had in the past few quarters and the very strong competitive positioning the few develop in this industry as you know, very strong modes for us, right, so that's on financial services.", "Insurance, again like I mentioned, we've done extremely well. Growth has been over 5%. There is a lot of focus among our clients on digital distribution, on claims and policy, admin modernization, on customer acquisition, and insurance is a sector where we are leading with client acquisition.", "So, we have an existing portfolio of clients globally, but the new account acquisition in this sector has been particularly strong and that leads me to be optimistic about the outlook for our business in this sector for the next half year.", "Healthcare, we have done exceedingly well. We had double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth rate and again in healthcare as well, growth is backed by very strong new client acquisition, a huge amount of interest in our clients and our on our innovation and automation agenda.", "In healthcare, we've seeing significant opportunities in care management, Medicare, Medicaid expansion, international expansion, and obviously compliance. So, we have a very strong team and a strong client franchise in healthcare, which is also reacting very well to some of the things that Sandeep spoke about in terms of the robotic process automation in terms of AI.", "Life sciences is a business where if you recollect in Q1, we've spoken about a very large consulting-led program coming to an end and we had a little bit of an overhang of that in this quarter as well.", "We are seeing some amount of insourcing by some of our key clients, but again, and there is a spend in this industry itself which is challenged, but again life sciences over the past two years has been one of our highest-performing businesses with strong double-digit growth in both the years. Again a strong client franchise, so I do expect that in the next half year, this will perform well above industry average.", "Rajesh Krishnamurthy", "Yes, hi, this is Rajesh and I will give a quick commentary on the industries I look after. So, I manage Resources, Energy Utilities, Telecom and Services business for Infosys. The Resources and Energy industries are clearly still reeling under the impact of low commodity prices and low oil prices.", "On the oil side, there has been lot of -- I guess this morning the prices gone marginally above $50. But overall the industry is actually craving stability and I think we've seen a series of ups and downs and that is not really a good sign for companies to open up their wallets and make investments.", "So, in these two industries, it is really about operational efficiency and looking at cost takeout. I think a lot of that has been done industry-- at least the oil industry have been practicing the spit for 40 and how companies can still continue to be profitable at $40 a barrel. But I think overall demand being what it is and the gap between supply and demand still quite significant, I think this is something which will probably continue for some time.", "The best performing sector for us is the utilities industry. This is where we have had our maximum growth. Overall, the ECS segment recorded a record 7% plus growth this quarter and it was primarily driven to a large extent to the utilities industry.", "This is where we're seeing opportunities on two fronts, one, of course, utilities are also trying to get leaner and get more efficient, and that's where we're seeing a lot of uptick, but we're also seeing utility spending a lot in transformations of how they are engaged with their clients.", "And one of the big investment areas for utility is a huge opportunity for us is how customers who have legacy systems and operated their backend systems for long periods of time are now having to create front end layers, which are more nimble, more agile, so that they can respond to the client needs in a more -- so we're looking at a disambiguation of the systems, which is creating a lot of opportunities for us.", "On the telecom side, again, huge pressure on both topline and bottom-line because of the nature of the industry, because of the competition and here it has been quite cyclical, last quarter we had a bumper quarter in telecom. This quarter was relatively muted. So, overall, the ECS segment has done very well this quarter and we expect the momentum to continue in Q3, Q4 as well. And I've been told to keep quiet now.", "James Friedman", "Okay. It\u2019s a talented team. Thank you very much for that detailed response, Vishal. I'll go back into the queue.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thanks. Thanks a lot Jamie.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have next question from the line of Ravi Menon from Elara Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon", "Thank you for the opportunity. So, Vishal I'd just like to ask you, few find certain parts of the service line I'd say more receptive to improving win rates at your proposition of I'd say that the new areas or the new way of thinking that you're bringing about and some parts maybe less so like for instance infrastructure management services perhaps being less susceptible to that versus application development?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Perhaps Ravi you can provide this answer to Ravi. The overall what we see Ravi is the growth across all the service lines and of course they all have different characteristics and different value proposition.", "But generally, we're seeing strong growth in all the service lines, they are driven by different parameters and application development and maintenance it is driven by improving the productivity through automation and bringing experience improvements for design thinking, infrastructure management is all about automation and cloud and so forth. Perhaps Ravi you can talk about -- the question was around which service lines are more prone to innovation and higher margin and attractive traction.", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes, so, all service lines has some way of looking at automation and innovation. So, once which are more amenable for automation are application development and maintenance enterprise packet applications, infrastructure services. But having said that each and every other service line does have an opportunity because we're looking at the complete value chain of these services spectrum.", "Each of them has a new part of it just to give an example in engineering services at the digital twin is the new of what we could do in engineering services. In application development and maintenance, we're seeing quite a bit of work on legacy modernization.", "In digital experience, taking a process and digitizing it. In BPO services, we have a lot of new offerings in digital media optimization and creating insights in analytics. So, each of these service lines I believe do have an opportunity to innovate or an opportunity to automate. We just have to look for it.", "Ravi Menon", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand over the floor to Sandeep Mahindroo for his closing comments. Over to you, sir.", "Sir, over to you for closing comments.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Yes, hi, this is Vishal. So, just to close we had a great Q2. We're proud of our execution. As we said both in August and at the end of prior Q1, largely internal factors had got us to the point of our performance in Q1 and we focused on those, we overcame that, we had strong performance, of 4.7% constant currency performance in our core services as well as improvements in all the operational parameters, and continued strength in our new areas.", "So, I'm really satisfied with the way the team has performed, and the results that we have achieved. While we see some headwinds as we look at the next two quarters, which has got us to the revision in our guidance downwards to 8% to 9% constant currency for this year, and obviously so we will strive to ensure that we deliver a great performance in these two quarters.", "When we look beyond that, what we see is that our industry is going through a fairly structural transformation. And when I look around, I find that our company, both in terms of renewing our core services with automation and grassroots innovation as well as brining new services that are the defining areas for our business, for our client, in that all important parameters, we're doing very well and that gives me more than anything else, the comfort for the future.", "So, thank you very much and we look forward to seeing you many of you over the course of the quarter and then the next earnings.", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, with this we conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Hello everyone, and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q3 FY17 earnings release. This is Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining on this call today is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath, along with other members of the senior management team.", "We\u2019ll start the call with some remarks on the performance of the Company by Dr. Sikka and Mr. Ranganath. Subsequently, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Please note that anything which we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risk the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Dr. Sikka.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Thanks, Sandeep. Hello everyone, and welcome to our earnings call, and Happy New Year. You will recall that in October, we have mentioned that in addition to the seasonal headwinds in Q3 on account of furloughs and lower working days, we also have additional headwinds on account of RBS ramp down, impacting our Q3 revenue growth.", "RBS impacted Q3 revenues by about 1%. After taking into account the above, our Q3 revenue performance was broadly in line with our expectations; Q3 revenues declined by 0.3% in constant currency terms and 1.4% in reported U.S. dollar terms. In terms of growth nine months of the fiscal year over the first nine months of the last fiscal year, our revenues have grown by 9.4% in constant currency terms and 8.3% in U.S. dollar terms.", "We also marked the significant achievement of crossing $10 billion in revenue on an LTM basis during calendar 2016. I want to thank all the employees from past and present, founders, board members and all those who have helped us achieve this significant milestone.", "Net employee additions were 5,719 in the first nine months of fiscal \u201917 compared to 17,196 in the first nine months of fiscal \u201916, which is a significant reduction. We continue our relentless focus on introduction automation across our projects in the backdrop of pricing pressure in traditional services, and we expect this to reflect in our future hiring.", "On the margin front, we have made progress by progressing on operational efficiencies. The first nine months margins are at 24.7%, which is in the upper half of the 24 to 25 margin band that we had given from the year. While some operating metrics are lower in Q3 as compared to Q2, it should be seen in light of the RBS ramp down, which impacted these beyond the normal Q3 seasonality. Ranga will provide more color on the operational efficiency parameters and margins.", "We continue to sharply focus on strong execution of our strategy in terms of large deal when it\u2019s top client growth, new services momentum, automation, operational efficiencies and talent engagement. We had eight large deal went in Q3 with the TCV of $664 million. This comprised of $436 million of committed value deals and $228 million of claim work deals.", "Our talent attention, both at our senior level and overall organization level, has been healthy. Attrition in Q3 came down to 14.9% compared to 15.7% in Q2. Among high performers, we continue to see attrition at consistently lower levels, and I believe this is due to our ongoing investments, our employee equity program, differential rewards for high performers, talent engagement to the Zero Distance, and giving high performers and challenging opportunities to grow into new roles.", "At the management level, we have a strong committed and stable senior management team. In any large scale transformation, we have to bring in new external talent and promote top talent from within as we did today with the announcement of Ravi as the Deputy COO. Coming to the business outlook for fiscal \u201817, based on our year-to-date performance and our current assessment, we have revised our constant currency guidance from 8% to 9%, to 8.4% to 8.8% for fiscal \u201817. Over the next three months, we will focus on strengthening our foundation for fiscal \u201918 with a strong Q4.", "On the new administration taking office in the U.S. next week, while we are closely watching the development as they unfold, in the absence of visibility on the outcome and the timelines involved in any visa reform, it is difficult to assess the impact of such possible developments on our business.", "Now, to the execution of our renewed new strategy and our culture of learning; on revenue per employee, if we exclude RBS, we can see that the revenue per employee is improving, despite significant ongoing pricing pressure. I believe this points to the benefits of automation and our efforts in Zero Distance kicking in and our move towards higher value work.", "In addition, we see the evidence of our strategy execution in our client survey results at their highest levels since we started the survey 12 years ago. And, in particular, at the highest level ever at the CXO level, with the staff improvement over the last two years, 22 points increase at the CXO level. In my personal interactions with clients, artificial intelligence is now at the forefront of everyone\u2019s thinking along with driving digital transformation becoming more agile and bringing ongoing innovation. And clients now view Infosys as increasingly a strategic partner in these fundamental areas.", "In renew, in Q3, we continue to make progress in key areas. Zero Distance, our program to drive grassroots innovation in every project, continues to thrive and evolve. More than 95% of projects are now covered by Zero Distance as we are -- and we are starting to see this program to monetize into the terms. Key Zero Distance examples include LexisNexis, Arizona Public Service and ABN AMRO, among others. Going forward, our focus would be on collaboration and learning across the Zero Distance streams, and on looking for bigger problem to solve, breakthrough opportunities that can have a significant impact for clients.", "In our mainframe modernization service, we are seeing continued demand across verticals and are already working with 25 of the top 50 Infosys clients in moving their mainframe and legacy landscapes to the cloud. Clients see clear value in moving their mainframe workers to the cloud, saving as much as 35% of the run cost through Infosys services and through our partnership with the AWS and Microsoft. And in the case of DBS Bank, the move to the cloud improved their database performance and more than 100 times compared to what they were using before.", "Internally, we are leveraging our own automation solutions to drive greater efficiencies into all of our service lines. In Q3, we estimate that we how of 2,650 FTEs lots of effort, primarily in application maintenance, package system maintenance, BPO, and infrastructure management. Zero Bench, our program to engage employees in value creation while they are between projects, has created more than 31,800 work packets with more than 15,000 work packets already completed through the end of Q3.", "In new areas, Q3 was a healthy quarter for us in all the new software capabilities. And we saw tremendous client adoption and excitement around Mana, Skava, Panaya and Edge, each of which have their best quarter ever. On Mana, we saw client adoption more than double compared to previous quarters. What is particularly encouraging is that in Q3 Mana was adopted as much for automating IT services work as its solving lot of business problems like reducing contracts to shelf time for apparel companies, driving fraud and risk management for banks, et cetera. Key new Mana clients include Kraft Heinz and AMD.", "On Skava, we saw a strong Black Friday on retail e-commerce side where volumes are up more than 30%. We also saw great interest from conversion from CPG companies for their direct to consumer strategies and interest from customer services companies on loyalty management from telecom companies to broaen their client engagement and in many other areas. [08.33] for example, have selected Skava to power all of their e-commerce.", "The EdgeVerve business delivered solid results with 18 wins and 21 go-lives from both Finacle and Edge. At this stage, our leading platform in the so called robotic process automation space has its best quarter ever. And key highlights for EdgeVerve this quarter was a launch of a pilot blockchain network for the Emirates New Business Development Bank in the UAE and ICICI Bank. Panaya had its best quarter ever, both in terms of bookings and revenue. Overall, the new software line of business grew much faster than the Company, more than 33% faster, and we expect software to continue to amplify the work of our teams.", "In Design Thinking, we continue to work with clients in their key strategic areas. Just one example in Q3 was a rewarding Design Thinking engagement with Fudan University School of Management in Shanghai to help them to re-imagine the learning experience and design their new digital campus of the future. In addition, we are actively piloting an online marketplace, initially leveraging our bench resources for outside work.", "In culture, learning continues to be our main focus. We have now trained more than 125,000 employees in design thinking. We are accelerating thereof an agile training to up-skill in-demand areas with 50% of our project managers and 7,200 overall employees already trained on these techniques. And we continued to focus on the core competency of new trainees with every pressure now required to be trained in the minimum of three programming languages simultaneously. 10,400 people with this requirement in this program have already been trained, and brought into delivery.", "To nurture further the future development talent and high performers, we continue to invest, as I mentioned at the beginning, our employee equity program, Zero Distance, our new apprenticeship program, the Stanford Executive Education Program now with 130 of our leaders as a part this program. And the leadership blueprint, all are critical to this and we will continue these efforts.", "Looking beyond business, in India, the Infosys Foundation has invested in several impactful programs across wide spectrum areas, including rehabilitation, art and culture, education and rural development. Some of the key initiatives of the quarter include the curation of the Infosys Foundation Anupu Festival, sponsorship of a kitchen in Hyderabad in partnership with Akshay Patra Foundations, and an endowment to Sahapedia, an NGO for the development of an online interactive web module on arts, culture and history of India. Development of an sustainable village in Madhya Pradesh through Shiv Ganga Samudra, Gram Vikas Parishad along with many other investments.", "In the U.S., Infosys Foundation USA celebrated completed a science education week, announcing multiple grants to enable underrepresented students across nine states that had core Computer Science and coding. The foundation also renewed its partnership with Code.org, one of the most active CS education advocacy organizations worldwide. The Foundation honored 10 Computer Science teachers with awards of excellence in partnership with ACM and CSTA, and also launched a new cycle of the entry maker awards for this year.", "As of September 30, 2016, the Foundation has had significant impact on Computer Science education by enabling more than 134,000 students includes the 2,500 schools across all 50 states to gain access to Computer Science and maker education. This was made possible by supporting more than 2,500 teachers with critical resources such as Computer Science teacher training, new classroom technology, and teaching aids, and Makerspace. In addition, the 179 coding workshops, hackathons, and coding clubs were held during the after-school were also supported by the Foundation. We have continued to build on all of these in Q3.", "We continue to see many promising signs that we are executing along our strategy, and indeed our longer-term path to thrive in the times of AI. Do not become displaced by automation, but indeed to become a Company of innovators where the AIs of our creation solve the great business problems that we find. Our results and the voice of our clients provide the proof points around there, and we will continue to build on this.", "I will now hand it over to Ranga to provide more details on our financials. Thank you.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you, Vishal. Hello everyone, Ranga here. Let me start by saying that in Q3 we continued to focus on improving the operational efficiency of business, and maintaining healthy cash flow generation. As you know, Q3 is a seasonally soft quarter due to preloads and lower working days. In addition, as we have stated earlier in October, this time we had additional headwinds on account of RBS ramp down.", "In dollar terms, our revenues in Q3 where $2,551 million this is a growth of 6% when compared to Q3 of fiscal \u201816. On a sequential basis, revenues were down 1.4%. On a year-on-year basis, when compared to Q3 fiscal \u201916, revenues have grown 7.3% in constant currency terms. Sequentially, our revenues in dollar terms were down by 0.3% on constant currency terms.", "Impact on revenues on account of RBS ramp down was over 1% in Q3, in reported terms. If you look at the first nine months of this fiscal over first nine months of last fiscal, revenues have grown by 8.3% in dollar terms and 9.4% in constant currency terms. Volumes grew by 0.2% during the quarter. On quarter-to-quarter basis, on-take volume increased by 0.6% and offshore volume increased by 0.1%. The ramp down in RBS impacted volume growth by over 2% during the quarter.", "Realization for the quarter declined by 2.2% on reported basis and 1.1% on constant currency basis as compared to Q2 of \u201817. As you know, there will be quarter-on-quarter fluctuations, hence, and more appropriate indicator of realizations would be nine months of FY17 over nine months of FY16. On this measure, realization declined by 2.8% in reported term and 1.8% in constant currency terms.", "As Vishal mentioned earlier, this quarter's operating parameters should be seen in the light of RBS ramp down as they were impacted beyond the normal Q3 seasonality. Our utilization, excluding trainees, was 81.9%. Similarly, utilization, including trainees, went up to a healthy of 77.8%. Utilization, excluding trainees, has been consistently above 80% over the last seven quarters due to better talent planning and talent supply chain. Onsite mix stands at 29.8% during the quarter.", "If you look on a nine month basis, utilization, excluding trainees, improved to 81.6% as compared to 80.7% for the corresponding period last year. This is again an increase. Onsite mix increased to 29.8% in nine months. Likewise, on a nine month basis -- likewise, Subcon expenses were 5.6% of revenues in Q3 in comparison to 6.3% in Q3 of last year. DSO for the quarter was 69 days compared to 64 days in Q2 of '17. This was primarily due to unbilled revenues, which declined by $82 million during the quarter.", "Coming to operating margins, our operating margins for the quarter was 25.1%, increase of 20 basis points over Q2 of '17. During the quarter, rupee depreciated by 1.2% against U.S. dollar, which helped operating margins by 30 basis points. However, this was offset by 30 basis point decline due to the cross currency impact. Our standard cost declined during the quarter by 130 basis points due to savings on account of lower variable pay and lower leave cost. Lower leave cost was primarily in account of higher leave utilization in the quarter, leave lapsing in certain on-site countries and increasing interest rates.", "This was offset by decrease realization, which impacted the margins by 30 basis points; increase in CSR contribution, which we have to make in India mandatorily, which impacted margins by 40 basis points; and increase in third party software and other comps of 40 basis points, leading to an overall expansion of 20 basis points in operating margins.", "Our emphasis on the healthy operating cash flow generation continued this quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $547 million in Q3 compared to $474 million in the last year same quarter. Operating cash flow, as percent of net profit, was 100% this quarter, which reflects healthy cash generation. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31st was $5,255 million compared to $5,349 million last quarter. During the quarter, you may recall that we paid interim dividend, including tax of $453 million.", "We added 9,120 gross employees during the quarter, while the employee count declined at the group level by 66. As Vishal said earlier, our net employee addition in the first nine months of this quarter was 5,719, which is significantly lower than 17,196 in the first nine months of last quarter -- last year.", "The quarterly annualized attrition on a standalone basis has decreased by 80 basis points to 14.9%. Likewise, at the group level, also annualized attrition declined to 18.4% now it gains 20% last quarter. Q3 saw volatility in cross currency, especially due to changes in political landscape in the U.S., increasing interest rates in the U.S. and expectations of further upward rate revision.", "We managed to navigate the volatility effectively. On a period end basis, U.S. dollar appreciated by 5.3% against British pound, 5.6% against euro, and 5.2% against Australian dollar. Our hedge position as of December 31st was $1,215 million. We expect near-term volatility in cross-currency and rupee, and we continue to manage the same through appropriate hedges.", "Yield on cash balances was 7.7% in Q3 \u201917 compared to 7.8% previous quarter. We expect yield for fiscal \u201917 to be approximately 7.5% as compared to 8.6% in financial year \u201916 due to continuing reduction in interest rates in India in the backdrop of demonetization initiative that was effective November 16th. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%. Full year effective tax rate projection for fiscal \u201917 is expected to be around 29%.", "Our net margin during the quarter was 21.5% as compared to 20.8% in Q2 \u201817. Our EPS for the quarter was $0.24. EPS grew 4.4% on year-on-basis, and by 1.5% on a sequential basis. EPS for nine months this fiscal grew 5.1% in dollar terms.", "Coming to margin expectations, we will continue to optimize the operational efficiency levers on an ongoing basis. In October, we had indicated that the margin guidance for fiscal \u201917 to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For the first nine months of fiscal \u201817, our actual operating margins were 24.7%, hence, we have kept the margin band unchanged at 24%, 25% for fiscal \u201917.", "With that, we will open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "My first question is just on IT budgets for 2017, wanted to get your initial impression on what those budgets look like. And any change in the optimism, particularly in financial services, given the new administration here in the U.S.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Joseph, this is Vishal. No significant change, the balance of course changes towards the newer areas, digital, cloud, some of the AI applications, effectively towards operational efficiencies and better customer understanding, customer experience, and so forth. But no particular change. With regard to BFSI, maybe Mohit you can answer.", "Mohit Joshi", "So I think on the financial services side, there is a degree of optimism that we have about the spend in the U.S. over the next 12 months; it\u2019s obviously, it has a sub-vertical flavor to it. So on the investment banking and on the asset management side, there is still a degree of caution. But overall, we feel that the cost reduction will remain a priority for our clients in the next year. The savings that they get from cost reduction, right those are going to be driven into transmission programs, which will be positive for us. That\u2019s the perspective we have as of now.", "Joseph Foresi", "And then just the automation question, I think the idea here is that the automation is going to keep pace with pricing, and be able to offset the pressure there. So that margins sort of stay stable. So, I wonder, could you update us on your thoughts on that over the short and long-term? Do you feel like automation is going to keep pace? And also we\u2019ve seen a couple of, I guess, FTEs taken out. Is that pace of FTE takeout consistent pace over the next couple of quarters?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, if you look at the pace that we have taken out this FTE effort, it is increasing. We have added to it. It was 2,300 or so in Q2, and it\u2019s now 2,650. So, that number is continually increasing. And yet, Mana is still in the early days of its adoptions; so, none of these numbers actually reflect any Mana and option so far. So, as you said, the basic idea of automation is to outperform the declining pricing curve. And as Ranga mentioned, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the pricing decline was 1.1% in constant currency, and 1.8%, if you look at it over a nine months period. So, this number is steadily coming down, that\u2019s what I have been talking about for the last two and half years.", "However, it is not enough to simply outperform the downward pace of that spiral pretty soon that will become table stakes. What is even more important is to ensure that the automation continues to impact the deeper and higher level work, such as application maintenance, 31 application developments and brings more productivity improvement to that.", "And one of the things that I have found that is extremely important as we bring automation to life, in particular with our Mana platform, is that the same, the automation, it\u2019s not for the automation software to apply just to our own IT services, but it is important for that platform also to really enabler of new kinds of applications that were unprecedented that, like some of the examples that I mentioned before. A lot of companies in our industry are bringing automations simply for their own services.", "And I believe that by doing that one would not be able to build world class automation software that can stand, that can bring the best of what is known outside in other domains. And therefore it is essential for us to apply the automation software also to building standalone next generation breakthrough application.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it, okay. And then -- go ahead.", "Mohit Joshi", "Just to add to that, I think, coming to the impact of automation positive impact of automation on our end, there are couples of, as Vishal said, to the extent that the internal productivity and automation offsets the pricing decline that would beginning to show. One of the leading indicators, probably that we have started to watch closely, but of course we don\u2019t want to call it as a trend line or anything, but we have started monitoring that very closely is really what is the rate of headcount addition into the Company as compared to the rate of revenue growth.", "If you look at the first nine months of this quarter, this year, the net headcount addition across the group, including BPO, has been 5,700 people. For the same period, last year, last fiscal nine months, it was 17,000. So, there has been reduction in net headcount. So we are kind of internally monitoring how much of this is really on account of the release of people from the projects on account of higher productivity and automation.", "The important thing to note is also that the automation impact on the P&L would be much more significant if that happens across the pyramid, the pyramids both on-site in India. So that\u2019s something which we want to closely monitor, so that both on headcount release as well as the quality of headcount release, both are important.", "Joseph Foresi", "And then last one from me, I wanted to see if I can get your early thoughts on the new administration. One of your competitors had talked about already taking a close look at the way that they deliver their services, based on some potentially protections policies here in the U.S. So, if you could just talk about, is that that something you\u2019re renewing? And I know it's early to tell, but any early thoughts on how you address it? Thanks.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, there are two parts of that. One is that overall, on a longer term horizon, I see that the administration in going to be a business friendly and innovation friendly kind of an administration. The president elect itself is entrepreneurial business man with a very successful carrier around, based on entrepreneurship. So I expect that -- so our view is that, as long as we are able to be relevant to our clients in that kind of a business friendly, innovation friendly atmosphere, we are going to be okay.", "And the second part, the near term part, is regarding the potential impact due to visa policy changes and thing of this nature; so, obviously, depending on the nature of the policy that is adopted that there could be impact to this so the work that we do. While we don\u2019t know what kind of policies will be going into effect, we are preparing to address different scenarios based on what might happen. And ultimately it all comes down to basically two things; more local hiring, which is something that I have been emphasizing anyways, and tried that two and a half years ago, I am myself a high level U.S. local hire.", "And so the more that we can bring local talent to work closely with clients, bring the contextual sense of innovation to their work, and bolster that with deep global expertise coming in from the outside the better. And so we are deeply committed to the U.S. economy growth in there and so forth. We have also seen that in other geographies in Australia, for example. And Singapore, Singapore already enacted the 50-50 law that we have been complying with.", "And so depending on the nature of the policy that is adopted, we will take the necessary measures and that might have some impact in the near term, which we will see depending on the nature of the policy. But ultimately, the solution here is better local hiring, more strength in the local economies and local markets. And there is strong long-term focus on innovation and software-led the delivery of value.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have next question from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Vishal and Ranga, during last quarter a large portion of your TCV came from renewals. Can you quantify the renewal mix this quarter? And then could that be one of the reasons why we\u2019ve seen some of the pricing pressure that Vishal has been talking about?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Moshe, this quarter it was -- the total number was 664, and out of that 436 was committed value deals and 228 was framework renewal deals.", "Moshe Katri", "And could the renewals, actually be one of those factors that\u2019s actually impacting pricing, the pricing compression that we\u2019re seeing?", "Pravin Rao", "So Moshe, this is Pravin here. We normally don\u2019t give that split, because seasonally, there is a renewal that it's a net new expense. So, it\u2019s difficult to figure out how much is pure, and even then how much is new. But this time I think we had as compared with last quarter, we had much more new than renew in this quarter.", "Moshe Katri", "Can you give us some color on pricing? Could that be one of the reasons impacting pricing for the business?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "No, I don\u2019t think so, Moshe. This is independent of that. The pricing decline is something that we see across the industry. We have -- we checked it out in early days, a lot of people used to doubt that may be there is probably something that this was something only we saw. But now we have seen that it is a consistent industry-wide trend, and it applies renewal of existing deals, ongoing projects and so forth.", "The new services, or both the new software-led services and the new services in general, continued to be highly valued, highly profitable. Some of the things I talk about, for example, around migrating mainframe systems to the cloud, new digital services, AI-based applications, the Mana, Skava, Panaya based services these are all services that have significant margin potential.", "Moshe Katri", "And then the digital mix, can you kind of quantify that for the quarter, and what sort of growth rates are we looking at?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So maybe Ravi, Ravi, the question from Moshe is about that the digital mix. Perhaps you can answer that?", "Ravi Venkatesan", "Yes. So actually, benchmark or baseline with a market on the digital ecosystem because everybody measures it differently, I have digital services and the digital experience unit which is 100%. The Skava services and the Skava ecosystem is 100% digital. Then there is a part of cloud packages, cloud package applications, which is literally in the digital world because is it is a part of the digital ecosystem, and there is integration services to the backend and digital, which is again digital. So, in effect, every service line has something related to digital.", "What we do internally is we kind of look at metrics to see whether we are moving up, and are we growing in line with the market spend. And I actually believe that we are seriously competitive in that space, as well as we\u2019re winning a lot of the new spend. Our entire proposition of amplifying human experience by digitizing corporations, primarily through innovation and automation, and that has actually resonated very well with clients.", "So I really don\u2019t want to put a number on-board, because it would just confuse you because the base lines for each company are very different on how you measure digital. But I actually believe that this is growing significantly faster than the Company, and it is in line with, or rather in line -- and we are a market leader in the space of leveraging digital spend in the market.", "Moshe Katri", "And I just want to speak in the last one. So Ranga, your utilization rate was fairly high 81.9%. Are we -- are these sustainable levels for the near-term, I guess, continuing to push utilization rate above 80%?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Well, coming to utilization, if you were to collect last four-five quarters, we\u2019ve being seeing that due to better supply chain management and current planning, we aim to be moving that upwards. You should expect that till about six-seven quarters ago, it is to be consistently below 70, usually just to be between 77 and 80. So, we had this reorganization about with little over five quarters where we consolidated all the service lines in delivery under one umbrella. So that\u2019s the moment of people from one set of each line to another became much easier, we thought that, which is boundaries. Then we also strengthened the planning and the supply chain.", "So, I think steadily this kind of started inching upwards. So if you look at last seven quarter, in each of the seven quarters, it has been consistently above 80, currently, this quarter 81.9. And if you recollect couple of quarters ago, we have had close to 83, 82.7 to 83. We do believe that around that level, between 83, 84, that level in the near to medium terms is something that we want to plan. And the second one on the utilization is also a denominator effect, which essentially is also equally important, so a combination of these two. Yes, we want to kind of optimize, certainly, above 80 and there is some legroom that we want to do it in the medium term.", "Operator", "Thank you. We take next question from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois", "I want to ask about Infosys\u2019 longer-term strategy here. Given the increasing role of software-led business in your strategy, what\u2019s your general view on how much of Infosys\u2019 revenues should stem from software assets as you look forward, perhaps to the 2020 timeframe that you guys have talked about?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "The, so would have mentioned. So that Rod, there is the impact of software in amplifying the existing services where the software itself may not be monetized, and may become a part of the overall fix price offering or the overall solution that we put together for the client. And the other one is the standalone software business itself where the software is monetized as a service and that could either be licensed an AMC and so forth.", "When we talked about 2020, $20 billion number, our idea was that 10% of the revenue would come from new services, including software. And currently, it's approximately 5% of our revenue. And we mentioned this is in the fact sheet if you look at it, you\u2019ll see the products and the platform revenues, and they are highlighted at around 5%. So, we are looking -- the game plan is over the next two years to double this thing.", "And as I mentioned Mana, Skava, Edge, and Panaya together had the best -- each of them had the best quarter ever individually. And Mana\u2019s option has been doubling. We are selling Mana now pretty much exclusively as a service. And Skava is available both as a service and as an upfront license, similarly the Edge product. And Panaya is also exclusively as a service. So, one of the things that we are going to work on over the course of this quarter is how to better -- and then provide to you one more color and the final granularity on how the software businesses evolving.", "And other thing that we are thinking about over the course of this quarter and in the times ahead is how to expand the go-to-market of this beyond the relatively small number of clients that you think are from a software point of view that a services company has. So our total number of clients currently is about 1,000, and typically it's on a software business you have a much larger client base. So these are things that we are thinking about.", "Rod Bourgeois", "And have you updated your 2020 financial targets, or are they the same as they were when we were speaking about those about a year or so ago?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So the 2020 is an aspiration, we don\u2019t actually have a business plan or a financial plan to get there. We make the plan on a yearly basis, and at a Company level. And individual businesses do have multiyear plans and so forth. But the 2020 is an aspiration that we have kept for ourselves to help shape our thinking, whether it is the renewal of our existing services and business, the kind of new mixes and new horizons to add into that, as well as the bringing in inorganic revenue and investments and so forth through acquisitions and investments. So there isn\u2019t a tangible plan for 2020. But the business plans exist for the individual service lines and at a Company level we do it for the year.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Well, maybe one final point on that. I mean, when you think about that aspirational plan for 2020, what has changed in your mind in the last year based on what you\u2019ve seen in the market and based on the experience you\u2019ve had with rolling out automation. What's changed in your mind relative to those aspirational targets? In other words, are you more confident in the margin target, are you less confident? Are you thinking differently about the mix of revenues that you\u2019re going to pursue for 2020. What's the big change based on the experience you\u2019ve had in the market on how you are thinking today about that aspiration versus where you were a year ago?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "That\u2019s a great question. I think that transformation is never easy. And some of the things that we have seen, for example, bringing Mana or automation platforms to life for the existing IT services business is an easier sell, easier for our teams to relate to that and bring that to market. Whereas, brand new solutions on the platform require a different kind of DNA, different kind of a mind set, so we need a combination of both.", "Similarly, on the pricing front, I would say that ever since I started, I have been talking about the downward pricing pressure. And that has, in many ways, intensified and continued and has intensified. So there is no doubt that this is a secular trend that is heading in a very more fundamental way impacting the industry. And you can see that also and the moves being made by others in the industry. So, there is no doubt that software-led software amplified services strategy is the right one here.", "And the other part of it is that it has to be, as I mentioned earlier in response to another question, it has to be not only a software-led or a software amplified services strategy for our existing services, it also has to be that the software also brings value for additional use cases. And this means that quickly the software business would need to expand beyond, for example, the top 500 clients that we have. So we have to, overtime, think about additional go-to-market channels and so forth, in bringing that to life.", "So those have been, as we have gone through this journey, those have been some of the learnings that we have found. Of course in the near term, this is still quite early. In the term, we are busy for the next 12 to 18 months. We are busy bringing these software amplified services to our existing businesses, to our existing services, to our existing clients. And as we expand beyond that, these new strategies would start to play an important role.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "My first question is for Ranga. I was wondering where we are with the RBS journey? I apologize we can\u2019t remember. But are we closer to the end than the middle of that?", "M. D. Ranganath", "If you recollect in August of 2016, we announced, when we announced the ramp down, 3000 people. We had said that much of the impact will not be in Q2, but in Q3 and Q4. But on a sequential basis, we do not see, by enlarge, negligible impact on a sequential basis in Q4. So, that\u2019s where the RBS impact. So if you look at Q3, it was a little over 1.1%.", "James Friedman", "Just so I heard you\u2019re right, it sounds like we\u2019re done with the RBS transfer?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Very negligible in Q4, very negligible\u2026", "Mohit Joshi", "So this is Mohit. And I can confirm the largest part of that impact has gone, so this is something that\u2019s just a very small residual piece left in terms of the impact.", "James Friedman", "And then, Vishal, I know it\u2019s early days. But could help us to think about what some of the factors might be that would encourage fiscal 2018 to grow, either slower or faster than fiscal \u201817?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "I think, first of all, we have to deliver a strong Q4 to help establish a great base for the beginning of the year. So, my entire team is here, and just to be absolutely clear. But beyond that, I think that my sense is that, I mean, if you just look at the overall atmosphere around, independent of the seasonal or the event-oriented things, whether it is Brexit or the U.S. presidential elections and so forth, the bigger change that is happening in the world around us is the technology-driven change. It is a change where every industry, every business is going through a very, very fundamental transformation towards software, towards AI, towards technology.", "And so therefore, my view is a deeper embrace of our strategy at an even more accelerated base is going to be necessary in FY \u201918. And I\u2019m really -- what my experience this year has been that every business is looking for advice, every business is looking for strategic partners to help them think about their journey. In many ways, the traditional models of consulting and strategy and so forth don\u2019t really deliver the results. If you think about the Fortune 500 over the last 10 years, ever since the iPhone was launched, I mean, something like 34%, 35% of the Fortune 500 companies are not in the Fortune 500 anymore. Some of them have actually gone out of business. And that seems, the way I look at it, it seems to me to be a profound failure of the source, the strategy, the consulting, the innovation and enterprise.", "And I think that as companies think about this exponential and deeply accelerated transformation that is happening in the world around us, around technology, they\u2019re looking for new kind of a partner to help them achieve, both their cost savings that can outpace the disruption that comes, as well as in particular going in the new areas and new ways. So, the more that we bring these capabilities, both in our existing services and in our new services to our clients, the better that we become at articulating and monetizing these opportunities, the better off we will be. So these are -- this is going to be, I mean, fiscal \u201818 is going to be a pivotal year in this transformation journey.", "And I\u2019m really excited. I mean, if you look at our customer satisfaction survey, in many ways, the first survey CSAT survey that I saw when I started came in a month after I joined Infosys. It was really depressing to see that one back then. And ought of the thinking that we put into place, the Zero Distance, the embrace of automation, and in particular the massive roll-out of Design Thinking and creating a culture of grassroots innovation and everything that we do. They\u2019re all motivated by the voice of the customer that I heard at that time. And in two years we have seen a dramatic change in that. We have been doing this survey for something like 12 years, and in those 12 year, this is the highest rating that we have ever had from a client. And our CXO scores, in particular, have jumped dramatically in these last two years.", "So it tells us that even that is early days and we are still impacted by currency, by the RBS type ramp down, and furloughs and all these things that apply to everybody and the downward pricing pressure, it does tell us that in a very fundamental and deep routed way, the change that we have been putting into place is working.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts on the Indian startup market. From the sense of is it taking away some of your better talent. And also are you looking at it as a source of ideas where you may try to acquire some of these new concepts and roll them into the Infosys portfolio?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "Ed, how are you man? You sound very different on the phone. And that\u2019s a great question. I mean, the Indian startup scene is a extremely exciting one that has ton of energy, ton of interest in that. But if you look at the broader context, I mean, the unemployment rate among Indian engineering graduates is super high, it is sky-high. The largest employers of Indian IT graduates are actually companies like Uber and Dominos, and so forth. This is a very tragic situation.", "If you look at our own thing, what I just talked about what Ranga has just talked about the first nine months of this financial year, we lowered the amount of hiring from 17,500 or so people in the previous year for the first nine months to about 5,700 this year in the first nine months, which means that our ability to hire better talent is in fact improving, not getting worse because of the startup scene. We in fact deeply encourage the startup scene. We want the startup to succeed. We want to be the company that can bring the startups product and services to live, to market, and the goal of the market. And we have been investing, we just invested in a drone company that make autonomous drones for delivery and so forth. We have invested in a startup incubator here, and so forth.", "So, I think that in many ways as I look back on the evolution of the IT services industry over the last 15-20 years, it has been a great driver of job growth in India. And now a lot of that has happened because of jobs that are increasingly mechanisable, that are increasingly susceptible to automation. These are the kinds of jobs that have moved here. And today the IT services industry employ something 3.6 million, 3.7 million people, but the large number of these are working in jobs that are easier to -- that are more prone to automation. So, these jobs are going to overtime go away. And therefore the long-term future of the Indian employment scene and the Indian high-tech scene has to be in a combination of automation and innovation. It has to be in entrepreneurships. So I think the more that we encourage entrepreneurship within our companies, as well as within the startups, the better.", "Edward Caso", "Can you talk about your hiring plans in the U.S. Obviously, you must be thinking about positioning for, however, the U.S. visa situation, may or may not change. What efforts have you done? And any kind of numbers you can put to that as far as percent of workforce that\u2019s local? Thank you.", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So this is an area that we feel that extremely important, over the last two and half years, we have been focusing heavily on this. And now obviously in light of the new policies, this is something that is going to be ever more important. Ravi has been studying this extensively, and perhaps Ravi you can add a little bit of color to this.", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes. So, while the legislation and the law, and the bills are passed and it's probably going to take time, irrespective of that, we have being very focused on local hiring for the last few quarters. In fact, we started hiring fresher from U.S. campuses in the past couple of years. So, that will continue. Our focus is to hire local and supplement skills, which are not available with the visa program. Otherwise, the focus is to hire local, both in terms of experienced hires as well as fresher from campus. We are going to step it out with more enablement and training locally, so that we could start hiring adjacent capabilities, wherever we think those specialized crews are not available.", "We\u2019re also looking for setting up specific hubs, which we have experimented with in the last couple of years. And we want to continue to do that in terms of availability of talent pools and classes of customers where they are available. So, it's a very comprehensive plan of looking at local hiring from campuses to one to four year experienced folks, adjacent capabilities, as I said, to specialized skill training and lateral hiring. So, we will continue to keep that focus and continue to invest. This was being done irrespective of how the legislation takes course.", "Edward Caso", "Hopefully, my last quick question here is the top 10 year-over-year performance was down meaningfully. Is that all RBS or is there anything else among the top 10 clients that are waiting on those statistics for your top clients?", "Dr. Vishal Sikka", "So, Ed, RBS of course is a huge part of that, and then there is seasonality. Some of those companies are high-tech and manufacturing companies, and retail companies that have a significant impact in Q3. So, we have a very deep relationship with our top 25 clients. And as you know year and half or two years ago, that was something that used to suffer, and we spend a lot of time and energy in rebuilding those relationships and strengthening those. So, I am not particularly concerned about the statistics.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "I wanted to ask two questions, first one is on pricing. The indicated pricing was a little bit worse this quarter. Where was the variance generated from? And would you insist to pay it if you look over the course of calendar year '17, would you expect pricing to be worse than the little over 1% that occurred this quarter?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Hi, Ranga here. If you look at the pricing, I think, quarter-to-quarter pricing, our realization decline may not be the very accurate indicators, because in a particular quarter, certain project ramp ups happen and that can alter or rather amplify our understate as the case maybe the pricing. Probably the more stable and more, probably a predictable indicator would be, reliable would be on the much longer period of time. So, as I was saying in my script, nine month over nine month, which is on year-on-year basis and constant currency about 1.5% to 1.8%. I think if you look at previous year also, in FY \u201816 or FY \u201815, we had a similar 1.5%. 1.1%, I would say, between 1.1% and 1.5%. So, at this point in time based on what we see on a more multiple quarter basis, we expect that to be in the current level really, around 1% to 1.1%.", "Keith Bachman", "My follow-up question relates to something that was commented on previously. And if we look at the growth rate this quarter on a constant-currency basis, a little over 7%, you\u2019re guiding the March quarter to be a little over 6% on a year-over-year basis constant currency. As you think about that growth rate, as you look out over the next 12 months compared to the hiring structure, is there implication that this is the sustained growth rate on your ability to maintain your cost structure and your ability to maintain your margins? Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Sure. I think that\u2019s a good question. Let you just give a comparison between last year and this year itself. If you remember, last year, our constant currency growth was 15.2% and our operating margin was 25%. And if you look at -- and the first nine months of last year the operating margin was 24.8%. So, if you fast forward to this year, the first nine months operating margin is same, 24.7%, and despite the constant currency growth being at least 300 to 400 basis points lower.", "So what impact has happened is we have kind of leveraged the operational efficiency pieces, the utilization and so on and so forth. So that has happened this particular year. So essentially, even though the constant currency growth for the first nine months was 300 to 400 basis points lower than the corresponding period last year, we maintained the operating margins. Now, coming to the growth rate for the next year is the current, as well as the Q4 how does it indicate. I think, Q4 exit rate is typically very important for that, because of the compounding effect that sets a very good, typically sets a very good pace for the following year.", "So if you recollect last year as well, we focused on strong execution in Q4, and we grew 1.6%, and unlike the previous several years where, where we very used to be negative, for example, if you look at fiscal '15, Q4 was negative 2.6%, prior to that negative 1%, prior to that negative. Last year Q4 was the first time in more than three years with by focusing on strong execution and being the importance of Q4 for Q4 exist rate for the following year, we had focus. So, I think our endeavor is to focus on execution in Q4, and see how -- what we delivered in Q4 and that gives us much more credible basis for forecasting FY18.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I would now like to hand over the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for his closing comments. Over to you sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us. And you may now disconnect your lines."]}

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Sandeep Mahindroo. Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Aruna. Hello, everyone and welcome to this call to discuss Infosys Q4 and FY \u201817 earnings release. I am Sandeep Mahindroo, Investor Relations here in Bangalore. Joining us today on this call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath, along with other members of the senior management team.", "We will start the call with some remarks on the performance of the company by Dr. Sikka and Mr. Ranganath. Subsequently, we will open up the call for questions. Please note that anything which we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I would now like to pass it on to Dr. Sikka.", "Vishal Sikka", "Thanks, Sandeep. Hi, everyone and thanks for joining us. Let me start by covering our performance for Q4. It is fair to say that the performance during the quarter was lower than our expectations. It is evenly soft quarter and we saw softness in consulting and retail and CPG in China as well as some other distractions. Any large scale transformation takes time, but the early years requiring a delicate balance between the dual tasks of protecting and growing the existing businesses and simultaneously exploring and entering new frontiers and the evolution of the organizational culture is also a most critical and yet fragile aspect of this.", "With this in mind, our core business showed good performance. Our products and software offerings saw some of their best quarters and we saw positive client feedback with our client survey results at their highest since the survey started 12 years ago and this also endorsed strongly our services and software, including Nelson Hall for our core services and IDC, HFS and Forrester for Mana. All our further evidence that our renewed and new strategy is moving in the right direction. They cost $10 billion in revenue and for this, I would like to thank and recognize all Infoscions past and present that have helped us to reach the significant milestone. We delivered strong operational efficiencies, declining attrition over the course of the year, now in single-digits for top performers, healthy large deal wins, robust cash generation and steady margins despite the lower growth trajectory.", "Our FY \u201817 margins are steady at 24.7% despite the impact of salary increases, cross-currency headwinds and decline in some of our traditional services. We were able to offset these headwinds through a strong focus on improvement in operational parameters like utilization and a tight control on costs. For the full year, our revenues grew 8.3% in constant currency and yet the employee count grew only 3.3%. This is reflected in revenue per employee increasing by 1.2% in reported terms and 2% in constant currency terms in FY \u201817 to $51,375 and is an outcome of our automation and productivity-related efforts. We have 6 large deal wins in Q4 with a TCV of $806 million, comprising $623 million worth of framework deals and $183 million worth of committed value deals. While the large deal signings trend line is in the right direction, more than 90% were renewed in our existing businesses and this is one metric that we will continue to monitor closely. In FY \u201817, we added 5 more $100 million accounts.", "In Q4, the attrition among top performers in IL, in Infosys Limited, was down to the single-digit as mentioned earlier. Overall attrition for IL for Q4 FY \u201817 was 13.5% quarter-to-date, a decrease from 14.9% in Q3. We continue to strengthen the management team and I am very happy to welcome Pervinder Johar as the CEO of our EdgeVerve subsidiary. Pervinder has extensive experience in building best-in-class software and cloud services and most recently, he was the CEO of a leading software company in the world of business planning.", "On the contribution from new areas, specifically, our FY \u201817 revenues from new software and software-related services, including Mana, Edge, Panaya and Skava, grew at more than 42%. Starting in Q1 of FY \u201818, we will report revenues on a quarterly basis from the new software and also from our new offerings and services such as digital services, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, the work we do in API economy, mainframe modernization to cloud, BI modernization and the Open Stacks, among others, in addition to all our present disclosures. Looking deeper into the numbers, we can see that our strategy to help clients drive automation and innovation into the core of their businesses through our renewed and new services, software and offerings and our culture of learning and education is the right one.", "Let me speak about the renewal of our core services and the delivery of new services. In Q4, we helped clients make digital cloud data and analytics and mainframe modernization a reality. And while we continue to strengthen and renew our core services, it is important to note that new services revenue continued to gain strong traction. We also continued to drive grassroots innovation through Zero Distance. In March, we celebrated 2 years of Zero Distance and the implementation of more than 2,000 innovation ideas. Among these were key engagements with many clients, Aon, Affinity and many others. As Zero Distance evolves, we have also focused on converting the best ideas into business solutions and intellectual properties that will help us drive new opportunities across industry segments.", "In digital, cloud, legacy modernization and automation, we strengthened our strategic partnership with Adobe, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and salesforce.com. And in engineering services through our partnership with GE, we deliver solutions in the field of automation, digital trends and Internet of Things among others. We partnered with Cisco, Hitachi Data Systems, ServiceNow, BMC, Virtustream, HB Enterprise and Huawei and others to modernize plant infrastructures to bring them the cloud efficiencies. In Agile and DevOps, we helped several large clients transform their IT organizations enabled by our services, including our Infosys developer platform and our tooling and architecture expertise.", "Internally, we leverage our own automation solutions and though we estimate that we saved more than 3,800 FTEs worth of effort sales in Q4, primarily in application maintenance, packet system maintenance, BPO and infrastructure management, bringing the total FTEs worth of effort sales in FY \u201817 to more than 11,600. Through Zero Bench, which is our program to engage employees in value creation while between projects, more than 20,500 web packets were completed in FY \u201817. And with this, we continue to re-imagine the very notion of the bench.", "In Q4, when it comes to new software-led offerings, we saw continued strong momentum in Mana, Skava, Panaya and Edge. Mana had its best quarter ever in terms of wins. In Q4, we won 27 Mana engagements, including Etienne, to help them in creating their digital ecosystem. This brings total Mana customers to 50 plus and the total number of engagements in Mana to more than 150. Mana has more than doubled every quarter in the last four quarters of its existence. Skava continued to grow its customer base in Q4, including winning an engagement with EMEA for their next generation rewards management and Design Thinking was a core part of this engagement.", "Overall, in FY \u201817, Skava grew its customer base by more than 40%. EdgeVerve delivered a strong performance with 30 wins and 26 go-lives from both Finacle and Edge. And at this stage, our flagship RPA platform continues to drive this growth. And Panaya had its best year, finishing the year very strong. In the second half of 2017, we appointed a new leadership team, under the leadership of Jay Klein, to go after higher value opportunities. There are several strong examples of customer success with our new software-led offerings that we have included in our press release that went out earlier today.", "When it comes to investment and ecosystem, we continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities and our AI platform, Mana. And this quarter, we added significant expertise by acquiring a highly accomplished team of machine learning experts on Skytree, one of the early startups focused on speeding up and scaling machine learning. Skytree\u2019s Founder and CEO, Professor Alexander Gray from Georgia Tech did some early pioneering work on massive scientific datasets and machine learning from those at NASA. Sanjay Mehta, Skytree\u2019s Head of Engineering and an IIT Mumbai alumnus, brings two decades of experience delivering highly scalable on-premise and cloud enterprise systems, and I am really excited about the tremendous potential of our joint teams.", "In addition, through our $500 million U.S. dollar innovation fund, we continued to support startups that extend the innovation that we bring to our clients. We made seven new investments, including Unsilo, an AI company, ideaForge, a pioneer in autonomous unmanned vehicles and Trifacta, which enables lines of business to gain insight from growing volumes of raw data. We initially entitled scale supporting their groundbreaking technology and the work diverse virtualization to reduce hardware costs for large-scale information processing. We invested in Cloudyn, which helps clients understand the cost performance benefits of moving work loads to public cloud. And lastly, we continued to invest with limited partners, selecting Stellaris Venture Partners to help us gain exposure to innovative new companies in India that we can help bring into other markets.", "With regard to culture, in FY \u201817, we introduced our RSU Plan for the top performers and high potential employees, covering approximately 25% of mid to senior employees that is more than 8,300 employees. In addition, we restructured the compensation of senior leaders to be more performance based with a significant portion of their compensation now coming through stock incentives. I am personally proud of new RSU and performance based plans as I believe any world class organization must be performance driven and enables employees to be entrepreneurial and share in the successes of the company. I believe this entrepreneurialism and innovation is fundamental to our success in the times ahead.", "In education and training, Design Thinking training now covers more than 135,000 employees across the organization. Beyond this, we are brining new immersive learning to AI training. We have now trained more than 2,000 people on machine learning and on our Mana platform, leveraging books to deliver new courses at scale, introducing a new class for power programmers using the flight simulator model of experiential learnings and expanding learning to the Digital Tutor\u2019s social learning platform and the Infosys learning platform.", "Looking beyond business, in Q4 the Infosys Foundation committed to the construction of sanitation facilities at government schools and training centers in Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka and partnered with The Akshay Patra Foundation to provide sanitation kits and counseling for 1 year to 20,000 girls attending school in Jaipur. An announcement from the foundation to Sri Ramakrishna Sevashrama this quarter had provided drinking water and fodder to remote villages in and around Pavagada, Karnataka. The Infosys Science Foundation, ISF, honored six top researchers across the world in science and humanities with the Infosys Prize 2016, celebrating their inspiring contribution to science and to research in the public good. The Infosys Foundation USA announced new data training grants for Bootstrap, Exploring Computer Science, UTeach, Beauty and Joy of Computing, and Mobile CS Principles, enabling 500 public school educators nationwide to attend free high quality computer science professional development in the U.S. Including the earlier commitments to Code.org and DonorsChoose.org, the 1,000 educators supported in summer of 2017 will double the number of teachers that we helped in 2016 and bring computer science education to tens of thousands of new students. In addition, the Foundation will continue to support Hispanic Heritage Foundation and its summer 2017 LOFT Coder Summit at Stanford University.", "Coming to outlook \u2013 coming to the business outlook for FY \u201918, based on what we see presently, we are guiding for a constant currency revenue growth of 6.5% to 8.5%. This takes into account a normal seasonality of stronger performance in the first half of the fiscal year. Our margin outlook for FY \u201818 is for operating margins to be in the range of 23% to 25%. The FX considered include recent rupee appreciation and expanding capacity in on-site development centers to mitigate any potential risks from visa regulation in the U.S. as well as the necessary investments in new services and new software product [ph] releases. We will continue our relentless focus on cost optimization as we have done this past year and accelerate automation and innovation and mitigating the impact on margins. In closing, we remain steadfast and passionate in our longer term path to transform Infosys and to continue \u2013 and we continue to see many positive signs that our strategy is the right one.", "I will now hand it over to Ranganath for his comments on the financials. Thank you.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you, Vishal. Hello everyone. Let me start with the key outcomes for the financial year 2017. Our revenues grew 7.4% in USD terms and 8.3% in constant currency. Coming to operating margins, we had indicated that the operating margin guidance for the year to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Our operating margin for fiscal \u201817 is closer to higher end of the guidance range at 24.7%. Operating margin for the year was steady despite the pricing decline, currency volatility during the year on account of Brexit and the U.S. elections and lower revenue growth trajectory during the year. This was primarily an account of a sharp focus on operational efficiency parameters like utilization, on-site employee costs as a percentage of revenues, subcontractor costs as a percentage of revenues.", "Let\u2019s look at each of these items and see how they moved during the year, to utilization. Last year, we exited Q4 with utilization of 80.1% and ended the current Q4 at 82%, an increase of almost 2%. Likewise for fiscal \u201817, utilization was 81.7% compared to 80.6% for our fiscal \u201816. Coming to on-site employee costs as percentage of revenues, it reduced to 38.1% in Q4 this year from 38.6% last year, which is a drop of 0.5%. For full year fiscal \u201817, total employee costs as a percentage of revenues was held steady at 54.7%, despite the compensation increases. Subcontractor expenses as a percent of revenues was held steady at 5.6% revenue for the full year.", "Let us now move to the second key outcome of fiscal \u201817, which is a robust cash generation. For fiscal \u201817, cash provided from operating activities as per consolidated IFRS, grossed $2 billion for the first time ever at $2.099 billion, an increase of 13% over last year. Likewise, free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditure, increased by 16% to $16.88 million. Looking at our cash conversion, operating cash as a percentage of net profits improved to 98% as compared to 91% in the previous year due to strong cash generation, cash and cash equivalents, including investments to that a record high of $5.979 million. Coming to capital allocation policy, the Board has approved a revised capital allocation policy, keeping in view the strategic and operational cash needs of the company in the medium-term as well as enhancing the returns to our shareholders. The details have been announced in the results press release, further announcements in this regard will be made as appropriate in due course.", "Volume growth for fiscal \u201817 was 10.2%. For the full year, the realization declined by 1.9% in constant currency terms and 2.7% in reported terms. Our net employee addition in fiscal \u201817 is 6,320, which is significantly lower than the 17,857 last year. This is reflected in the improvement in the revenue per employee in fiscal \u201817 to $51,375. Basic EPS for the full year was $0.94 compared to $0.90 in fiscal \u201816, which is a growth of 4.3%. Coming to Q4, our revenues in dollar terms were up by 0.7% sequentially in reported terms and flat in constant currency. On a year-on-year basis, revenues grew 5% in reported terms and 5.3% in constant currency.", "Our operating margins for the quarter was 24.7%, a decrease of 40 basis points over Q3 \u201817. During the quarter, rupee appreciated by 1.4% against U.S. dollar, which impacted the margins by approximately 35 basis points. There was a positive impact of 50 basis points in account of cross-currency and revenue hedges. This was offset by an approximate 55 basis points impact from a decrease in realization and an increase in other costs, leading to an overall 40 basis points on \u2013 decline in operating margins during the quarter. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $547 million, flat at Q3 levels. Free cash flow during the quarter was $443 million. This was despite tax payments of about $45 million that was paid pursuant to demand from tax authorities in India.", "DSO for the quarter improved to 68 days compared to 69 days in Q3 \u201817. Our hedge position as of March 31, 2017 was $1,350 million. We are guiding for a constant currency growth of 6.5% to 8.5% for fiscal \u201818. On operating margins, we expect our fiscal \u201818 operating margins in the band of 23% to 25%. In fiscal \u201818, apart from the rupee appreciation that we have seen, we also expect ramping up of onsite development center in the United States to address potential visa regulation changes. However, at the same time, as we have done this year, we will relentlessly focus on implementing operational efficiency parameters, especially on higher offshoring, roll mix optimization onsite and benefits from automation to minimize the impact on operating margins.", "As you know, several regulatory proposals are under consideration in the United States that in this size changes to visa regime. At this point in time, there is no clarity on what proposal and what form will be finalized. So, our margin band for fiscal \u201818 doesn\u2019t include potential impact on these aspects. As in every financial year, Q1 would see compensation increases and these are costs which we expect to play out in this quarter as well \u2013 in this Q1 as well.", "With that, we will open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Yes, thanks guys. Just going back to the topic of margins and that\u2019s been probably the most frequently discussed topics since last night by investors. This is another kind of margin reset delay kind of the market sees it here. One, appreciate some of the data in terms of what drives the lower end of the range to 23%. Is there anyway to kind of quantify specifically how much incremental recruiting domestically will impact margins in fiscal year 2018? Maybe also talk about the investments? Is there also a factor on the pricing compression that you are seeing in the legacy business? Any color here will be useful just because of the fact that people are worried that this is not the last reset on the margin side? Thanks.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you. Ranga here. So, if you look at just before I answered that question, I also want to provide some color on the operation margin trajectory during this current year and what were some of the things that played out and how we addressed and why we are kind of expanding the margin range, right. If you look at earlier this year, we expect a margin guidance of 24% to 25%. And we ended up at the higher end of the guidance range at 24.7% and this was despite almost 5% reduction in revenue trajectory as compared to previous year. If you recollect in fiscal \u201815, our constant currency revenue growth was 13.4%. And this year, it is 8.4%, almost 5%. But despite that, we are able to hold the operating margins steady at 24.7% primarily because we focused a lot an operational on efficiency measures that I outlined like utilization onsite and employee costs and so on.", "We do believe that some of those levers do exist with us today. For example, onsite effort mix, which is close to 30% and we have seen earlier in recent years at 27%. Every 1% reduction in onsite gives us operating margin benefit of 40 basis points. So these are some of the areas we will focus on further in this year. Likewise, if you look at the onsite employee cost, one of the other measures we have deployed in these quarters is really to look at roll mixing fixed space projects. So that\u2019s how despite the revenue, lower revenue trajectory and other compensation in prices last year, we were able to hold the margin steady last year. Now, the reason for expansion this year while we will continue as I said earlier our relentless focus on the operational parameters which we still have levers especially onsite. One is the rupee appreciation. If you look at last 2 weeks almost, if you compare with the FY \u201817 average to year end closing, rupee has appreciated about 3.3%. So that is something we need to watch out. Of course, even last year, we had huge currency fluctuations on account of Brexit and U.S. pound and euro with the U.S. dollars. We navigated that successfully. However, I think we want to kind of keep in view the trajectory of rupee and see how we navigate.", "The second part, as I mentioned earlier, is also we are proactively making certain investments in the United States, especially opening certain local development centers to ensure proximity to clients, at the same time, ability to attract local hires. One of the key reasons why many of the local hires were really \u2013 we are not able to attract apart from many other reasons is the location certainty. For example, we expect our employees otherwise, come on these are there to move from one location to another as and when the projects get completed, which doesn\u2019t give location certainty for the local hires. So, there is [indiscernible] to join us, because they want to be in a particular location. So, we have been developing these development centers in client clusters. Today, we have high concentration of clients, so that local hires could join us, be in the development center and ability to work across projects in that cluster. So, we believe that this will help us in attraction. So, there are couple of operating costs which are \u2013 which we do believe is one-time, which is essentially in that increasing attractiveness for local hiring. And we have made some progress during the \u2013 in fact, some of the investments started as early as previous quarters. We have had those hirings and they are deploying. So, we are proactively addressing that aspect. So typically, these two are the key aspects.", "Coming to the other question and part of the question that you have is it because of the pricing decline. Even last year, if you look at the pricing decline was about 1.9% in constant currency, but despite that, we were able to offset that through operational efficiency measures and hold the margin steady. I think this additional aspect that we want to look on how do we want to mitigate any potential margin impact is also on automation. One uptick that we saw which is probably what you are noting is this year, the net headcount addition into the group was about 60% lower than last year\u2019s. We added just about little less than 6,000 employees as compared to close to 18,000 employees last year. I mean, essentially, we want to see whether this could accelerate during the year by way of automation and productivity and how much that could really provide us some positive impact. So net-net, I think the expansion of margin range, 22% to 25%, while we will continue to focus on operational efficiencies, primarily from proactive investments, one-time investments were made. We plan to make during the course of the year gradually as the last [indiscernible].", "Moshe Katri", "Great. Just a follow-up. That\u2019s the other question that people are asking. Do you think, and this is for Pravin, do you think it\u2019s too early or premature to call the spending recovery in the financial services vertical or this is something that we have been focusing on since the end of last year and post the election in the U.S.? Thanks.", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes, hi, this is Mohit Joshi. I think look, that\u2019s a very valid question. The way we look at it and this is a very U.S. specific issue. The way we look at it is that the sentiment has certainly improved. There is a lot more optimism because of that 8 cards and because of the expectations of an easier regulated regime. And we expected fully to flow-through into IT budgets. We haven\u2019t seen that yet, but the pace of the cuts certainly seemed to be a lot less furious that a year ago and expect that over the next few months. It should start going into spend. Does that answer your question?", "Moshe Katri", "That did. Is that embedded in your guidance at this point?", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes. So the guidance obviously reflects the situation as we see it now, so yes.", "Moshe Katri", "Alright. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Yes. Thanks for taking the question here. So the DeepDive/Everest Group Forecaster has called for the top five Indian firms to grow 6.3% in organic constant currency over the next 12 months. I am looking at the midpoint of your fiscal \u201818 guidance at 7.5% in constant currency. If you assume that you might generate around 1 point of growth from acquisitions over the next year, your guidance is actually right in line with our market forecast. So the question I have is when you formulated your fiscal \u201818 guidance, did you assume that Infosys would be a share gainer or a share maintainer or perhaps even a share loser depending on your market forecast, our forecast implies that you are essentially pounding on show maintenance over the next year, but I would love to get your take on how you see your growth outlooks stacking up against what you are seeing for the overall market, particularly for the top five Indian firms?", "M. D. Ranganath", "I think let me address that particular point. See, just to step back, if you look at the last two fiscal years. If you look at fiscal \u201816 or fiscal \u201817, if you exclude last two before that, our relative share, if you look at the \u2013 if you compare with the NASSCOM guidance in India or our large peers, we used to grow about 50% of what NASSCOM indicated are 50% of our large peers. That used to be till fiscal \u201814 and \u201815. Last 2 years, our endeavor has been to bridge the underperformance of the company vis-\u00e0-vis the NASSCOM guidance, vis-\u00e0-vis the large peers. If you look at last 2 years, you are pretty much in line with the industry. And in fact fiscal \u201816 probably we were slightly ahead of the industry growth both NASSCOM as well as the peers. And even fiscal \u201818 based on what we see, what we\u2019ve announced and expectations from guidance in NASSCOM as well as the large peers in fiscal \u201817, also our growth has been in line with the industry. So last 2 years, the relative underperformance of the company, vis-\u00e0-vis the industry growth rate, whether it was NASSCOM or other large peers have been arrested. This year NASSCOM has kind of shied away to give guidance at the beginning of the year. So I think what they have stated is that they will watch the Q1 performance of all the large players and will give their guidance post Q1, I think that is the statement they have taken. As far as our guidance, is primarily driven by the bottom-up approach, for example, from our existing clients, the market share, the penetration that we see from the large deal wins that have happened in the earlier quarters what is the ramp up that we see as well as new Saudi project starts that are likely to happen during the course of this quarter and coming quarter. So it\u2019s a combination of grounds up. So in summary, last 2 years I think our growth rate has been in line with the industry in fiscal \u201815 and slightly ahead of the industry. But this year, we have taken a primarily bottom-up approach.", "Vishal Sikka", "Yes. And hey Ron, this is Vishal. Just to add to Ranganath\u2019s points. If you look at our business, it is \u2013 to answer your question a little bit more thoughtfully I want to look at it from two different points of view. One is the nature of our business and the other one is the nature of what\u2019s going on at clients. If you look at our business, we have basically around 1,000 clients and a relatively small number, 250 of them accounts for a vast majority of our revenue. And if you look at the other companies in our state, it is more or less the same kind of a situation. Basically, everybody is around 1,000, 1,200, 900 clients, something like this. So therefore, even if you look at the top 10,000 businesses in the world, our penetration relative to this is relatively small. And so there is a vast open field of opportunities for us to go and so share gains relative to others is the way I see it is a relatively smaller part of the overall equation and a lot more of the growth is to be achieved by being relevant to clients, especially in areas that are new and that are strategic and deeply relevant to the clients\u2019 futures. If we do that, I think the vast majority of the growth would come from new areas and not as shares at the expense of others in the industry, but really as business wins directly with clients and unprecedented new areas. The other part of it is that the software business that we have, which is still a small part of our business, but growing very rapidly, applies to much larger client base than our traditional go-to-market services. And in this world, we expect to grow significantly over the course of this year. And this part of the business is not \u2013 does not have the same kind of seasonal headwinds in the second half of the year that the services business does. So the applicability of this is to several thousands, potentially a few tens of thousands of customers. And so over the course of the year under Pervinder\u2019s eadership, our endeavor is going to be build \u2013 build a go to market motions and channels to this larger client base for our software. So it is a multi-faceted situation that we see. And the way I look at this, rather than look at it from the way industry is moving and so forth, I look at this as our ability to engage with clients in the areas of their strategic relevance, our ability to build differentiated offerings and our ability to build a new channel into the new parts of the markets that are relevant for our software world. I hope that\u2026", "Rod Bourgeois", "Yes, that helps. In the way of follow-up, can you just give us your views on two growth drivers, one would be new bookings, so not renewals, but the outlook for booking new contracts with new scope. And then also your assumption for fiscal \u201818 on pricing, given that it was down last year, do you expect it to be down again in fiscal \u201818?", "Vishal Sikka", "Ron, we don\u2019t generally breakdown the new in services bookings, vis-\u00e0-vis the renewed \u2013 renewals. But in large deals, we report this on a quarterly basis. But we generally don\u2019t break it down. We will talk this through and see if we have one of the upcoming analyst meetings isn\u2019t something that we can provide a more color on to you guys.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Okay. And then on the pricing front?", "Vishal Sikka", "The pricing, we have seen it relatively stable. Certainly, on the diamond material side, it has been pretty stable. And I think we \u2013 Ranganath, did have some commentary on that in the \u2013 relatively stable so far and that\u2019s somewhat we see.", "Rod Bourgeois", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. I just want to make sure I got this right, so what accelerates your growth rate from these levels, is it the new areas, software and the new initiatives, is there an opportunity to get back to I guess low-teens and I think you might have said something about breaking out the new versus older services as a percentage of revenue going forward, can we get a preview on that?", "Vishal Sikka", "So Joe, maybe I can speak at a high level. If you look at our business, roughly 65% of our workforce produces about 55% of our revenue at roughly $48,000 RPP. This is \u2013 this part of the business is the one that is more commoditizing. This is the part which is around maintenance and operate areas of business like that. Here, the growth rates are not so strong and the margin pressure is quite high. We have had volume growth outperform revenue growth so far. And in this part of the business, our endeavor is to bring an extreme focus on automation to bring differentiated offerings vis-\u00e0-vis moving to new cloud infrastructures and things like this. And nearly differentiate on the business of delivering much higher productivity and efficiency improvements to our clients, optimizing parameters like to roll ratios and on-site mix and so forth. The other part of our business is where 35% of our workforce produces 45% of our revenue. This happens at $72,000 RPP. And here, the growth rate in the past year has been close to 20%. The growth rates are very high. The margins are higher than the margins for the industry. And if you look at software as well as a part of this I mentioned earlier, software is growing at 43% year-on-year, the new software. This is part that we wish to double down on, develop our sales competencies, go-to-market competencies and really push hard as well as bringing a real innovation to that design thinking engagements, really engaging on strategic fronts bringing software into the mix and so forth. So, it is really a two-pronged strategy, a portfolio-oriented strategy. Of course, some parts of our business I have talked about consulting before and cynical BPO. BPO has had very good performance both on growth as well as on margins over the last 9 months. And so we are happy about where this is headed. We want to bring some more transformational capabilities to BPO, something with the leadership we are looking forward to a double-digit growth a year ahead of us. And consulting has been I guess the polite thing to say what is the word, headwind. And really, I mean, starting from Q1, it has been something that has, in particular pockets of some parts of our consulting, which are somewhat backwards looking is something that Rajesh took over consulting about 9 months ago has really been focusing on reshaping this in a very purposeful kind of a way. So, that is really the three distinct parts of our portfolio, really the growth emerging next generation new parts which we want to really push a little hard on the more commoditizing parts of our services which we want to bring as much automation and Mana-led efficiencies as possible and then the businesses that we want to turn around. Ravi, you want to add anything to this?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes. So the growth portfolios, as Vishal spoke about it in the new services are primarily the ones which customers are significantly spending to transform their own landscapes. So either you would potentially use the services to renew an existing landscape or you would bolster an existing landscape with the level of modernization to leverage the power of new technologies. So, it could be either say \u2013 I will illustrate a few examples. It could be a mainframe modernization program to move customers out of the mainframe to very agile newer landscapes. It could be cybersecurity to bolster an existing infrastructure and network, which can make it very safe. It could be digital technologies to transform and innovate their business process. So, the kind of span across these high spend areas, very little talent available in the market so you will have to build teams organically and hire people with deep expertise, huge headroom. And therefore, the growth rates are very high. The faster you could actually take it up and invest in them and be a part of the client journeys, there would be significant spend and hence you could realize the value out of it.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. So just so I understand, 45% of your business is growing about 20%. And then 55%, which includes consulting headwinds, right, is probably declining at a specific rate because that will get you to your overall growth rate. Is that fair?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes. So, the balance, which is the commoditized business, while it is not growing in revenues it would continue to grow in volumes and that\u2019s because there is a heavy commoditization, which essentially means you would have to take cost out. You would have to make it very agile and invest into new areas. It will feed into the new areas. We still need to be in that business. We need to be in that business, because it is an estate you want to own so that you get the rights to actually invest into the new areas. And then as a firm, we have to have the duality of taking cost out in those commoditized areas and investing into new areas and make the growth happen from the newer areas and take people out, refactor the talent and push them into new areas and use software and automation to allow the state to be maintained by us. So, it\u2019s kind of a dual strategy to go ahead. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one against the other. We have to just do both.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. Okay. And is there an FTE or cost takeout target for FY \u201818 how should we think about your progress there?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Are you talking about the automation led takeouts or the broader ones?", "Joseph Foresi", "Yes. I think you had talked about maybe 11,000 in total in FY \u201817 roughly and I am wondering, is there any targets that you have set internally that you could share with us for FY \u201818 on headcount reduction through automation?", "Vishal Sikka", "Joe, so far, we have been reporting this FTE number, which is \u2013 because the FTEs that we released got assigned to other projects are moved to other sometimes \u2013 other service lines or upscaled themselves to higher order services and so forth. This is really not a very good proxy for automation. As we get really serious about bringing automation in a massive way into our \u2013 the numbers, of course, I mentioned 11,300 plus number or something like this over the course of the last 12 months is actually a very significant number, which means that the impact is happening and you see that in the revenue per employee improvement. You see that in the fact that the revenue growth has significantly outpaced employee additions. So, it is working. But now, we really need to take this to a whole different level and that is going to be the end over the course of this year. So, do we have any goals for it? Mike will also say is that the agile minimum viable way of working under the initiatives is to not have artificial goals that constrain our thinking. The only goal really is 100%. We want automation to come to 100% of our projects, 100% of our fixed price projects, 100% of our large client engagements where we have a meaningful chunk of the business process or the application landscape that we can transform by virtue of automation. I mentioned earlier 50 plus Mana engagements. Of these, something like maybe Sandeep, correct me if I am wrong. 28 are in the Mana for IT area, where we are already doing IT work together with Mana. So obviously here, and Mana, becomes the system which helps automate the operation of the systems and there are number of people is quite smaller that work on the Mana platform. And the other ones are in the new areas of Mana which is in a different category, the Mana for business, where you built breakthrough in applications. But coming back automation, so really our goal is to launch a massive campaign, a top-down one starting with our big account engagements and the fixed price projects and the bottom up one, which is a particular instance of our Zero Distance campaigns to really bring automation basically into 100% of that 45% of our workforce \u2013 sorry, 45% of our \u2013 65% of our workforce, which produces 55% of our revenue, which is amenable to automation. That is the endeavor and I look forward to updating you guys on how we progress on that front.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And last quick one for me, can you give us any color how big Mana is and who you are competing with in that product? Thanks.", "Vishal Sikka", "It is one-of-a-kind, man. Everyone [indiscernible] platform these days and from the times that I studied, I, as a student to now, it is a very \u2013 everyone calls there, toolkits, AI platforms and there is a tremendous amount of excitement in the world of AI these days. Everyday, there is some breakthrough or the other that is delivered the kids at open AI, which is a open consortium in the world of AI. There is really extraordinary work last week in really new frontiers and on supervised learning. We had an amazing example at a bank here in Asia where we built a Mana-based solution to process NDAs, non-disclosure agreements for this bank. And they had a small team of lawyers, I think between 10 and 15 junior lawyers that used to process these NDAs. And with Mana, we can automatically process them. We learnt these in [indiscernible] network and to figure out if there are modifications through the NDAs, if those modifications are acceptable or not. And we do all of that automatically and completely eliminate that portion of the work done by these team of lawyers. I mean, this is not administrators, file system admins or operators of standard operating procedures, some things like this. This is lawyers that we are talking about. So, it\u2019s really an exciting field. And I mentioned that we acquired this team of 8 PhDs from Skytree under the leadership of Sudhir. And we like to think that \u2013 I mean, if you look at the IDC report that just come out on Mana or Forrester report or HfS report that will give you some more insights on how it is doing compared to the others. But beyond that, I like to think that it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind platform.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi. I just wanted to start with a housekeeping question, Vishal. I want to make sure I heard you are right with regard to the first half, second half seasonality. We are talking kind of quickly here?", "Vishal Sikka", "The \u2013 let me mention exactly what I said. What I said was this takes into account the normal seasonality of a stronger performance in the first half of the fiscal year. We have chosen these words carefully and perhaps Ranga can add to whatever I have to say here. I want to say is that if you look at the traditional services business and if you look at our performance over the last many years, the first half of the year tends to have stronger performance than the second half of the year and that pattern we have factored in as we learned about our guidance experience over the last few quarters as we look at the 6.5% to 8.5%. Having said that, the software business obviously is immune from the seasonality and the software \u2013 as the software business becomes bigger, we expect that more of this as we transform the softer business towards the bookings oriented and subscription oriented business, we expect that more of this will happen towards the second half of the year. And as we get more visibility we will change that and [indiscernible] new services on a steep ramp up. And again, that we expect will still have an impact again as time goes forward and so forth. But the statement I made was that the guidance that we have provided today takes into account the normal seasonality of the stronger performance in the first half of the fiscal year. Does that make sense?", "James Friedman", "Yes. Thank you for repeating that. And then just my follow-up, I understand you gave commentary about your anticipation on financial services are any of the other verticals contemplated to either decelerate or accelerate this fiscal?", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes. Hi, this is Mohit. So let me just reiterate on the [indiscernible] financial services. As you have seen in the current year, right, so for the current quarter we grew on a reported basis by 1.4%. But actually if you exclude [indiscernible] the growth in the services was 2%. If you look at the entire year, the growth is double digit, we should believe is very strong, right, I mean compared to what was expected with the start of the year and compared to where our peers are landing up. I think we remain optimistic about financial services for the next 12 months as well. I think our story about renew and new about automation and AI, but also of our Design Thinking and digital is really resonating well by clients. So brief perspective that we have on financial services. As I mentioned, in the U.S., we see a lot of optimism and we expect it to convert into higher IT spends. Our European business in any case has been extremely strong for the past 2 years or 3 years. And despite the fact that the banks they are slightly less optimistic than U.S. based banks, we have a lot of headroom for growth. The banks in Europe are still behind the curve in terms of technology adoption. So that gives us a lot of room to sell our existing and our new stack of services. And we have a very healthy business in the rest of the world, including in Australia. So that\u2019s just a quick really more of a geographic rather than a sub-vertical snapshot, but hopefully it gives you a perspective.", "James Friedman", "Okay. Thank you for taking my questions Mohit and Vishal. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi. Thank you very much. I am going to throw in two questions or ask two questions if I could. The first is on the margins, is that something I was hoping you could clarify, because I also didn\u2019t catch you quite, but it sounded like you said each 100 basis points shift on-site negatively impacts margins by roughly 40 basis points if I heard that correctly, but the longer term view is why wouldn\u2019t that persist and what I mean by that is you trying to go increase your digital content, which I think is more onshore labor than offshore and the visas may or may not play out, but it would seem that you are trying to position more onshore labor in response to that, so if you could just clarify, A, that I hear that correctly and B, why wouldn\u2019t that be a longer term issue that would thereby put pressure on margins over sustained periods of time?", "Vishal Sikka", "Hi Keith, this is Vishal. Maybe I can start and then Ravi can add to this. If you look at the overall situation with the workforce, there are three distinct forces at play here when you think about onsite and availability of talent and skill. One is the fact that as you said, the newer services, digital and so forth require more up-close distance, hands-on engagement, local talent and things like this. The other one is that we have a huge amount of talent present in the larger volume of services that I mentioned earlier, 65% of the workforce producing 55% of our revenue. And in that part, we can significantly optimize the onsite mix and bring much more automation to bear and free up more capacity onsite. And the third dimension is the visa dimension where we need to hire locals anyway, so we believe that one of the things that Ravi has been working on is a very \u2013 it\u2019s a not a straightforward thing, but a very well thought through plan to optimize along these three dimensions to make sure that we are really maximizing the on-site mix when it comes to \u2013 maximally optimizing the onsite mix. When it comes to the commoditizing services, we are rowing without compromise because of the higher value offsetting the onsite costs when it comes to the new services. And taking advantage of the fact that because of the visa related matters we have to get more local hiring than any way to ensure that that is done in a very purposeful and carefully thought through a locally. Ravi?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "To add on to what Vishal said, one is exactly like Vishal said, which is the digital and renewed services come at a substantially higher margin than these traditional services, so onsite is in fact more profitable. And from the incremental growth that we see is beneficial to having those services on-site. Coming back to the other part, the second part of the business segment, what I was referring to was really one of the fixed price projects, right. We undertake a lot of fixed price projects onsite. By reducing the days of course, the revenue is very much fixed and we have more flexibility in off-shoring as well as changing the rule mix in that fixed price project. So that\u2019s what we are zeroing in on. So I hope that clarifies.", "Keith Bachman", "It does. I will ask my \u2013 thank you very much for that response. I will ask my second question and then I will see the floor. Vishal, have you seen any evidence there is I would suggest or submit that there is a lot of confusion, at least that we pick up on what the HB1 issues may or may not mean, have you seen any evidence of customers that are a minimum pausing before they will execute contracts with an Indian providers or any delays, any characterization that you could give in response to the uncertainty on the H-1B issues? And that\u2019s it for me. Thanks very much gentlemen.", "Vishal Sikka", "Yes. I think it is too early. There is nothing material so far. There is a lot of curiosity, a lot of interest and a lot of clients want to know what\u2019s going with the whole H-1B situation. They want to know, I mean they are not obviously \u2013 because of the fee working with companies like ours is not just about outsourcing or taking costs out and the stuff like that. But it was about really bringing capabilities and innovation that no one else can bring. And so there is no rethinking of that. It is simply that, for example, if there are workers that would be impacted by the clients would think about ways of ensuring that their workers \u2013 the way you structure the contracts and so forth take into account all of that and so forth. But so far, I have not seen anything material. And so proactively, we are building our approach in our plans and but as President have something to add to this, do you guys want to add anything to this?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "No.", "Vishal Sikka", "I guess they don\u2019t.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I would now like to hand over the floor to Sandeep Mahindroo for closing comments. Over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks everyone, for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf Infosys Limited, that concludes this conference call.

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Hello, everyone and welcome to Infosys earnings call to discuss Q1 FY18 results. This is Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining us today on this earnings call is CEO and MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka; COO, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath, President and the other members of the senior management team.", "We will start the call with some remarks on the performance of the Company by Dr. Sikka and Mr. Ranganath. Subsequent to which we will open up the call for questions. Please note that anything which we say which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the Company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Dr. Sikka.", "Vishal Sikka", "Thanks, Sandeep. Hey, everyone and thanks for joining. I\u2019m really proud of our achievements in Q1. It was the passion focused on execution of our management team, and indeed every Infoscion to steadfastly execute and to continue on our path to transformation.", "We\u2019re deeply convinced of the differentiated value that we can deliver to clients, helping them leverage the power of artificial intelligence and Design Thinking to reimagine their businesses. And we can do this to our learn ability, our culture of innovation, in which every Infoscion is empowered to be a proactive problem finder.", "During the previous earnings call, I had emphasized our relentless focus on our commitment to execution in Q1. We did this and this is reflected in the all round performance in Q1. Solid constant currency revenue growth, resilient margins despite multiple headwinds, record cash generation, improvement in utilization to record levels, revenue per -- revenue productivity per person and uptick in revenue per FTE. Ranga will provide more color on these shortly.", "In Q1, our revenues grew sequentially by 3.2% on reported dollar basis and 2.7% on constant currency basis. Growth was distributed between both volumes and utilization with volumes growing by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter and utilization growing 1.8% quarter-on-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew by 6% on reported dollar basis and 6.3% on constant currency basis. INR revenues declined by 0.2% sequentially due to rupee appreciation and increased by 1.8% on a year-on-year basis.", "Our utilization excluding trainees were up 84%, which is the highest level in 15 years and including trainees utilization was 80.2%, which is the highest level ever. I\u2019m happy to share that driven by our improved performance compared to the last few quarters, we are paying higher variable pay to our employees this quarter. Consistent with recent quarters, the percentage payout will be higher at lower levels and lower at senior management and leadership levels. Within each level we will continue to strive towards higher performance differentiation through different payout levels.", "Our attrition was up 16.9% on a standalone basis as compared to 15.8% in Q1 last year, and 13.5% in Q4 last year, owing to Q1 seasonality when employees leave to pursue higher studies. We had broad based growth across verticals and geographies, including financial services and insurance, retail and CPG, and our ECS vertical.", "On financial services, our growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year as the impact of increased interest rates and lower regulatory pressures in the U.S. start to reflect in our client spending.", "Consistent with our commentary on the last quarter on higher disclosures, this quarter we have disclosed revenues from new services and software that we started since the 1st of April 2015. 8.3% of our quarter Q1 revenues came from new services, in the cloud first, AI first digital experience service area that are strategic to our clients and that were launched in the past two years. Similarly 1.6% of our Q1 revenues came from new software that started since the 1st of April 2015 comprising of Edge, Nia, our next-generation AI platform, Panaya and Skava.", "In management, we also welcomed Inderpreet Sawhney to Infosys as our new General Counsel. Inderpreet brings to Infosys a wealth of critical experience in large complex global firms, as well as small innovative one from India to Silicon Valley, to help us become a much more global agile organization, while upholding the highest standards of integrity and governance.", "And finally we announced plans to hire 10,000 American workers over the next two years and established four renovation hubs, with the first two in Indiana and North Carolina where we will hire 2,000 people each in the next few years. In Q1, 600 plus U.S workers have already been hired. This is a continuation of plans that we launched in 2014, starting with 2,000 American hires to get closer to the clients, deliver new high touch, high-value services, leverage the best local and global talent, and build the next generation of innovators through world-class education and training.", "Now let me share some specifics of our strategy execution. In the new traditional services, in Q1 through our Zero Distance program, we delivered grassroots innovation, leveraging Design Thinking, and to date more than 16,500 ideas have been generated from our project teams and more than 2,200 of these have already been implemented with clients, including Myers, My picker App in Australia, for fulfilling retail orders with more efficiency and better user experience.", "We're now evolving to Zero Distance [indiscernible] with a focus on themes and solution. From the 16,500 ideas, the teams have synthesized 75 plus themes in areas like insurance claims adjudication, digital farming, cyber security and others with the potential for reuse, conversion into packet business solutions or an IP creation. Zero Distance is at the heart of transforming at a grassroots level, our efforts towards innovation and automation.", "We continue to drive automation into our service clients, saving more than 3,500 FTEs worth of effort in Q1. Beyond saving FTEs, we have seen radical use cases of Nia within our services. Nia is being used for large scale transformation within our AMS services, as well as to drive cost savings in managed projects.", "Our Zero Bench program continues to thrive with 42,000 work records already created and 24,000 work records completed by the end of Q1, and it is one of the key reason that threshold utilization has gone up significantly.", "Coming to new digital services, we continue to build out our new higher growth, higher margin, higher ARPU services, which are exactly in line with clients most important business needs and we are seeing strong traction in these. Cyber Security, for example, is one of our fastest growing new services, given the heightened awareness at the CXO level due to a recent incident.", "Coming to new software led offerings, in Q1, we saw continued momentum in Nia, Skava, Edge and Panaya. We launched Nia in April, building on and accelerating our work over in the last 2.5 years with our first junction AI platform with IAP and with AssistEdge. And now with more than 160 AI based scenarios across 70 clients, Nia is central to all our conversations with clients. And what started as a journey of IT use cases has quickly moved to strategic business areas like sales operation, demand sensing, supply chain, digital contracts and policy management, and other critical business areas where we are seeing even greater traction.", "In Edgewell, we had a strong performance with 24 wins and 21 go lives for Finacle and 12 wins and 17 go lives for Edge products. We launched the pilot blockchain network for international remittances, which is already live in some banks. Across all new areas we continue to drive Design Thinking into all our engagements with clients and build out our strategic design consulting practice where we are helping BP, for example, to reimagine their HR on boarding experience, Adient to accelerate their transformation in the rapidly evolving automotive industry, ERM to reimagine the sustainability challenges of the future and Spark in New Zealand where leaders can timeframe and rapidly prototype solutions to the most important problems in their highly disruptive markets.", "Finally this quarter we wrapped up our efforts around the rollout of GST in India, which launched on the 1st of July. The system has already handled a peak of 1.2 million daily logins and up 40 million page views and between 20,000 and 40,000 concurrent users at its peak. Once complete, this will be one of the largest open source project and the largest tax project in the world.", "As we speak, we are proud and humbled to be handling the digital economic infrastructure for the entire country from company formation to direct and indirect tax.

Thank you.", "A - M. D. Ranganath", "Thank you, Vishal. Hello everyone. Vishal has already talked about revenues and business outlook. Apart from revenues, the key outcome of the quarter has been strong cash generation and improved operational efficiencies, which is reflected in operating margins. Let me address these one-by-one.", "Cash provided within operating activities as per consolidated IFRS was robust at $644 million. Likewise, free cash flow which is operating cash flow less capital expenditure increased to $558 million.

", "Coming to operational efficiencies, utilization excluding trainees increased to further to 84% as compared to 80.5% in Q1 last year. Likewise, total employee cost as a percentage of revenue reduced to 54.6% in Q1 this year from 55% in Q1 last year.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri", "Hi, thanks. Guys you\u2019ve a significant uptick in utilization rates during the quarter. I think you reached about 84% ex trainees, maxed out here and then what\u2019s left in terms of leverage for sustaining margins within the guided range? And then I also have a -- another follow-up. Thanks.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes. So, on utilization, we have just been \u2026", "Vishal Sikka", "Hey, Moshe -- Ravi you want to answer this? Maybe Ravi can answer this.", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes, hi. So on utilization, we had just been working very hard on how to get this to where we have brought to, starting from working on the quality of demand to working at the bottom of the pyramid, that's where utilization is the hardest to achieve. We still have a little more buffer around there, if I may. And then looking at the way we do role mix in our projects. Here on, depending on how the quality of demand is, we can continue to work hard on streamlining it. Remember one thing, in the last 2 to 3 years the firm actually went through a federated sales structure in the consolidated delivery structure. So that give us a kind of a platform to make the efficiency work and to put them to get to here, because that helped us to take out any pockets or any silos, if I may, in the structure. So a bunch of things we could continue to do from here on to keep the momentum up, the price -- assuming the pricing drop doesn't happen, or assuming the pricing can hold up, we have a bunch of levers. The on-site mix has still gone up a little bit from last few quarters and we might have to look at how to keep it in control as Ranga earlier said. There is still an opportunity to do more automation. We have had a good runway on automation this quarter. We're hoping to see more accelerated benefits out of automation as we go forward, but what could also happen is we are also hiring talent in the U.S and if we can actually get back talent into projects, then I think that will help us on our model. So these are a few other levers we can actually start working on from here on. And the last one I want to talk about in terms of margin is the ability to get newer services which are much more profitable as a higher proportion of our revenues, because it just helps us to keep the trajectory up.", "Vishal Sikka", "So, thanks Ravi. Moshe just to add to what Ravi said, the -- when I started, we were at 76%, 77% utilization and we used to hear that the wheels would come off at 78%, and then the wheels would come off at 80%, and the wheels would come off at 82%. So we are at 84% and the wheels still haven't come off, so there is probably little bit more room, not much perhaps, but like Ravi said there are the various operating parameters in terms of optimizing the execution efficiency. But the most important one obviously is automation and especially bringing more and more automation into the fixed-price project and into the maintenance, and -- maintenance projects, the large-scale managed service projects and so forth.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay.", "Vishal Sikka", "And new services tend to make up a higher margin and especially new software, so more that we emphasize on those aspects of the business, the more of a effect that we can start to have on margin.", "Moshe Katri", "To add on -- sorry go ahead.", "S. Ravi Kumar", "If you look at the other focus area has been on the on-site employee cost as a percentage of revenue, as well as the total employee cost as a percentage of revenue, of course this is some kind of -- it's not just utilization describes this, there are also elements of the role ratios in a project. For example, fixed-price project on-site is way the bulk of our focus is, how could we release top heavy projects with more senior resources, because the revenue is not going to be impacted, but how could we release them and efficiency redeploy in other projects with higher billing rates and so on. This will also address better efficiencies on-site and that\u2019s one focus area for us not just this quarter or the last couple of quarters as well. So as a result, if you look at our on-site employee cost as a percentage of revenue has come down to 38.5% as compared to 39.3% same quarter last year, despite pricing decline and so on. So likewise the overall employee cost. I think these are -- and one of the element is the net headcount. Of course, a part of it is because of high utilization, net headcount this quarter was minus 1,800 as compared to a plus 3,000 previous quarter. And most importantly the -- if you look at the year-on-year revenue growth while it has been 6.3%, the headcount growth has been 0.8%. So I think the multiple parts we need to look at, but while we appreciate and we clearly recognize the fact that operating levers in the medium-term will kind of -- will kind of plateau out, the primary focus needs to be some -- the other measures that I talked about.", "Moshe Katri", "Okay. Just as a follow-up, so when asked about quarterly bookings or TCV in your earlier media appearances, I think Pravin indicated that you have mostly renewals this quarter and down the road this metric will become less and less relevant given the Company's increased focus on new digital areas. So, one, can you confirm your commentary on renewals? And then, two, are your selling efforts now will exclusively be focusing on digital and pretty much less and less on legacy services? Thanks a lot.", "Pravin Rao", "Hi. This is Pravin here. On the large deals the run rate is similar to what we have seen earlier quarters on an average around -- slightly around $800 million, but a big percentage of it is renewals. And over the last few quarters we have been focusing on building out on new services and new software and for the first time this quarter we published our metrics on that. We believe that these are the services that will be the future for us in the coming years as we embark on our transformation journey. So far large deals and other things will probably become irrelevant over a period of time. We have -- most of the focus will be on newer technologies, ticket savings [ph] will be much smaller and so on. Having said that, we will continue to compete aggressively on large deals. We will continue to win our fair share of large deals. We're not walking away from that, but as a metric we are focusing on pure metrics which will be probably be more relevant in future.", "Moshe Katri", "Great. Good execution. Thanks.", "Pravin Rao", "Okay. Just to clarify the total TCV for this quarter is 657 for large deals. I just want to clarify that.", "Moshe Katri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi. So everyone at this point has been talking about having digital practices. I\u2019m wondering could you clarify for us what your differentiator is in those newer digital practices? And is this a case of everybody's kind of participating in this wave or do you feel it at some point it's going to become a market share game like the other businesses?", "Vishal Sikka", "Hey, Joseph. That\u2019s a great question. You know I have for the last couple of years I have said that when people ask me how much of your business is digital, I always say it is a 100%, because we ranked software for digital computers and -- joking aside, the reality is that as you said there is always an adoption curve in these things and at any given point in time there is an emerging set of services, emerging set of technologies that require a new skill development, new capability development, and bringing new solution and even new IP into the market to do that. And on the one hand, we have to commoditize and bring a large-scale through these technologies as much as possible, and on the other hand we want to do that as early as possible when typically the scale and skill development is not there yet. So if you look at today's status for instance, virtual reality and augment reality technologies or voice interfaces, I mean Electra or the Amazon voice service just crossed 15,000 skills that are available for Electra in -- by the end of June, or if you look at the various voice and chat interfaces, AI and machine learning technologies, autonomous driving technologies, one of the programs that we have put in place here is to train several thousand people in autonomous driving technology. Where earlier today I have demonstrated one of our indigenously built golf cart -- autonomous system for the golf -- for a golf cart and that was done right here in our Mysore facility by our engineering services team to train our employees on autonomous technologies, autonomous driving technologies. So there is always this emerging set of areas where the sooner you can start building capability and skill, the better you can monetize the higher value, higher margin, higher ARPU kind of services. And so coming back to the point of 8.3% in new services and the 1.6% in new software, is all examples of services on software that we did not have on the 1st of April in 2015. So that is completely new revenue from the last -- a little bit more than two years. And if you look at the $2 billion in growth that we have had since then, this is a -- a $1 billion of that $2 billion have come from the new software and new services and that is something that we're really proud of. And so we're counting on a much higher growth in these areas, which tend to be the AI first, cloud first, kind of areas, cyber security, IoT things like this where we\u2019re building next-generation capabilities and earlier today somebody asked me about this, how does this compare to the digital revenue and we did despite my -- I was repeatedly saying that everything we do is visible, we benchmarked our services compared to the way other peers of ours do in the industry and that number is approximately 23%. So approximately 23% of our services revenue. Our revenue is from this digital services and the 8.3% and 1.3% that I talked about is a part of that 23%.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. Did you give a number on the growth rate of the 23%?", "Vishal Sikka", "No, not yet. The -- I mean, the growth rate -- this is the first quarter that we\u2019ve done this fine-grained auditable reporting of these numbers. So going forward, you'll be able to measure the growth rate. But when it comes to the new services, what I can say is that the revenue from these was zero in April 2015, so that means that all of the roughly $1 billion now is new.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. Okay. You talked about confidence in the rebound in financial services in the second half of the year. Are these actual conversations or contracts? Do you have visibility to that or is that more of a macro call, in fact, the interest rates have gotten a bit better and the spreads have widened a little bit for banks?", "Vishal Sikka", "Yes, Joseph. Pravin, why don\u2019t you can answer this one?", "Pravin Rao", "Sure, Vishal. Joseph, so at this point of time, this is a belief that we\u2019ve. Again, as you rightly pointed out, based on the macro trends that we are seeing and also from the greater degree of client confidence that we are seeing. And this is a very U.S specific thing, right. If you see our results in Europe and in Australia, we continue to have a very strong performance for the sector. For insurance, we continue to have a very strong performance.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. And then the final one for me, I mean, we saw pricing tick up. Can you give us an update on the pricing environment and how you think about that in relations to margin going forward? Thanks.", "Vishal Sikka", "So the way we see that is obviously the new services demand a higher pricing premium. And so the more that we focus on those things, the better. And by bringing automation into the traditional services and being able to get more productive at it, that is another way that we can stem this declining pricing tides [ph]. So those are some of the factors that have run into this.", "Joseph Foresi", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Bergin", "Hi. Thank you. A bit of a follow-up here on the competitive dynamics in the new service areas. Are you mostly self sourcing a lot of this work?", "Vishal Sikka", "Ravi, you want to answer this?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes. So new services that the challenge is not as much about demand. It's actually about how do you build talent and capabilities to address them, because a large part of that is already available as opportunities in the market. With existing customers, a lot of them which are very contemporary and new are actually coming to us based on existing relationships. It's slightly matured ones which actually need, I would say, a sense of steady-state. Those are the ones which actually go through a procurement process than RFP process, but if we can call it out early, we obviously have a short there. But the key messages in new services, a majority of them is all about how do you build talent and competency pools to fulfill them. That to me is the key. It's not as much the demand, but it's as much about how do you build capabilities to fulfill the demand.", "Mohit Joshi", "Yes, and this is Mohit here. Just want to add one small point to this. It's wherever we are able to use our own software, right, those discussions that yet to be more of sole sourced discussions. So if we are able to sell our Nia platform or sell the idea of the used case around Nia to apply, then the sort of attached new services will be sole sourced. So for instance, for the U.S based bank, we were able to sell consulting and our Infosys signification platform, because they were looking to incentivize their field force for a greater cross-sell. So something like this would be sole sourced.", "Bryan Bergin", "Okay. That's helpful. So do you change your approach at all as it relates to industry alliances and potentially increasing M&A in new service areas to accelerate growth there?", "Vishal Sikka", "Yes. The -- so Bryan, when it comes to the acquisition of talent as Ravi talked about, acquisition of skill, using agency subcontracting and also using equity hires and acquisitions as a strategy to hire some of this talent, it's something that we\u2019re working on. The longer-term sustained approach obviously is to develop our own training and as I mentioned earlier, we have built the world's largest ever Design Thinking training endeavor and we have trained more than 142,000 people on this. Similarly we have now working on developing more detailed, more deeper design engagement, kinds of initiative. So that you can participate in the transformational journey of the clients and not just beyond the receiving end of a particular services project or something of this nature. And then, when it comes to M&A and so forth obviously those are all mechanisms available to us to develop more capability and more talent in this. The Skava platform also helps in getting into some of these areas as does the Nia platform in bringing AI capability and -- so that the software can amplify our productivity, our profitability and our ability to build new kinds of scenarios.", "Bryan Bergin", "Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up just on the GST contracting, can you comment on scale of that and really I guess the whether it's kind of a one-time type of contract or if that carries forward as we -- as you continue to implement solutions there? I\u2019m just trying to understand how they may have impacted the quarter.", "S. Ravi Kumar", "First of all, this quarter the incremental revenue from GST was negligible. It was less than $3 million, that is one point. So GST hardly provided an incremental revenue this quarter. Second, if you look at the ROW incremental revenue that we saw this quarter's primarily from Australia, which is a very profitable market. Coming to GST and the trajectory, as you know GST has two phases, build phase and maintenance phase. We're pretty much at the fag-end of the build phase, then the maintenance phase would kick start. And the trajectory is also from one in which is kind of more -- we do not expect too much of lumpiness, much more gradual progress. They are all linked to certain milestones and deliverables. So that's what we visualize on GST at this point.", "Bryan Bergin", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.", "David Koning", "Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess, first of all, the margin this quarter was a little bit above the midpoint of your full-year guidance. Usually Q1 is a low point and I believe a lot of that maybe has to do with the timing of the wage increases, but is it fair to think this year Q1 might not be the low point of your margins for the year?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Hi. This is Ranga here. I think, if you look at this year's Q1, 24.1 is same as last year same quarter, it's 24.1. As I was telling, we were impacted by 80 basis points on rupee which was offset to some extent by the cross currency by about 20 basis points. Large part of margin uptick was also due to the utilization and the pricing realization which gave us 90 basis and 50 basis points and we increased the variable pay to employees this year based on the revenue performance. So sequentially that plus some of these subcon costs were additional headwind of 140 basis points. So that\u2019s the broad math. But coming to your question, we are -- we have actually announced the compensation increases effective July and the compensation increases incremental delta would be around 0.7% to 0.8%. That would be the broad impact on these compensation increases.", "David Koning", "Okay. So Q2 might be sequentially down a debate based on that?", "M. D. Ranganath", "That is one and the compensation increases. Of course, as you know the margin trajectory for any quarter apart from this comp is also a factor of how much is a sequential revenue, as well as some of the how the trajectory of rupee and so on. And some of the other levers that we talked about I think it will be a combination of all these factors.", "David Koning", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then just maybe one follow-up, the interest in other income remains quite strong, the yield is good obviously on cash in India. Was there anything one-off in the $127 million of interest other that might not carry into the following quarters or is that a pretty good base to keep building on in future quarters?", "M. D. Ranganath", "I think there is nothing unusual about it. It consistently -- it has interest income and other -- the income from the other investments that we have. At the same time, we also have this hedges right, any profits made on hedges also flow into other income and it has been consistent across all the quarters.", "David Koning", "Okay, great. And I guess, finally just real quick, is July the new ongoing wage increase quarter like you think in future years that is going to be the same timing?", "M. D. Ranganath", "I think what we have, if you look at the last year, the -- while for the junior employees we started early and for the senior employees we have kind of gradually spread it over quarters, depending upon the progress of the revenue trajectory last year, and in our BPO business that has been there for quite some time. This year of course we have done from effective July and so we would at this point in time see all the increases effective July.", "David Koning", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi. My first question was with regards to Pravin's comment about the $657 million of large deal TCV. And my question is there -- if you look at that on a vertical basis, is there anything in there, Pravin, that suggests that there will be an acceleration in BFS consistent with what you're contemplating for the second half?", "Mohit Joshi", "This is Mohit here. I think look, BFS has always been a fairly significant contributor to the overall large deal volume, not just for this quarter, but consistently for the past six to eight quarters. And that's the trend that that even this quarter's vertical break up will show. In terms of large deal pipeline and large deal momentum, I think we are seeing a reasonable momentum. Deal cycles have become a bit longer especially in the U.S., the decision timeframes are taking longer, but there is nothing unusual or radical that we see there. The confidence about -- and again I think Joseph had asked this question earlier about why we\u2019re making a call? And it is primarily a macro call, it is primarily a macro call, which is supplemented by the discussions that we\u2019re having with our clients. And while you would notice that we\u2019ve not seen a significant uptick in their budget, there is a lot more confidence, there is a lot more pressure from business on discretionary spend, there is a lot more focus on spending on new technology areas like AI in digital and so it is a subjective call based on those factors. Finally I will also mention that given the fact that in this financial services business, we have such a huge concentration of clients, right. Just one or two clients can really make or break a quarter, $5 million or $6 million or $10 million increase or a decrease with a single client can really impact the sequential growth. And in this case, we have a couple of clients were growth has been lagging for the past three or four quarters and we expect that in this client specific instances that their spend will pick up in the second half of our financial year.", "James Friedman", "Yes. I think \u2026", "Vishal Sikka", "And just to add that, James -- yes, go ahead.", "James Friedman", "No, no. I apologize, Vishal. Go ahead.", "Vishal Sikka", "So just to add to that, I mean, it is -- we are not giving up on large deals. We are simply saying that the large deals in the commoditizing services are going to be increasingly be not so relevant and we want -- that's why we are publishing and focusing on the new services and new software areas. When it comes to large deals, wherever there are large deals, obviously we will be vigorously and with a lot of focus and attention competing for those, we have spent a lot of effort in becoming much more competitive and winning larger deals by using better solution, bringing AI, and especially bringing Design Thinking into the solutions, into deep -- more deeply understanding the problems at the root of the large deals that are being proposed and also in our engagement process and so forth so you see a significant improvement in our large deal wins and conversion rates over the last many quarters. But having said that, it is just the commoditizing services and going after big projects which is a -- it's not something that we see as a strategic area as much as we see the new services and the new software. So this is what you're seeing in our commentary.", "James Friedman", "Yeah, that's helpful context [ph]. Thank you. And then, Ranga, I just wanted to ask you about the subcontractor costs, I realize that that maybe to some degree be a function of the utilization heat. But where -- because that was up a 100 basis points year-over-year on my math, where should we anticipate that travel into over the course of the year?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes, you\u2019re right. Primary uptick if you recollect few quarters ago, it had gone up to 6.3%, I think Q3 of FY16 and we\u2019ve very consciously brought it down to 5.3% two quarters ago and it started again inching upwards. One of the key pieces is really the higher utilization level and the second one is typically what we have tried to do is prioritize to subcon cost for new services where the billing rates are higher and the margins are better. So one ways to put more away from the subcon costs in the other services and move towards this, that is one at least even if it is as a percentage of revenue is high, one approach has been could we at least look at the profitability of those subcon costs -- subcon expenses and redirect the expenses to more profitable service lines. So that\u2019s one approach. But in the short-term we do see this being at these levels till we have much more efficiencies in talent planning kicking in and as our on-site hiring picks up.", "James Friedman", "Great. Mohit, Ranga and Vishal thank you. Thank you for your comments.", "M. D. Ranganath", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.", "Anil Doradla", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions. Vishal, you\u2019ve talked about 10,000 employees in the U.S. and I think your initial focus is a couple thousand. So where are you today -- I mean, in terms of have you started kind the job requisitions, are they out today? And what is it -- what is going to be the mix between experienced and new hires here?", "Vishal Sikka", "Anil, Ravi can answer this.", "S. Ravi Kumar", "Yes. So, yes, thanks for the question. So we\u2019ve -- we put a plan for 10,000 hires in two years. We wanted to do it in 4 to 5 centers depending on how we get there. We put a set of criteria on how to establish those centers. I\u2019ve earlier spoken about how the model which we operate on, which is an on-site offshore model will kind of morph [ph] to an on-site near shore offshore model and the near shore centers are the ones which we're talking about, which is primarily innovation and technology hubs where we believe clients and Infosys employees and clients can come together and work on in an agile fashion. So then the experienced talent which we hire in the U.S is an ongoing process, that hasn't stopped.", "That will continue to go forward. We would hire for deploying to client sites. Now the next step of hiring is to hire into the centers, so that we could transition into the on-site near shore offshore model and use them under the cluster of clients which are in and around those centers. So last quarter we did almost 600 plus. We\u2019ve already hired 600 plus joined us last quarter. We\u2019ve already hired around 500 plus from campus -- campuses across the U.S. They\u2019re going to join us and the first batch has actually joined us and they are going to continue to join us for the next few months. And we will keep hiring round the year till the end of the year. So the idea is to train them there, build those capabilities and actually have them into projects in the treaty or model I spoke about. And a lot of it is in contemporary skill, so we\u2019re actually hiring them on in and around the clusters of where the -- where those locations are, and then we\u2019re going to train, tap, and push them into projects. So the journey has already started. Campus hiring is round the year. The experienced talent continues. The normal thing it continues to happen for our client locations and then the third feeder which we will get is refactoring talent in adjacent areas. So that third feeder in the 10,000. Pressures experience hires and refactored talent. So that\u2019s something we will kick off as well. So we\u2019re doing the local enablement, local training, local hiring and then deploying into projects.", "Anil Doradla", "Great. And I think, Ranga, you talked about focusing on new metrics. Now these business models are changing, you are seeing a lot of automation in new additional technologies. Are there some metrics that we as an industry are not looking at today could potentially be part of your kind of financial model? Are there some metrics that you might introduce over the next, call it year or two, as the business models change?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Well, I think primarily whichever service line that we look at, it's extremely important for us to focus on three key elements, which is the per capita revenue. Per capita revenue of the service line as well as the on-site mix of a service line and that profitability which is a result into both put together. Now what we\u2019ve attempted this quarter is really by calling of new services, we want to give a view to the investors on the trajectory of the new services as a percentage of as our total revenue as well as the incremental revenue. For example, this quarter we\u2019ve stated it is 8.3%, so next quarter the investors would be getting a perspective on how this trajectory of 8.3% both at relative and absolute terms is changing. Now as we move forward in couple of quarters, certainly as some of those services become a critical size, for example about six groups of services contributing to 8.3% and one of them might even pick up in the relative 4%, 5% et cetera, at that point in time we want to call out some of the key metrics that I talked about. So essentially I think that would be one -- that's one thing clearly on our mind in the coming quarters.", "Anil Doradla", "Okay. So as it becomes bigger, each of these could be further broken down by some of the metrics that you are talking about?", "M. D. Ranganath", "Absolutely.", "Anil Doradla", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shashi Bhusan from IDFC Securities. Please go ahead.", "Shashi Bhusan", "Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats to a good quarter. 2.5 year back when we started the journey towards the transformation, which had acquisition as an integral part. However, there has been no action over the last few quarter. Is there any change in the strategy or we're not finding the right \u2013 right price? Can you elaborate on our newest strategy for the same?", "Vishal Sikka", "Hey Shashi, it is more of the latter. It\u2019s finding the right companies at the right price. The right companies meaning companies that are companies of tomorrow with technology and advanced technology, strategic area that we want to be in, not buying companies from of yesterday. And the right price obviously is the right price. So that combination is not easy obviously and -- but we are committed to it. Last quarter we bought a small company called Sky Tree, which had very unique machine learning expertise to make it a part of our Nia platform. And wherever we see opportunities like this, we will continue to do that. But we do wish to see acquisition as a key part of our story going forward, but not -- we don't want to buy backward looking technologies. We don't want to buy market share or revenue growth. We want to buy purposeful technologies of the future.", "Shashi Bhusan", "Sure. And the second question related to -- coming from two quarters of low single-digit growth due to client specific issues this quarter performance was a good positive surprise, I would say. Would it be fair to say that top client specific issue are behind? And follow-up to that is, our second half tend to be weaker over the last few years barring few exceptions. Given our deal win and pipeline, any color on the same how it looks in FY18?", "Vishal Sikka", "It's too early to talk about the second half of the year, although as our software business becomes bigger, obviously, some of the seasonality would not apply, but obviously it would continue to apply to the services business. And in terms of the -- what was the other question?", "Shashi Bhusan", "Other question was client specific issue?", "Vishal Sikka", "Yes, in some of these super large clients we have -- we already have a very large market share and so that's where we are, but we are generally adding. So when I started, we had $1,200 million account. That number went up to 19 previous quarter and now 18. And the 18 is just because one client had a couple million dollar movement, so I put them out of the $100 million number for the quarter. But I'm not particularly worried about that. We have a dedicated focus on top clients and the second tier below the top 25 are actually going quite robustly. So we want to continue to make sure that there is a healthy balance there between the focus on the top clients and the second tier ones. There isn't anything -- I know some of the analysts have written about this, but I am -- I don't see anything in particular and what's going on with the top clients to be concerned about.", "Shashi Bhusan", "Sure. And any reason why we\u2019ve stopped sharing some of the client buckets like $200 million and $300 million, even top clients in this quarter?", "S. Ravi Kumar", "I think, we kind of wanted to focus on the $100 million plus and $100 million plus typically includes $200 million and $300 million, but if the question is, if there is a decline in the number of $200 million or $300 million quarter clients this quarter? No, that\u2019s not the reason, because we\u2019ve seen the same number of $200 million clients and $300 million clients in this quarter as it was last quarter. There is no decline there. $100 million there is a decline by one which was a narrow miss by maybe $2 million or something. So beyond that there is nothing more to read to it, and we will continue to publish the $100 million which is our core focus.", "Shashi Bhusan", "[Indiscernible].", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I would now like to hand over the floor back to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo for his closing comments. Over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "We would like to thank everyone for joining us on this call. Wish you a good weekend ahead and look forward to talking to you again.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines."]}

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. And there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions, after the presentation concludes. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I'll now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Mahindroo. Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo - Infosys Ltd.", "Thanks, Karuna. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Infosys' earnings call to discuss Q2 FY 2018 results. This is Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining us today on this call is Non-Executive Chairman, Mr. Nandan Nilekani; Interim CEO and MD, Mr. Pravin Rao; CFO, Mr. M. D. Ranganath; Presidents and the other members of the senior management team.", "This call is for 90 minutes and will be split up into two parts. The first part will begin with Mr. Nandan Nilekani giving some updates on the board matters, followed by which, we'll open up the call for questions to Nandan on the areas that he talked about. This part of the call will be for 30 minutes. The second part of the call will be for 60 minutes and will commence with opening remarks by Pravin and Ranga on the performance of the company during the quarter. Subsequent to which, we'll once again open up the call this time to the management team for questions.", "Please note that anything which we say, which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I'd now like to pass it on to Mr. Nilekani.", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Thank you, Sandeep. And good morning, and good evening to everyone on this call. It's really great to be back on the call talking to you. I spoke to all of you last on 25th August, when I had just taken over as the Non-Executive Chairman and during that call, I had outlined various priorities that the board would focus on.", "So, let me give you an update of that as well as the \u2013 what basically came out of the strategy refresh. In terms of the process of identifying the next CEO, that process has begun and a series of actions are being taken on that. And things are progressing well, and we will get back to all of you once we have a decision to report on that matter.", "On the shareholder consultation. One round of meetings have happened with shareholders, and we have paused that and the second round will start after our results and we expect to complete the shareholder reach \u2013 outreach either through meetings or through online questionnaire, and we hope to have the full report ready for you \u2013 for by January results.", "We had also said that the Nominations and Remuneration Committee would present a long-term governance structure, which they have presented a preliminary one in the board meeting today. We hope to have a final one by the time we meet in January.", "On the buyback, I think it's progressing as expected, and later on, our CFO Mr. Ranganath will give you more details of the status of the buyback. On the investigation into the Panaya matter and the Rajiv Bansal severance issue, we had said last time that the board under my leadership would conduct a detailed investigation and talk to all the investigators and find out what's happening, we've done that and you will see in our press release we have given a detailed statement of the outcome of that investigation.", "And finally, the company as you know has declared an interim dividend, which is as per the capital allocation policy of 70% of free cash flow being allocated for payouts. So that broadly are some of the decisions or progress reports on the various items that we had outlined in the 25th August meeting.", "Now let me come to you on the strategy side. I think, first of all, let me say that our management team led by Pravin have done an amazing job in a quarter, where there was a lot of events happening and a bit of turbulence and so on. The fact that they were able to remain on course, they were able to deal with the changes, they were able to deal with changes of the CEO, change of the Chairman, and performed so well, I think is a great accolade to organization and the resilience and strength of our people. So, I think as I finish this part of the call, in the second part of this call, you'll be able to engage with management and they'll talk about the performance of the quarter and anything else that is relevant on that.", "But one of the other things, we did this quarter and this was done as part of the commitments we had spoken was that we did what we call the strategy refresh. And the strategy refresh was really to understand exactly what we need to do, whether we're doing all the right things, whether we had to do something differently, whether we have to change the emphasis and so on. And I'm really delighted to say that we had an excellent strategy refresh, which has now given us complete clarity on what we need to do going forward. This strategy refresh was done in a very collaborative and consensus driven way. It was conducted by Deepak Padaki, who is the Head of Strategy. We had the Committee of Directors, Mr. Ravi Venkatesan and Mr. Prahlad, actively engage in this process. And of course, all the Presidents, Ravi Kumar, Mohit, Rajesh were all involved, Ranganath was involved, everybody was involved in this, and we also reached out to all the senior leadership, the top people who do sales, the top people in delivery, the top people in business enabling functions and so on.", "And finally, after conducting hundreds of interviews and getting the feedback and also talking to our customers, our management team had a three-day conference about 10 days back, where they met and really thrash it out. So, let me explain briefly what we see is happening. As you know, our business is providing business and IT services to the world's largest corporations, many of whom are market leaders in the segments that they serve. And as you know, our strength has been the long-term strategic multi-year relationships that we have with these companies, and that we play such an integral and essential role in their journey and their use of technology. That is really the core strength. And just this morning, we had a customer survey feedback, and we were really delighted to find that our customers ranked us very highly for the quality of services that we offer.", "Now, we know that our customers who are these large companies across the world, Fortune 500 or Global 2000 companies are facing various simultaneous and disruptive challenges. They are being disrupted by digital competition, their new tech-savvy digital competitors, and there is a rapid substitution of legacy products with new technology. The big change in the last 10 years has been the rise of the consumer-led innovation with the iPhone and Android phones and so on. And 15 years back, businesses did the innovation and then it came to consumers, but today it's other way around, innovation happens with consumers, and then these migrate to the business. And now therefore, a big part of the challenge that our customers face is how to provide their employees and their customers the same digital experience, ease of use that they get used to on the apps on the phones. So that's a big challenge that our customers face.", "The other big development has been the rise of distribution. So, many industries, be it media, be it television, filmmaking, those who have customers are the people who have control, and therefore you have people, who have distribution to a wide number of customers and then leveraging that to build content or to channelize content through that distribution channel and make money through subscription or advertising.", "Then, of course, we've seen the rise of Internet of Things, centers everywhere. And the whole role of data in transformation and database business models have become very big in the last 10 years. And the thing about data is that it has a winner-take-all behavior, where those who have more data can understand more about their customers, those who understand more of their customers can design new products and services for these customers. And then, they \u2013 because the products and services are so well designed, they get additional customers. So, data is a virtuous cycle, and therefore, the nature of business is changing because of data.", "Also, with the rise of machine learning and deep learning, it's possible to run these machine learning algorithms against large troves of data to draw insight. And to that extent, domain knowledge itself is getting commoditized. And then, we are also in an era, where applications developed by our incumbent customers originally designed to be behind the firewall are now being exposed to the Internet. And if these are not adequately secured with encryption and so on, they are likely to be cyber security issues and hacking and so on. So, a big challenge is how do you ensure that new systems are designed with rigor and old systems are made more secure through various interventions.", "And then, of course, we're seeing new technology platforms emerging like clouds, AI platforms and so on, and our customers are facing the challenge of how to get more for the dollars they spend on technology, even as they are adding budgets to the spend, they are looking at how to become more efficient. So, verily, we see two things happening for us, one is a huge demand for new services, and later on my colleagues Ravi Kumar and others will talk about how new services are really growing at a great pace. And therefore, our job is to build these new services, make them hugely grow very fast and provide the growth for the future.", "At the same time, our customers who are investing are trying to make sure that their investment in their traditional services is optimized, so they want to use more automation and more streamlining, straight through processing, process automation and so on. And therefore they're simultaneously looking at us to provide new services, as well as make sure that the earlier traditional services are automated. So, we are facing both these challenges, at the same time.", "We also have the issue that how do we think about solutions, how do we think about our services. And there we believe strongly that our strategy of software plus services is very valid, because it's not about services alone, it's about having a platform, which is basically built using a lot of open source components, and then put together to a harness which puts all the components together, and then configuring these products to solve specific needs of our customers. And that's exactly what we are doing with the NIA platform.", "We have done a detailed thorough analysis of NIA, both internally and externally. There are many good things, there are things that need to be improved and we are working systematically on improving them, so that they can be scaled up and made applicable to a large number of our customers, as well as the way we approach it to our customers, the go-to-market we are looking at how to make that more efficient. So we are completely committed to the software platform or software product plus services model, but the important thing is that we are looking at complete integration between the two, because ultimately, it's about our customers who are wanting these large transformation, combining the products, combining our various services and actually transforming, and that is really where the big opportunity for us is. And so, we expect to do that very well.", "We're also seeing that a big challenge for us will be reinventing and reskilling our people. We have to \u2013 just as we modernize and offer new services, it's important that our team, whether they be the people in the front in sales or the people in delivery or the people supporting business or the people in consulting, they all have to be completely up-to-date and current with the latest trends in technology, software architecture, open source, machine learning, analytics, whatever it is. And therefore, having a very agile anytime, anywhere learning platform is something that we think is key to our competitive advantage and we have a team working under Tan Moorthy and Thiru (12:56) fundamentally to see how our learning platforms can be completely upgraded so that people can get access to learning wherever they are, on whatever device they have, for whatever length of time they're free.", "So all these things are being put together. We are also looking at how to make sure the organization more agile, because our customers expect us to solve problems quickly to be able to respond to market needs, to be able to prototype and offer solutions and then, rapidly iterate them to use new kinds of integrated DevOps, where software is released every day and there's a full automated testing of it and single version control on the cloud, lots of things of that nature have to be done, and we're looking at doing that. And I think we are looking at how to get our leadership fully aligned so that we get our customers going forward.", "So I think this is something which has been done. Specifically, we are rapidly scaling up our new digital services, as you can see, this and later on when you speak to management, they will show you how there is rapidly growing double-digit quarterly growth in our new digital services and they're rescaling at the same time. We are evolving our platform. So, we are looking at how our flagship AI platform, NIA, along with the automation platforms of AssistEdge, how they can come together to create a complete range of automation and machine learning capabilities for our customers. And we have today a large number of places where we are looking at both where they are being used, either being used to solve some problem or they're doing proof of concept, and we're taking a systematic look and see how we can scale that across the company.", "We're also integrating and evolving our design capabilities so that we can accelerate the digital businesses. And we have \u2013 as I said, when I began, our strength is trusted relationships which have spanned multiple years with some of the world's largest and most iconic companies. And I think the fact that we have these relationships, the fact these relationships have often lasted for decades, and the fact that these customers come to us for a significant part of what they have to do, is really the source of our strategic advantage. And we believe that as we continue to offer them more and more of the new kind of services, as we are able to give them the kind of thinking and ability to configure, and put things together to transform themselves, we only will see more growth with these customers.", "At the same time, our new way of doing things with this combination of software and services will also be enable us to get access to customers who are not currently with us. So, it's both our ability to grow our business with existing customers, as well as a way for us to differentiate as we get new customers on board. And increasingly, what we are finding is that the kind of solutions we have to offer have a significant impact on business outcomes. And therefore, we are able to see how we can offer these as business solutions, where it's not just about technological cost saving, but making an impact on customers or increasing sales or increasing profits or whatever it is that is required by the customer on the business side.", "Let me also say that we are embracing automation aggressively. We have both automation in our services to offer our customers business transformation opportunity, as well as automating our traditional services so that our customers are able to get better value, we are able to get better value and we can remain competitive, they can become more productive. So, we have a complete initiative now to not only just look at automation in pockets, but how to apply it across the firm.", "And then, we are also addressing diversity, we have now a plan. As you know, we announced a plan to hire several thousand people in the U.S. We are setting up local hubs. We're working closely with the U.S. state governments and doing that. And that is another big differentiation that we are seeing that our customers are also welcoming our initiative to do this and want to partner with us to leverage these kind of centers that we have, which are also in the same time zone and which give them rapid flexibility.", "So I think we are very excited by what we are doing. We have taken complete stock of our product thing. We're bringing the NIA and Edge platforms together. We're looking at all our other investments, be it in Finacle, Panaya or with Skava. So we'll continue to push that, but we look at more closer integration between our products and our services so that the combined thing gives us the solutions that our customers want, and the key thing is integration between the two. So, I think this is a strategy, which has come about by a process of both top-down and bottom-up work. It's a strategy which everybody has bought into. And we have a sufficient depth of technology, engineering and management expertise to execute on the strategy.", "So, we are very excited by the possibility of the future. And I think when we talk to you again in January and then in April, we'll be able to report more progress on this implementation. But the good news is that we have a complete alignment among all our internal and \u2013 stakeholders to work on this.", "So now, I'll stop and take questions on any of the board decisions and updates, as well as anything on strategy. And I'll do that for about 10 minutes, and then I'll hand over to Sandeep to then continue the call with management.", "So now, I think, Sandeep, we can open it up for questions, but let \u2013 my request to you is, the business performance questions, please reserve that for management, and limit your questions to me on board issues, governance issues and the strategy I just outlined.", "Question and Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with a question-and-answer session. Thank you. First question is from the line of Anantha Narayan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.", "Yeah. Thank you. Good evening, everyone and, Nandan, belated Diwali wishes to you and to the management team. I had two questions. My first question, Nandan, was on the strategy that you just outlined. So, as we went through this strategy refresh process, were there any elements of the strategy under Vishal, which were significantly modified?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Yeah. I don't want to get into a comparison of strategies. I think the experience that all of us have had is how to build a strategy, which is built both bottom-up and top-down. And so we have done that systematically. We have looked at elements, we have been very agnostic, where there is something good, we have kept it, where there's something which is not working, we have said this need not be done, where there's something good and needs work to be done, in tuning it, we are doing that. So, a lot of that is that kind of stuff.", "And I think the important thing is our clear commitment to extend this, scale it across the company and execute well. That's fairly, I think, for a large services company like Infosys with $10 billion dollars in revenue, annual revenue, and 200,000 employees, how do we take this out to everyone, how do we make sure the customer in New Zealand or in Dubai has access to this, how do you make sure that every employee has access to the latest skills. These are really fundamental block and tackle issues that had to be done at scale and speed.", "And we really looked at that, identified any gaps and also made sure that our alignment between product and service is very tight, because finally the customer doesn't really care which part of the solution is a product, which part is a service. He doesn't care which part is an open source product, which part is a proprietary product. All he cares about is our ability to configure these various things and provide him business benefit. And I think that requires huge amount of coordination internally between our various service owners, between our sales team and between our product guys. And that is something we are focusing on.", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.", "Thanks, Nandan. And then, my final question was on the review of investigations. So have you or the board, had a chance to engage with Mr. Moorthy after this process was completed, and is he now sort of completely satisfied with the review?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "I think that's a question you need to ask of him.", "Anantha Narayan - Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good evening. Thank you. I was curious if the company's approach to mergers and acquisitions might change, may accelerate or reduce. It sounds like maybe you're trying to step up the pace of shifting the company to be more digital and lot of your competitors have used acquisitions to do that. If you could give us your thoughts? Thank you.", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Sure. I think that's a great question. I think absolutely you're right. Our endeavor now in the next 12 months to 18 months is to accelerate our pace of change to aggressively embrace automation both for the traditional services, as well as use automation to make our new services more compelling. And so that's the fundamental driver.", "Now, you have to realize that if we have to do that, we also need to make sure that the current organization is capable of delivering on it, which is why we need to invest in learning, education, training, building new products, service, et cetera. So that part has to be done anyway. In addition to that, if there is some acquisition which is going to help us to accelerate this, absolutely, we will make those acquisitions. But those acquisitions have to fit into the strategic envelope that we are talking about. And I think you will see that this time, we did one acquisition on the Design side. So absolutely, if there's a particular part of the \u2013 piece of the puzzle, which requires a company which is there, which has the right knowledge skill set, technology or whatever, and if that fits in and that's going to accelerate it, definitely we will do acquisitions.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. My other question is, to be honest, I really didn't hear any change in strategy. So I'm a little confused on that. Is it a little less biased to sort of a software aspect than maybe in the prior administration, if you could get some sense on that? And the company's center of gravity was sort of shifting to Silicon Valley, is it now going to shift back to Bengaluru? Thank you.", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Well, I think, you know, when you talk about strategy at this level, a lot of it is how to execute that at scale and speed, how to integrate it across the company, how to bring different parts together, et cetera. And I think it's not something \u2013 I mean, it looks superficially the same, but actually reality when you get into the details, the nuances come out, but I won't really be able to get into all those details.", "The second thing is that, I think our Palo Alto \u2013 Palo Alto office continues to be a very vital part of our future. We see Palo Alto office as a listening post to the latest developments in technology happening in Silicon Valley about the latest developments in machine learning, AI, deep learning, virtual reality, automated reality, self-driving cars, whatever it is, that's coming out of that area. So we will have a strong presence in the Valley. We will have a strong team of long-term horizon technologies looking at the latest developments. We will also have a process by which as and when we understand these new technologies, we will have a process by which we can bring them to our enterprise customers and so how they can use this well.", "Because the real challenge is how do we take these technologies that are emerging and how do we use that to create business benefit for our customers. So, I think our presence in Palo Alto will be a very critical presence going forward, and we'll have the right team and the right leadership to take advantage of that location.", "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah. I want to try to follow on Ed's question in a different way. Your current revenue growth is around 5% constant currency and you're guiding revenues, round numbers, to 6% constant currency. Is that a level that you're satisfied with? Because it seems to be underperforming the industry.", "And the corollary of that is if you're not satisfied with that level of revenue growth \u2013 and that was the FY 2018 guidance rather you know plus or minus 6%, call it for round numbers, how do you anticipate changing the revenue growth rate to improve it and/or emulate what would be the growth rate of your competitors?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "We're satisfied with the performance, I think we delivered excellent growth and very good margins. Obviously, we have to look at what we've achieved in the first half year and look at what we expect to achieve in the second half and the guidance is based on that. But the important thing is that we are investing a lot of our time and energy in building the capabilities, building the pipeline for the future, and I think that's what you'll be seeing in the coming months.", "Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Sorry, just to push back. How are you concluding that the revenue growth that you just reported and the guidance is excellent? If the constant currency revenue growth is 6%, is that what you think industry growth is?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "I think \u2013 first of all, I think as you know, we had a quarter which was fairly eventful. We hired a change at the CEO level. We had a change at the Chairman level. We had a third of the board resigning and so on. So...", "Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yes.", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "...we had lot of turbulence right in the middle of the quarter. I think it is to the credit of our management team under Pravin's leadership that they continue to focus on customers, deal with any questions customers raise, continue to win new deals. So, yes, I think in the circumstances, I think it's an excellent performance.", "Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Fair enough. Then just...", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "This is Pravin here. I would like to add, I don't think we have really underperformed. If we look at both quarter one and quarter two, on the constant currency basis, our growth has been higher than our peers, majority of our peers. Even in quarter two, couple of our peers have announced their results and our constant currency numbers which we announced today is higher than what has been reported by our peers.", "So I wouldn't agree that our performance \u2013 industry growth rate is anyway high (29:05) at the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, there were some sense of what the industry growth rate would be, and at the end of the year, you will really see where we will land. So we'll have to just wait and watch.", "Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Fair enough. Many thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Viju George from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Viju K. George - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Nandan, I was just curious about this integration you talked about between products and services. What does this mean? Does this mean that while products are important as platforms, they may not really have an independent mandate, you know in so far as they may have had in Vishal's time, and what's the interplay you're seeing with services there?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "No, I think it depends on the product. For example, we have a product like Skava which is for digital e-commerce, mobile-first and all that, and that would require both independently that being sold, because that requires a particular type of product sales approach as well as integrate it as part of some combined offerings, so that's \u2013 that would be true of say something like Skava.", "On the other hand, something like NIA, which is really a platform of reusable open source components put together with a harness of scaffolding of development environment tools and which has very good capabilities on data analytics, machine learning, that is more likely to be provided along with a set of services, because our customers will expect us not only to provide those capabilities, they would expect us to provide those services, so that we can take a particular business problem and solve it. So, I think it depends on the product. Some products will have both standalone sales as well as integrated sales, some products are more likely to be part of only integrated sales.", "Viju K. George - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Sure. Thank you. And just as a follow on, in several of these products, do you think that product architects people capable of go-to-market for these products, that talent comes \u2013 can come from within Infosys or do you think they have to necessarily come from product companies like Vishal had attempted to do?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Oh, absolutely. One of the things, I've now been 60 days here and I've spend a lot of time. I'm very happy to see the talent depth in Infosys. There are thousands of people, who have experience in open source, there are thousands of people doing Data Scientist work, there are thousands of people with cloud experience, there are hundreds and \u2013 hundreds of people with architecture expertise.", "And also I think you must realize that the architecture requirements in this new world are not necessarily the way traditional products were designed. The architecture requirements in the new world require deep understanding of open source and scale. I mean, I don't know whether you guys know, but when they build the Aadhaar platform, which has a billion people on it, it does 1.5 billion transactions a month, it was entirely built on an open source stack.", "So I think, we know the people, who do these things. We have many people in Infosys who do that. I'm very comfortable that we have a deep managed manageable talent technical bench to do the new kind of technology architecture. At the same time, if on any particular dimension we need people, which who we can do either through hiring or acqui-hiring or so on, we will do that. There is no issue.", "Viju K. George - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Sure. Thank you, and all the best, Nandan.", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. My first question is just maybe you can give us an update on the search for the new CEO. And then along those lines, do you feel like this is given the strategy refresh going to be somebody who has to have a software background?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Well, I think first of all let me say that, we have a very elaborate and exhaustive process on the CEO selection. The process is anchored by the Nominations and Remunerations Committee Chaired by Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, the Chairman of Biocon and she's assisted on that by \u2013 with Mr. Prahlad, Mr. Ravi Venkatesan and Mr. Sundaram and they've done an excellent job of identifying what are the attributes of the CEO as well as systematically meeting many prospective candidates both internal and external. So I think that process is going well. I would hesitate to give you a timeline for this, because as you know this has \u2013 there are many steps in it, but you know I think I'm satisfied that the process is being done thoroughly and we can take it to closure in a reasonable amount of time.", "In terms of the person itself, I think we have prepared a ideal list of attributes and we'll have to take it as it comes and obviously knowledge of the software would certainly be one attribute, but there are other attributes too, as you think about it, because it's about leadership, it's about transformation of an organization, it's about customer connect, so lots of dimensions that we've identified in our search.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Got it. Okay. And then it sounds like the strategies to maximize the digital opportunities, while increasing productivity on the maintenance side. Is that still the case and if it is, that strategy is fairly similar to some of your competitors. So I'm wondering, how your strategy you feel differs from those competitors? Thanks.", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "Well, I'd \u2013 yeah. First of all I think, you know, that, that aspect of strategy, which is increasing your share of revenue from new high growth services which are in demand and automating your traditional services, I mean that, there is no other strategy, that's the only thing that large services companies have to do. The question is, A, how well you can execute on that, how well you are able to reposition yourself to be considered as a provider of new services, how well you are able automation in both the old and the new? How well you're able to reskill and reinvent your people to be able to deal with this challenge and so on? That's where the real challenge is, not in the \u2013 it's not in the 2/2 metrics or something.", "At the same time, I think because of our investment in NIA, we think that \u2013 and with certain tweaks on NIA, because there are certain things \u2013 and I'm doing another review of it on Monday. I think there are a lot of good elements. There are some things we have to do differently. So we will look at doing that. So I think the fact that we have invested in a AI platform using latest open source components, which have built in machine learning, data extraction, data analytics tools, I think gives us a serious competitive advantage, which we have to take it to the next level to realize those benefits, but that's what we're committing to doing now. So, I think the broad strategy, which is automate the old and build high growth new services, that everybody will have. How well you execute and how well you have built the intellectual assets to do it, that is going to be the differentiator.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd.", "Hi. Thanks for explaining your strategic initiatives. I'm kind of trying to approach it from a slightly different angle here. There were two elements that we had to the software plus services model. One was to kind of build software in-house through a set of people, many of whom have left the company in the last say 12 months. The second was M&A, and I did hear you talk about potentially accelerating that, but one, given where things are today, how do you think we can get this strategy back on track? That's first part of my question.", "And second, I think well, the ideal is to kind of build a software plus services model. This is something that we've heard from services companies, including Infosys in the last several years and success in this has somehow been elusive. What do you think that we need to do differently this time to kind of succeed in actually building a successful software plus services model?", "Nandan M. Nilekani - Infosys Ltd.", "I think, not only the strategy is on track, what you will see is an acceleration of what we're doing. So I don't agree with this not being on track kind of thing. We have ample talent. We have people who have experience in building these things. Many of the projects we are doing today use these sophisticated approaches, the GSTN architecture is state-of-the-art. So I think we have a lot of capability and I have no doubt that our people will be able to do that. So I'm very comfortable that the strategy is on track, and if \u2013 and anything we're going to accelerate this whole thing.", "On the other thing, finally it boils down to how well you can execute. I mean, how well do you articulate your value proposition, how well your build the software plus service approach, how well you solve the internal problem, so everybody is aligned, how well you reskill your people, et cetera, et cetera. So I think finally, it boils down to how well you execute. And I'm confident that Infosys with its ability to execute along with a CEO, who I'm sure will provide the right leadership, will be able to do this transformation in the next \u2013 in the coming years.", "Diviya Nagarajan - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I now hand the floor back to the management for further proceedings of the conference call. Over to you, sir. Thank you.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "Thanks, Nandhan. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this call. I'll give you a brief update on our quarter two performance. As you're aware, quarter two saw significant changes in the company, at the management and board level. We responded quickly to these changes through proactive communication with all stakeholders, including clients and employees. This ensured that the impact on the business in quarter two was minimal. We continued our steadfast focus on the execution, leading to a satisfactory performance in quarter two. Our revenues grew sequentially by 2.9% on reported dollar basis and 2.2% on constant currency basis.", "We saw growth in all the four large verticals and delivered strong growth in emerging verticals like Energy and Utilities, Life Sciences, Transportation and Logistics. Volumes grew by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter, realization grew 1.3% quarter-on-quarter on reported basis and 0.7% on a constant currency basis. Both on a year-on-year basis, as well H1 over H1 of fiscal 2017, realization was flat in the constant currency that terms, reflecting stability in pricing environment, as well as continuous improvement in our service mix towards higher value offerings.", "In terms of service offerings, we had notably strong growth in infrastructure management, testing, and BPO services. Our new offerings in areas like cybersecurity, cloud, big data, IoT, et cetera again contributed to approximately half of incremental growth in quarter two, thereby improving their share further to 9.4% of revenues from 8.3% last quarter.", "We had another quarter of extremely strong operational efficiencies during the quarter. Utilization excluding and including trainees, reached the all-time high levels of 84.7% and 81.8%. Onsite, offshore mix improved during the quarter by 0.7%. Revenue per FTE improved to $52,684, which is a growth of 1.5% quarter-on-quarter and 3.3% year-on-year. Attrition increased marginally to 17.2% on a standalone basis and 21.4% on a consolidated basis. Effective July, we gave compensation increase to 85% of our eligible employee population in India. Effective October, we have also rolled out compensation review for middle management employees across India and some overseas markets. The compensation review programs for senior management and leadership levels and other overseas locations is currently in progress.", "During the quarter, we won five large deals with a TCV of $731 million, both the TCV of deal wins and share of new deals improved over quarter one 2018. For our software-led offerings in quarter two, Infosys NIA, our flagship AI and automation platform continued its positive momentum driving several deal wins. The platform has been leveraged across diverse business solutions, including loan onboarding, fraud management, demand sensing, predictive costing, contract compliance and procurement automation. We are working with more than 100 clients on close to 200 engagements and see tremendous potential for the platform and business solutions going forward.", "Coming to some of the verticals, in Financial Services, growth in quarter two was in line with our expectation. We expect seasonal softness in quarter three, driven by furloughs and spending cuts. On a mid-longer term basis, however, we remain optimistic about tech spend in BFSI and our strong competitive position, which is reflected in our large deal wins as well as pipeline.", "Manufacturing vertical is seeing some in-sourcing and cost optimization initiatives by a few clients. There is some pickup in activity in ERP space, driven by M&A in the sector in the last 12 to 18 months. High-tech companies are changing their business models to capture new sources of revenue.", "In Retail and CPG, non-discretionary spend are being impacted due to slowing growth, leading to cost pressures. On discretionary spend and new technology adoption, there is growing interest to embrace digital AI, RPA, analytics, et cetera. Telecom is seeing significant industry consolidation to achieve diversified product offerings and monetize the network traffic in a better way.", "Coming to digital, clients are looking at renewing their legacy landscapes and investing in customer experience, new commerce models, and in digitally connecting the enterprise. Digital experience, content management, field force management and digital marketing are some of the key trends we are witnessing across verticals. Retail and financial services industries are leading the transformation towards digital and are looking at consolidation of services, automation, improved customer experience and eliminating supply chain issues.", "This quarter, we further strengthened our digital expertise with the acquisition of Brilliant Basics, a London-based digital innovation and customer experience studio known for its world-class design thinking-led approach and experience in executing global programs.

Foundation supported training of over 1,000 teachers at various locations across U.S.", "Coming to guidance, based on our performance in first half of the year and seasonal softness that we typically see in H2, we have revised our revenue guidance to 5.5% to 6.5% in constant currency terms.", "I will now pass on to Ranga to talk about the financial highlights.", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Infosys Ltd.", "Thank you, Pravin. Hello, everyone. Pravin has talked about overall stability on multiple dimensions. At the outset, I would like to highlight three key aspects of the quarter. These are; first, broad-based improvement in operational efficiency parameters; second, healthy and stable operating margin, net margin and EPS growth; and third, steps taken towards implementation of capital allocation policy.", "Our relentless focus on improving operational efficiency parameters continued to yield results in this quarter. We had continued improvement in multiple operational efficiency parameters like utilization percent, onsite mix percent, revenue productivity per employee, onsite employee cost as percentage of revenue, total employee cost as percentage of revenue, leading to a healthy and stable operating margin. Our operating margin for the quarter was steady at 24.2%. I'll be providing more details on this shortly. Net margin improved to 21.2% compared to 20.4% last quarter.", "Coming to capital allocation policy, several steps were taken during the quarter. As you are aware, during the quarter, the board approved the buyback of equity shares of the company amounting to INR 13,000 crores, approximately US$2 billion. Shareholder approval for the buyback of equity shares was obtained through a postal ballot and a public announcement was made on October 10, 2017 on buyback of equity shares. Draft Letter of Offer for the buyback has been filed with the regulators for their comments.", "The company announced today an interim dividend of INR 13 per share, approximately $0.20 per ADS as compared to an interim dividend of INR 11 per share announced last year. As announced earlier, the record date for both buyback and interim dividend is November 1, 2017.", "Now let me talk about revenues. Our revenues for the quarter were US$2,728 million. This is a sequential growth of 2.9% in dollar terms and 2.2% in constant currency terms. In rupee terms, revenues for the quarter were INR 17,567 crores. This is a sequential growth of 2.9%.", "As compared to Q2 of last year, revenues grew 5.4% in dollar terms, 4.6% in constant currency and 1.5% in rupee terms. When we compare rupee grow \u2013 revenue growth in half year, that is H1 2018 revenue as compared to H1 2017, the revenue growth was 5.7% in dollar terms and 5.5% in constant currency terms and 1.6% in rupee terms.", "Sequential volume growth for the quarter was 1.6%. As compared to Q2 of last year, volume growth was 4.7%. Pricing realization on a sequential basis improved by 1.3% in reported terms and 0.7% in constant currency terms. On a year-over-year basis for H1 of this year as compared to H1 of last year, which is a better comparison, pricing realization was flat.", "Revenue per employee improved further this quarter to US$52,684, a sequential growth of 1.5% and year-on-year growth of 3.3%. While our revenues grew 5.7% in H1 this year as compared to H1 of last year, the net head count declined by 0.7% during the same period. This is primarily on account of lower net head count addition due to higher utilization and productivity improvements.", "We ended the quarter with a total head count of 198,440, which is a decrease of 113 from last quarter. During H1 of this year, the net head count decreased by 1,224 employees as compared to a net addition of 5,785 employees in H1 of last year.", "Coming to operational efficiencies, utilization excluding trainees increased further to an all-time high of 84.7% as compared to 82.5% in Q2 of last year. You would recall that the utilization has been consistently above 80% for the last 10 quarters in a row.", "Efforts towards moderation in onsite mix has led to onsite mix decreasing to 29.4% in Q2, which is the lowest level in the last eight quarters. Onsite mix stood at 30.1% last quarter. Our focus on optimizing onsite employee cost, including a sharper focus on productivity, onsite pyramid and other cost optimization measures led to a decrease in employee cost as a percentage of revenue from 54.4% in Q2 this year from 55.4% in Q2 last year, a drop of 1%.", "Subcontractor costs as a percentage of revenue was 6.2% this quarter as compared to 6.3% last quarter. Subcontractor expenses are driven primarily by higher utilization and onsite talent demand.", "Our operating margin for Q2 2018 is at 24.2%, which increased sequentially by 10 basis points. Reduction in onsite mix helped margins by 20 basis points, improvement in utilization helped margins by 30 basis points, while improvement in price realization helped margins by another 30 basis points. However, this was offset by higher compensation costs due to compensation review in Q2 and higher variable pay, which put together impacted margins by 80 basis points.", "Other benefits including cross currency and cost optimization was partially offset by increase in provision for AR, increase in professional charges and impact of hedges, resulting in 10 basis points improvement as compared to Q1.", "Our earnings per share for the quarter was $0.25 representing a sequential growth of 7%, and a year-on-year growth of 7.3%. In rupee terms, EPS was at INR 16.30, showing a sequential growth of 7% and a year-on-year growth of 3.2%. Due to continued healthy cash generation, cash and cash equivalents including investments stood at an all-time high of US$6,340 million, which converts to INR 41,392 crores. As mentioned earlier, planned outlay for buyback is up to INR 13,000 crores, which approximately is US$2 billion. Further, outlay for interim dividend to be paid out during the quarter is US$524 million, including dividend distribution tax.", "Cash provided from operating activities as per consolidated IFRS was US$441 million and INR 2,831 crores. DSO for the quarter increased to 71 days as compared to 68 days last quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $63 million or approximately INR 406 crores.", "In H1 2018, operating cash flow increased by 8% in dollar terms and 3.6% in rupee terms. Free cash flow increased by 19.1% in dollar terms and 14.3% in rupee terms. Yield on cash for the quarter was 6.97%, as compared to 7.07% last quarter. Our hedge position as of September 30, 2017, was $1.4 billion. We reiterate our FY 2018 operating margin in the range of 23% to 25%.", "With that, we'll open the floor for questions.", "Question and Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. We have first question from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.", "James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna International Group", "Thanks for taking my question. Good evening. I'll just \u2013 I'm going to ask two upfront. One more strategic and one more financial. The first one is for Pravin, a more strategic. Pravin, could you comment in your opinion about how you view the relative strength of offshore versus onsite delivery at this stage in development of the company and the industry? That's the first one.", "And then Ranga, I'll just ask you a upfront. Thank you for the incremental disclosures. They were very helpful. I want to ask you about the commentary that you made with regard to the onsite pyramid. How should we be thinking about the journey of onsite costs as a percentage of total costs going forward? So the first one onsite offshore strategy and the second one were onsite offshore financials. Thank you.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "In my mind, I don't think there is any difference between an onsite or a offshore thing. Typically, whenever a new service gets incubated and wherever it calls for a lot more understanding of the market or domain in which the service is being evolved are much more client interface, we do see lot more of onsite presence, where people are working closely with the clients in a co-creation mode and developing the solution. But once the technology matures or when the solution matures, then the opportunities for scaling and that's where you typically leverage your onsite and offshore model as well.", "So, I don't really see too much difference, both have a role to play. And also \u2013 there is also this element of talent and skill, I mean, today when you look at in-sourcing, lot of clients setting up their captives in India. The primary reason they're doing is not for on the cost perspective but more from a talent availability perspective, and that we continue to see on an ongoing basis.", "So it's \u2013 I'm not sure whether I really understood your question. But from our perspective, we work on a global delivery model, where there is a seamless integration between onsite and offshore, and depending on the services, the nature of work done onsite and the nature of work done offshore is also clearly distinct. Apart from that I don't see a much difference. I mean, there are times in the project lifecycle or in the service evolution stage you may have stronger onsite presence, but over a period of time, anything \u2013 we believe that anything can be executed in the onsite/offshore model.", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Infosys Ltd.", "Hi. Thanks, Pravin. On the other point, currently our onsite employee cost as a percentage of revenue is around 38%. I think the focus on the pyramid is \u2013 coming back to the pyramid question is really on how do we kind of look at the pyramid model onsite. For example, we recruited close to 300 people from the Euro universities, the freshers, and how do we infuse some of them into some of these projects is one aspect of looking at it.", "And the second one is also looking at the fixed price projects, due to the productivity improvements et cetera, how do we look at especially the senior roles in those projects and how do we kind of redeploy them in some other projects is another way to look at it.", "And the third aspect is also, we're evaluating the dollar contribution per employee at the senior roles and see is there a concomitant increase in the billing rates to reflect the underlying salary costs. And if that is not there in a particular project, could we look at that employee, senior employee getting billed at a better rate in another project either in the same client or a different client. I think we are looking at multiple approaches to this. At this point in time, I think there is no one lever we need to press and looking at all this. But one point that we want to ensure is that, we don't want to look at onsite remedy in isolation and it should not be looked in isolation to the revenue opportunities that we have onsite, I think we need to have a delicate balance between the two.", "James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna International Group", "Okay. Thank you for the details and the perspective. All the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Elara Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "Thank you for the opportunity. So first question is about the realization improvement. You saw a nice increase in fixed price projects, as well, is this the key factor that has helped realization and should we say that the realization improvement is sustainable except for factors like fewer working days in Q3?", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Infosys Ltd.", "I think, you know, you're right. In the \u2013 this quarter of course, we had sequential pricing realization improvement of 1.3%. I think quarter-to-quarter, there is always volatility depending upon the \u2013 there are also certain projects, the recognition pattern is not really linear. But however, overall, I think a better indicator would be really on the year-on-year growth, how has the pricing performed. If you look at first half of this year as compared to first half of last year, we have seen a flat pricing in terms of pricing, which is also in a ways kind of as compared to earlier periods, typically, we used to have in terms of constant currency 1% to 1.5% decline in pricing year-on-year. But this half year versus last half year, it has been flat, to that extent, it is stable.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "And what would you say would be your optimal onsite, offshore effort mix? And you've already lowered the onsite ratio a little, do you think there is room to go further or do you think we are pretty much close to an optimal level already?", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Infosys Ltd.", "I think the way we look at onsite mix is really by service level, right. I think certain services are more amenable for onsite mix reduction, for example, some of the commoditized services like testing, for example or maintenance, for example, are more amenable. But some of the new services like the digital user experience, the agile or prototyping kind of work typically have a larger onsite competency, similarly consulting will have and so on.", "Our approach has been to see by a service line and this quarter from \u2013 it was 29.4% from the high of 30.2% last quarter, which is low in the last eight quarters. In the past, we've had about three years ago or so, we've had the on-site mix at 27%, around 27%. But it's not to say that look \u2013 that is what we'll immediately aim for et cetera. But I think this is a continuous journey that we have to focus on, service line by service line focus and see, where are the opportunities. I think it's really a grounds up exercise rather than the top-down exercise.", "Ravi Menon - Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shekhar Singh from Excelsyor Capital. Please go ahead.", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "It was more related to the strategy, which Nandan outlined. Now if you talk of product type services, then what is the parameter or as investors that we should track now going forward, to see what is the sort of investment which is happening in this area and what is the outcome of it? And secondly, who will be a new competition as such?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "See, on the software product type services, the parameters, I mean, some part of the product type services, we will probably be looking at more going into a SaaS kind of model. So, one of the parameters should be of, in terms of only for that piece of it, the amount of subscription revenue kind of thing. But today, as a percentage, it is very small percentage of the business, so at this stage, it may not make too much sense to track or have any inference around it, because given the small size, you will continue to have some volatility.", "But in the long-term, I think that would be probably the better measure from a product type services perspective. But in the short-term, I think, I mean, we continue to talk about the number of wins we have had, number of deals and that percentage of revenue contribution from software and that at least in the short-term to medium-term till we have some scale may be a better measure.", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "And sir, just in terms of like, say, when we talk of products or product type services, software plus service, there are two things which again come to mind, one is, are we targeting any vertical or is it going to be more like a horizontal?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "No, NIA is a horizontal platform, but we are really building vertical solutions on top of it. So, going forward, that will be the differentiator, because at some level, over a period of time, you will always have competing horizontal platform, difficult to monetize a horizontal platform beyond a particular point in time. Our view is to build vertical solutions on top of it and as I said earlier, we have seen some interesting use cases around fraud management, procurement optimization and so on using NIA. So more and more we do use cases across different verticals, we'll be able to get a better appreciation of the kind of use cases that it lends itself and it's in much in demand in those verticals and we'll be able to make it as part of our product going forward.", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "Okay. And sir, lastly like can you give say any example of which company or which competitor of yours is what you'll look like maybe five years later or 10 years later with this change of the strategy?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "I think we'll be Infosys plus-plus or whatever, so I don't think -", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "Yeah, sure.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "I mean, the landscape is changing, the competitive...", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "Correct.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "...I mean nature of competition is changing, so it's difficult to predict. I don't think we tailor ourselves on any competition or anything. We have our own strategy. We continuously look at how we can differentiate from others and execution is a key element of it, because at a high level, more strategies may look similar, but at the end of the day, it boils down to execution. Our focus is more on making sure we do the right things in terms of execution. I mean, we will probably be Infosys plus-plus, but I don't think we'll be \u2013 we'll be aping or copying any...", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "Yeah.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "...competitor out there.", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "No, basically, I wanted like something like Salesforce or something like SAP?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "No. I don't \u2013 I mean, both are in \u2013 SAP is a purely product, I think Salesforce is in some sense a software-as-a-service kind of thing, SAP is also morphing into it. We are more a services company whose services is enabled by software, so that is our difference. So, I don't think we should compare ourselves with an SAP or a Salesforce.", "Shekhar Singh - Excelsyor Capital", "Perfect. Great, sir. Congrats.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Please go ahead. David, you may go ahead with your question, please. As there is no response from the line of David, we'll move to the next question, that's from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Hey, thanks. This is a question for Ranga. Can you talk a bit about what's left in terms of some of the levers for sustaining your EBIT margin range? And you've done a really good job in terms of getting some of those benefits, but what can we expect for the next three to five years? Thanks.", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Infosys Ltd.", "Hi, Moshe. How are you? I think, if you recollect last eight quarters or nine quarters, we have been pretty much in this band between 23% to 25%, that has been the band \u2013 steady band that we have kept. There have been despite the pricing challenges and some currency and other \u2013 the compensation hikes and many other headwinds. I think this year, we clearly said it will be in 23% to 25%, because we have to invest in the U.S. talent model and so on. I think we \u2013 our focus always has been without diluting the business investments, without diluting securing our future whatever we need to do, what is the cost optimization that we need to do without hurting the business, that is both in the short-term and the medium-term, that has been our focus.", "Now if you look at the first two quarters and the half year, we're pretty much at 24.1%, which is the midpoint of 23% to 25%. In the short-term, I think, especially for fiscal 2018, we're comfortable in this range and as you know, the multiple levers, of course, the utilization is already at 84.7%. So I think the headway there is shorter than the other levers. We are looking at in a overall project plus, a project kind of approach, project focused cost optimization aggregating to our account level and then to the company level, the unit level and the account and the unit and the company level.", "If you look at the levers, I was alluding to earlier or referring to earlier, one is certainly we're looking at the onsite pyramid and over the last couple of quarters, we have seen some improvement there, including the hiring of about 300 to 350 fresh graduates in the United States from the campus as part of an American hiring program. And they're also getting very quickly deployed into the production projects. So that is one lever, which we want to kind of further optimize.", "And the second one as I was saying earlier in the fixed price projects, we are really looking at per employee dollar contribution at the senior levels and see whether it is concomitant to the billing rates that they're getting charged in that products and try to see how much of that could be realized at the higher level.", "Onsite mix is one which has both sides of the equation right, and typically when the onsite mix comes down drastically, it could have impact on the revenue because onsite revenue to offset $1 \u2013 on onsite, we need to kind of have three times the effort of offshore and so on. But there again, a judicious approach would be to look at the service level, some of the services are more amenable like testing and maintenance rather than consulting and some digital services.", "So, we're kind of looking at instead of saying that look, this is the only rework that we will do, we are looking at a project level approach aggregated to an account level approach, because each account profile and possibilities are different. So, each of the account managers and leaders have been tasked to be looking at this from all the three dimensions. Some of them probably could be using the pyramid lever more than the onsite mixed lever, some of them \u2013 someone else could be using an another lever. So we're kind of looking at. But to answer your question, I think in the short-term, we're comfortable with this band.", "Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Understood. And then just also very briefly in your opening remarks, you spoke about account specific softness, and as one of the reasons you've reset guidance for the second half of the year. Can you elaborate on that maybe some color on verticals, that'll be helpful. Thank you.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "Moshe, this is Pravin here. We didn't talk about any account specific softness. What we said is historically in quarter three, for the industry itself, it's a soft quarter. We have lesser working days. We have the impact of furloughs and so on. So it's nothing account specific or sector specific, the impact we typically see across all verticals. So that's what we meant.", "And from a guidance perspective, we looked at our performance in H1, then we looked at \u2013 I mean typical softness that we typically see in H2, we kept that in mind and looking at our own pipeline. And that is the basis on which we gave our estimates. I will just pass it on to couple of our presidents to give some color on the verticals. We'll have Mohit give some color on Financial Services and Ravi can also give some color on this, from a service line perspective.", "Mohit Joshi - Infosys Ltd.", "Thanks, Pravin. So, Moshe, I think, look, from a Financial Services perspective, as you'll see from the numbers, we had a good quarter. Especially in Insurance, we really had a knockout quarter this time around. And overall, I'm very happy with the progress that we made in terms of organic growth, in terms of traction in AI and automation software, new client acquisition. We added 13 new clients in the Financial Services space. We signed one \u2013 one of these account openings was a large deal, right. So we opened an account through a $50 million-plus deal.", "So that was good. I think, as Pravin mentioned, the second half of the year is a seasonally weak period for us. We see furloughs across the board, including in Financial Services. And there will be \u2013 as has been there in the previous years, end of the year budget squeezes for some clients, right. So we have tried to bake all of that into our guidance for the second half of the year. But as of today, if you see our performance for Q1 and Q2, it's been strong in the Financial Services, Healthcare, Life Sciences, across the board. And we are very comfortable with our competitive positioning, right. So, this does not \u2013 the guidance that we've given in no way reflects the fact that we are slipping. We feel that our competitive position is very strong in Financial Services, Healthcare, Life Sciences, and actually improving.", "Ravi Kumar S. - Infosys Ltd.", "Yeah. So I'm going to give you a cut on the services. Our new services, as you've seen in the fact sheets, has moved from 8.3% of revenues to 9.4%. So that's a reflection of how much wallet share we're gaining in the digital transformation agenda of our clients. It's an indication of how well we are doing on these newer areas. And a lot of it is pivoted on digital experience, API economy, cybersecurity, cloud migration services, enterprises cloud applications, Internet of Things, and data and analytics. These are the broad categories of where the new services are. We would see a significant growth in new services as we go forward and we hope that the percentage of our revenues continues to go up on it.", "Specifically, on the service lines, we had an extraordinary quarter for Business Process Management. In fact, we are powering it with a digital focus, re-imagining process experience, powered by innovation and automation. So that's taken off very well. Infrastructure Services has grown significantly this quarter. And this is a significant part of what clients are doing on migrating workloads to the cloud.", "So, overall, these are the areas where we are seeing great traction and in line with client spend.", "Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Ashish Chopra from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.", "Ashish Chopra - Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd.", "Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Pravin, firstly, just wanted to understand in the new services that you call out and divided into five or six service lines. Would it be fair to assume that a biggest chunk of that is really the cloud ecosystem bit and the others would be relatively small? Where I'm really coming from is the coinciding of the revenue contribution from there with the growth in IMS that we've seen in the last couple of quarters.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "Yeah. So not really, I \u2013 cloud is an important part of the journey. In fact, a majority of the digital transformation agenda is driven by CapEx to OpEx shift of workloads, and migrating to the cloud is a fairly big part of the digital transformation agenda of clients.", "However, all the other areas, which I spoke about, are picking significant traction. API economy is an important part of a digital agenda, as you expose legacy applications and legacy systems for newer purposes. Internet of Things is very early, but it has a small installed base, but we all know that unstructured data around physical objects, machines is going to be the future. So it's going to pick momentum in the future, but it's a small installed base, most customers are experimenting, they're prototyping, they are platformizing their unstructured data, which is there between machines. So that has a runway I would say.", "Data and analytics is very mainstream now. It's probably all pervasive across industries, across domains. We see a huge traction out there. Enterprise cloud applications is the next big thing. A majority of our clients are moving from on-premise to \u2013 transitioning to enterprise cloud applications, either on their existing stacks like Oracle, SAP, or moving into new areas like salesforce.com, Workday kind of application, so Microsoft Dynamics. Dynamics has actually now come up with Dynamics 365.", "So, I would say there is a fraction in all quarters. Digital experience, the front-end of all the digital agenda \u2013 all the digital spend for our clients, while a significant chunk of it is in retail, but all the other industries are picking up momentum there as well. And so, there is, overall, quite a bit in areas which are not related to cloud migration as well.", "Ashish Chopra - Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd.", "Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And just lastly from my side, I had a question on the strategy shared earlier during the day. So just wanted to understand that while we've identified the areas of focus and the fact that execution obviously is the imperative, could you share the readiness or the glaring gaps across various pockets where you think that the need to \u2013 the challenges perhaps could be higher, could be the DevOps ready workforce, could be Automation or on the sales front maybe around Consulting-led Design Thinking-led sales, or maybe the business models around the whole product plus software services offerings? Really, where would you think we are really ready to hit the ground running versus where we still would have to really focus on building capabilities sooner rather than later?", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "So, I think from a services perspective when we look at services strategy, there are many areas where we have started making progress, and scaling that is in our DNA and we are extremely comfortable with it. We have always invested in education, learning, re-skilling and so on. So, there I think it's more a question of sharpening the focus rather than going after 20 different things, sharpening the focus, identify a few things and put your might in terms of scaling it.", "On the software side and the product services side, right now, we are seeing good traction and adoption from a horizontal capability perspective, but I think the future is if you're able to bring in vertical solutions on top of it. And that is where we are probably in the early stages and that's where we would probably need to accelerate our focus.", "Ashish Chopra - Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd.", "Got it. That's helpful, Pravin. Thanks and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jay Doshi from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.", "Kawaljeet Saluja - Kotak Securities Ltd.", "Yeah. Hi. Pravin, I'm not absolutely clear on the rationale for guidance cut. Is it largely the deterioration in demand environment or is it the function of CEO exit and the consequent deduction that we have seen in the last few months?", "The second question I have is largely on the chain side of a business, which is platform, product, automation. A lot of these areas were handled by a team which was brought onboard by Vishal, and many of them have exited the company. So how is the management thinking about these exits? Are the rolls being reassigned internally? Are you referring to recruit externally? Just some thought around it.", "And finally, has there been any fine-tuning of the organization structure after Vishal's exit? And if yes, then can you just detail the key changes?", "By the way, this is Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "Yeah. Thanks. So I will answer the last part first. There has been no organization or structural changes since Vishal left, so that's the easy one. The first part is the guidance is nothing to do with Vishal's exit. Guidance is actually based on \u2013 and we have always said it's based on what we see. If we look at our first half performance, we took that into account, we looked at our pipeline, we looked at the visibility and we also kept in mind, the typical softness we see in quarter three for us and rest of the industry, and in particular for us, in particular in quarter four, if we look back over the last few years, we have always for whatever reason had very minimal growth. So, we kept all this factors in mind and that's how we arrived at the guidance.", "The other data point you need to recognize is, I mean when we look at our own quarter-on-quarter \u2013 on the constant currency basis, based on whatever our peers have declared so far, our growth has been much higher and our growth on -in quarter one, as well on a constant currency basis has been higher, when compared to many of our peers. But if we look at historically, as a quarter two typically would have been a good quarter for the industry, but for whatever reason, this year, it seems to be a little bit unusual. Not only our growth, but our competition growth in quarter two has also been on a much lower side. So all these factors in some sense contributed to our revised estimate on the guidance and while we'll continue to endeavor to do better than the guidance, but I mean, today based on the reality, we felt that would be the appropriate one at this stage.", "Kawaljeet Saluja - Kotak Securities Ltd.", "Okay. And just some thoughts around the chain side sort of the business, the consequent exits that you have seen on the leadership side on that count and are you trying to replace that with external recruits or have the roles been reassigned internally? And just some thoughts around it? I guess that's the question I asked.", "U. B. Pravin Rao - Infosys Ltd.", "Yeah. See, I mean if you look at that the key people \u2013 some of the key people who left, we had Sanjay, who was heading our \u2013 what we call as a Corporate Design Group, but he used to handle multiple functions. So, we have redistributed the responsibility to appropriate people, who are already doing part of that function. So for instance, while Sanjay was earlier associated with Design Thinking, but subsequently we have very strong Design Thinking Practice, it is now integral to our Consulting Practice. And even our It is now integral to our consulting practice and even our ETA team are trained to teach people, Design Thinking, and our Consulting have always been using Design Thinking in their Consulting Services, particularly in the early stages of the Lifecycle. So that's all has always been integrated and mainstream, so we have not had any issues there.", "Sanjay was also responsible for our Corporate Design Group, with now we have \u2013 he's reporting to our marketing function and Sanjay was also responsible for some parts of the large deal, design and element of the large deal process, now that we have folded into our large deal group which earlier used to report to Mohit. So we have \u2013 I mean, Sanjay used to manage multiple things at a very high level. So we have been able to take pieces of it and logically assign it to where it made sense.", "On the product side, who had Pervinder who had joined us a few months back as CEO on the EdgeVerve side. He also \u2013 he left recently. He wanted to go back to his entrepreneurial roots, so there we have brought in Nitesh Banga, who is a \u2013 he's a 20-year veteran in Infosys, but most importantly, he has been integral to our product strategy from the beginning. He was part of earlier Product & Platform Group, which we formed during Shibu's reign and subsequently when EdgeVerve was formed much before Vishal came into onboard, he was part of it, he was heading the sales for Edge.", "And so we have brought him onboard as CEO, because we believe at least on the Interim CEO, because he brings in the context and he has been the most vocal champion and has been driving and pushing the software services that we have so far. We felt he would be the right person.", "So and for people like Abdul and Navin, the people under them are still part of Infosys, we've a strong team. So it's a mixed thing. So we have had a few exits, but we have been able to quickly replace them with very minimal impact.", "Kawaljeet Saluja - Kotak Securities Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you. All the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Mehta - Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "Yeah, hi. Thanks for the opportunity. I had one question in terms of salary hikes. So are the onsite salary hikes done? And you indicated the middle management salary hikes would be given out in the next quarter. So if you can quantify the impacts of the residual salary hikes?", "Ranganath D. Mavinakere - Infosys Ltd.", "I think, you know, if you look at the salary hikes, we clearly said for junior employees up to mid-level, we will do effective July, which we rolled out and afterwards, all the operational efficiency improvements this quarter went into funding and most of the compensation hikes for mid-level to senior. I think we have covered most of the employees. Onsite, typically, we have people moving from here, there and it is also driven by the location preference \u2013 location of a employee, especially people in the production.", "So, they're all governed by, for ex \u2013 the prevailing wages as well as when they move from one project to another. For example, if somebody moves from Chicago to California, automatically, this salary get rebased to the California salary. So, there I think the primary focus is really the engagement driven, the location driven, and so on. However, for the senior employees there from sales, consulting and others, we are clearly effecting that to effective January of this year. So I think with that, we would have covered all the employees.", "Ashwin Mehta - Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "Okay. Fair enough. And just one follow-up on the BFSI side. We've actually seen BFS portions decelerate for you, while insurance has been pretty while insurance has been pretty strong. Do you see further runway in terms of insurance continuing to compensate for the BFS slowdown? What exactly is driving the insurance uptake for you?", "Mohit Joshi - Infosys Ltd.", "Well, I think look, the insurance business is relatively small for us. So we have a lot of headroom for growth. There is a degree of anti-incumbency in that sector as \u2013 and that gives us an opportunity. I think we've also been very strategic about entering the insurance space, not with standard sort of legacy solutions, but using the opportunity to let us say, work with clients to imagine the future of a Claims Administration System or reimage the building of a policy administration platform. We've worked with a number of startups and new players in this space who are taking creative solutions to clients.", "So I think we have a really well thought out strategy, and I believe that we will have headroom for growth in that business. We also have a platform there in terms of McCamish. We have strong BPO capabilities, emerging consulting capabilities, so I'm quite bullish about the future of that business.", "Our Core Banking and Capital Markets Business also is I believe quite strong. Obviously, there are variations that happen from quarter-to-quarter in that business. This quarter because the Banking and Capital Markets number also includes the Finacle number, and from previous quarters, there that business is slightly lumpy. So the number also appears to be slightly lower because of a negative impact of Finacle. Hopefully, that answers your question. If you'd like any additional color, I'm happy to provide that.", "Ashwin Mehta - Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities (India) Pvt Ltd.", "No. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Mohit Joshi - Infosys Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I now handover the floor back to Sandeep Mahindroo for his closing comments. Over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo - Infosys Ltd.", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call. We look forward to talking to you again during the quarter. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us. And you may now disconnect your lines."]}

Thank you, and over to you, sir.", "Sandeep Mahindroo", "Thanks, Karuna. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Infosys\u2019 earnings call to discuss Q3 FY 2018 results. Let me start by wishing everyone a very Happy New Year. I\u2019m Sandeep from the Investor Relations team in Bangalore. Joining us today on this call is Mr. Nandan Nilekani, Non-Executive Chairman; Mr. Salil Parekh, CEO and MD; Mr. Pravin Rao, COO; Mr. M. D. Ranganath; CFO; Presidents and the other members of the management team.", "We\u2019ll start the call with some remarks from Mr. Nandan Nilekani, subsequent to which we\u2019ll open up the call for questions on the areas covered by him. We\u2019ll then transfer the call to the management team for some remarks on the quarter, subsequent to which we\u2019ll open up the call again for some more questions.", "Please note that anything which we say, which refers to our outlook for the future is a forward-looking statement, which must be read in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. A full statement and explanation of these risks is available in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on www.sec.gov.", "I\u2019d now like to pass it on to Mr. Nilekani.", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thank you, Sandeep, and it\u2019s a great pleasure to be here on this call. I want to make some brief opening remarks from the Board and then I\u2019ll hand over to Salil. As you know, Mr. Salil Parekh joined us as CEO and MD of the company from Jan 2. And it\u2019s barely been 10 days since he has joined and he has already taken full charge of what has to be done. So it\u2019s great to have him on Board. And we all confident that under his leadership, this company will scale new heights.", "I also want to thank Pravin Rao, who did a great job stepping in on August 18, and making sure everything was running well, and he continues as the Chief Operating Officer.", "The appointment of Salil has been put to approval of shareholders with a postal ballot, which has gone out. I also want to deeply thank Rajesh Murthy, President, who resigned from the Board for personal reasons. He has personal challenges that require him to be based in Paris for a longer time.", "So given the travel he was dealing with, he wants to move on and we appreciate that. And we all want to place a deep appreciation for his commitment in Infosys for the last 26 years. I had the privilege of hiring him into Infosys in October 1991. And he has been a pillar of this company and he\u2019s a great, warm, large-hearted individual who has always done best for the company, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.", "We also had created sometime back something called as a Committee of Directors consisting of Mr. Ravi Venkatesan and Mr. D. N. Prahlad, to assist the CEO in discharging his responsibilities. Now with the arrival of Salil, who is full-time focused right here in Bangalore, the need for this committee is not necessary anymore. So the Committee of Directors is dissolved with effect from today.", "Also, on August 24, we had mentioned that we would be doing a shareholder consultation. And this consultation process has been conducted. Many of you may have been approached by our people either in person or through the level thing. And we have got very, very comprehensive, very, very useful feedback from the shareholders. So the Board has taken that feedback on record and we\u2019ll endeavor to continue to provide information and transparency that \u2013 as expected by the shareholders.", "There are two things I want to also talk about. I think, we have just successfully completed the share buyback. And I think, I want to give my congratulations to our CFO, Mr. Ranganath and his team for having done a very complex exercise of doing a buyback across a company listed in four different exchanges in the Europe, in the U.S., in India, and I think doing it on schedule, on time, so the buyback has been very successful.", "And I also want to congratulate the finance team and Mr. Dhareshwar, who have done a great job in signing the Advance Pricing Agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. And this again, is part of a series of actions that are done on the tax front, which I think will hold \u2013 will help this company greatly. So I\u2019m sure, the finance team will take this forward elsewhere and it\u2019s a great job.", "And finally, I do want to congratulate the whole management team this quarter, of course, performance has been very good. And as you all know, December is a difficult quarter because there are a lot of furloughs and leave and people are in holiday mood and Christmas parties and all that stuff. And in that to deliver on the revenue, to deliver on collections is a great contribution of people under Pravin\u2019s leadership; Ravikumar, President; Mohit Joshi, President; of course, Rajesh, CFO; and all the other leadership team who made it happen.", "So I think all in all, the company is well poised now. And under Salil\u2019s leadership, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take it to greater heights. So with these brief comments, are there any questions that you have on Board-related matters, or on any of the four, five things I talked about.", "Operator", "Thank you. With this, I hand over the floor back to the management for the proceedings. Over to you, sir.", "Salil Parekh", "Good evening and good morning and wish you a Happy New Year. I\u2019m Salil Parekh, Chief Executive Officer of Infosys. I\u2019m joined here by my colleagues: Pravin, Chief Operating Officer; and Ranga, our Chief Financial Officer; and several members of our leadership team.", "It\u2019s a privilege of me to have this opportunity to lead Infosys. I would like to thank Nandan and the Board for having put their trust in me. I\u2019ve been in the technology industry for several years and I have always have a deep admiration and respect to what Infosys stood for.", "In my first few days in this role, I\u2019ve been energized by the people I\u2019ve met here. Whether they are individuals starting in the tech world or senior leaders, each has a real passion for their work and has pride in being part of Infosys and a deep commitment to its values. The clients I\u2019ve reached out to have responded with messages that underscore and endorse the strong partnership that Infosys is doing with them over the years. There\u2019s a real delight in the way they see Infosys and the work we do for them.", "The market, of course, has exciting opportunities and new areas of growth. Digital disruption today is impacting all our clients, as the industry is undergoing massive change. At Infosys, we have a strong foundation of our business. And as you\u2019ll hear, our Q3 results confirm this.", "We have over 1,100 clients that trust us 200,000 passionate employees. We work across a broad array of sectors and service offers.

I think, the senior management attrition is a bit normal to a service industry, especially the IT industry.

So do you believe or do you have a confidence to say that the second line management set up is now very strong, and one can successfully transition whenever such challenges comes?", "Nandan Nilekani", "Well, absolutely. I think, Infosys has a very strong leadership, very deep bench. We have great people at the helm. We have great people who are also in the next level. So I\u2019m very, very confident. I\u2019m very confident that things will go well going forward. And I think, Salil will spend a lot of time on leadership development.

Please go ahead.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thank you, and I wish all of you a Happy New Year and a warm welcome to Sandeep as well. I had two questions. My first question was addressed to Salil. We do appreciate the fact that you\u2019ve just spent a few days at Infosys. But based on your discussions during the recruitment process and based on what you often see from your Capgemini days. Do you foresee any area of significant investments need to be made?", "Salil Parekh", "Hi, Anantha, thank you for that. As I said, the time spent over the next two or three months is going to be around the four pillars, which will build upon the strategy refresh that Nandan has launched. Coming out of that, we will in a set of strategic priorities that we want to drive, we will hold an Investor Day in in April to talk about it. At this stage, I\u2019ve not developed any clear view in the few days I\u2019ve been here in terms of the question you asked for investment thesis.", "Anantha Narayan", "Okay, that\u2019s probably fair. And for my second question, has Rajesh\u2019s portfolio been reassigned?", "Salil Parekh", "At this stage, the portfolio, I will work directly with those areas. Over coming days and weeks, we will find the way to more efficiently distribute it.", "Anantha Narayan", "Thank you and good luck, Salil.", "Salil Parekh", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from JM Financial. Please go ahead.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Yes, hi. Congratulations on a decent quarter and welcome, Salil. My first question is on the implied guidance for the next quarter that seems to be quite broad for the fourth quarter. So I\u2019m just curious why we have given broadly, is it something to do with the environment, or any client specific situation, which makes you a little uncertain on the near-term?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, this is Ranga here. If you look at the first nine months, revenue growth has completed the first nine months of previous year. We are growing at 5.6% in constant currency and our guidance is 5.5% to 6.5%. I think, we are focusing on Q4 execution. And to just answer your prior question, I know there are no specific client consensus that we are foreseeing at this juncture.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Okay. And Ranga, if you can give some color and what kind of tax rate we should presume for the next couple of years, given the APA, as well as some of the tax benefits that you mentioned can come to us post the changes in the U.S. taxation?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "So let me first address the APA part. As you know, as we announced earlier this week, APA provides the better predictability, because the methodology of both allocating the revenues and computing the pre-tax income is laid out. So, as we said in the earlier press release, we expect the overall effective tax rates to be lower about 100 basis points on account of APA for the period covered under APA, which is 2011 to 2021.", "Now coming to the broader U.S. tax reforms, there are multiple elements in the tax reforms. While we have been with a preliminary assessment at this stage, but overall we feel that the \u2013 this contribute to the United States.", "Pankaj Kapoor", "Got it. Thank you and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Edward Caso", "Hi, thank you. Your utilization has been running record levels here. How high it has to be raised the bar? I mean, how much more is there to go? And Salil, welcome.", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, this is Ranga here. As you know, utilization you can look at last couple of quarters where we have been focusing. It has gone up significantly, as you rightly pointed out, we are at 84.9. Same quarter last year was 81.9, so full increase of 3 percentage. But from here on these \u2013 the runway balance, I agree is quite limited. And that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re also in addition to utilization and focusing on other elements, which they had talked about.", "For example, earlier quarters, we had talked about on-site mix moderation. And if you look at over the last three, four quarters, the on-site mix has come down from 30% to 29%. So I think and similarly on the on-site employee costs as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months has come down to 38.3% from 39%. So we\u2019re looking at multiple levers. But to specifically answer your question, yes, on the utilization front, certainly the run rate is limited.", "Edward Caso", "Great. And I had a question about taxes to people in the United States. I believe you\u2019re sort of working still with the fresher model in the U.S. to a large part. How is that going? Are you able to access people, given the very tight labor market for IT professionals in the U.S.? Thank you.", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here. As you are aware, we have committed to recruiting 10,000 people over the next two years. And in the last two quarters, since we have not made that announcement, we have made that good progress. We have been going to Tier 1 and Tier 2 colleges, as well as community colleges. And we have had a fair amount of success in recruitment. So we don\u2019t see that as a challenge.", "We are also setting up innovation and technology hubs, where we have already inaugurated the first one in Indianapolis. We\u2019ll announce one shortly in Raleigh, North Carolina, so we\u2019ll probably over the next few quarters, we will identify two or three more locations to do that. So our U.S. talent plan is really underway and kicking well, progressing extremely well. And at this stage, we are not seeing any significant roadblocks.", "Edward Caso", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.", "Apurva Prasad", "Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Salil. So I had a question on the client metric. So if I look at the top 10 and top 25, you seem to decline in this quarter. Should anything be really read into this?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, this is Ranga here. I think, that seasonally, the sequential quarter basis, there will be some changes. But I would encourage to look at the nine-month over nine-month metrics for the year-on-year metrics. For example, if you look at the top 25 accounts, look at 4.8% at quarter-on-quarter compared to the last year, that is Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year.", "So I think \u2013 and also Q3 typically has furloughed. Some of our top clients have second furlough impacts during the quarter, which can in the short-term can distort these numbers. But overall, I think, better indicator in our opinion is to look at the YOY change. So YOY, top 25 has grown at 4.8%.", "Apurva Prasad", "Sure, that\u2019s helpful. But if you can talk about if we\u2019re gaining share within top accounts?", "Pravin", "Yes, this is Pravin here. I think, in many of our accounts, they are definitely gaining shares. There\u2019s lot of effort in terms of mining accounts better. And if you look at the last few quarters, we have had a significant wins in large deal as well and good percentage of them are rebates and renewals and so on. So there have been a lot of focused efforts in the last few quarters and most of the accounts, we are in the top two from a market share perspective.", "Apurva Prasad", "Sure. Thanks, and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani from Citibank. Please go ahead.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Hi, this is Arvind Ramnani from Keybanc. Salil, welcome to Infosys. We\u2019re pleased that Infosys was able to recruit you. You have a terrific background and reputation. And I know, it\u2019s probably premature to comment on your priority that Infosys and you will give us an update in April. I\u2019m sure, you certainly have a view of the industry given your background. So my question really is, what is your view of the IT services industry? And specifically, what are they key opportunities and risks and how do you think the industry should address these risks?", "Salil Parekh", "Thank you, and thank you for the question. I think, with respect to the sector and the industry, the good news is that significant areas of growth opportunity today in the market. As you know well, these areas are broadly classified under the name Digital. It will cover a lot of different things for different people.", "So the areas of data and analytics, IoT and industrial Internet, the whole area of cloud from SaaS to hybrid cloud management to the migrations, digital customer experience, security, AI, machine learning. So these are massive areas of opportunities for growth in the sector.", "In terms of areas where there\u2019s challenges, I think, the overall sector is shifting to a much more business-driven tech agenda to the business. The buyer is \u2013 not just the CIO, but there\u2019s also the business user. And so many of the ways and means of interacting with clients used to evolve if you look at that. So that\u2019s my perspective on the sector. It\u2019s an exciting sector, but there\u2019s a transformation in the sector, and the players in the sector need to have agility to be playing in the new areas.", "Arvind Ramnani", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi. I\u2019d like to ask a similar question to the past one. But I\u2019d specifically like to focus on gross margins. If you look across the IT services industry with very few exceptions, including Infosys, gross margins continue to erode and go lower. And I\u2019d like to understand your perspective on, what\u2019s the opportunity for the Indian-based providers to at a minimum stop the gross margin erosion?", "And how you think the mix plays out as you\u2019re trying to increase the amount of business from digital, which I think near-term erodes margins? How do you balance that new market opportunities for the Indian-based providers? So the real question is, can you talk a little bit about gross margin issues in the industry, and how the Indian-based providers combat the erosion to the gross margin line?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, this is Ranga here. Yes, you\u2019re right. I think, the gross margin declines have been quite visible. If you look at our cost structure, as you know, 80% of our operating expenses even the cost of revenue expenses is the employee cost.", "Now if you look at slice that employee cost, 40%, in our case, close to 40% of our revenue is from on-site employee cost, add to that another 16%, 16.5% offshore, so total 56.6%. So the key thing is, how do we ensure that for the on-site cost that we incur, what are the corresponding billing rates concomitant to the cost equity income, which essentially means going back to the pyramid.", "Now a way to look at it is, hey, here is the tradition mighty service. Here is the pyramid. Can I optimize the pyramid, make sure, now for example, right now we\u2019re hiring the freshers in the United States as part of the pyramid in the on-site, a need we still have on pyramid structure with freshers intake at the bottom of the pyramid only in India. So there are some opportunities coming and even the propensity of the clients to affect fresh graduates on-site is slowly picking up. So that\u2019s one way to look at the addressing the on-site employee costs.", "The second way, which is also more sustainable is really, as you pointed out, how could we price our new services, including digital at higher price points? As you\u2019d noted, even this quarter, sequentially, our new services grew close to 7% sequentially, seven times the regular company growth, and it\u2019s almost now 9.9% of our revenue. Now, if this robust growth is coupled with higher price points for these would also be beneficial to our gross margin.", "So in summary, I think, we need to look at the revenue mix. How much of that revenue mix is coming from \u2013 the incremental revenue mix comes from the new services, which are more profitable. And at the same time, how do we address the pyramid, as well as the cost structure issues. In the core IT services, we need to do both hand in hand. So that\u2019s really the way to look at the gross margin.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Thank you very much. I look forward to your April Analyst event.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Hi, thanks for the opportunity, and welcome, Salil. I had one question on BFSI. One of your peers indicated that there\u2019s near-term uncertainty on BFSI, driven by clients finalizing their digital architecture. And secondly, deciding a location between in-house and outsourced. So you seem to be sounding much more positive near-term in terms of BFSI. So what exactly is driving this optimism? Is this deal flow? Is it portfolio differences? So some color would be helpful?", "Mohit Joshi", "Hi, this is Mohit. So if you look at it, the insurance growth has been very strong. I guess, your question is more on banking piece. And what I\u2019ll say is, while there are individual clients, right, the individual clients may have ramp ups or ramp downs. But overall \u2013 the overall spend position is stable. And while we expect that, there\u2019ll be some sort of movement, right, from more of a regulatory spend, more of growth-oriented spend. But we\u2019re quite comfortable with the position that Pravin had shown.", "But for our calendar year 2018 perspective, we see spend has been stable for the sector. In certain sectors or in certain sub-sectors like in regional banks, for instance, we\u2019ve seen the fact that clients are having to do a lot of catch-up. So they\u2019re investing significantly more in terms of their digital or their mobile strategy. In some other sub-sectors like asset management, for instance, where about a year-and-half ago, we\u2019ve seen fairly significant cuts. We\u2019ve seen those sectors come back competitively from a spend perspective.", "So the overall picture is \u2013 not is \u2013 not as hazy or as negative as it was a year ago. And if you\u2019ve seen from our performance in Q3 itself, compared to our peer group, we have done well. So obviously, it is mixed, right, it is mixed across sub-sectors and geographies.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay.", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here. I just wanted to add. I just wanted to reiterate that while in quarter three, our performance was muted, particularly in banking space. But that\u2019s primarily due to higher than expected furloughs and slowness in ramp up of some of the large deals that we have in the past.", "Our competitive positioning in this space is very strong and reflected in the kind of growth we had in last few quarters. And as Mohit said, we remain positive on the segment and we expect to see calendar year 2018 spend come back and much better than what we have seen this year.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. And just one more, in terms of wage hikes, you had push backs in the cycle this year. Going into the next year, what is the wage hike cycle that you\u2019re looking at?", "Pravin Rao", "So we\u2019re yet to start thinking about next year. Right now, our focus is on executing on quarter four. But sometime during this quarter, we\u2019ll start looking at next year on the overall, I think, revenues across and wage hikes and et cetera. So we\u2019ll probably be in a better position to comment on it at the beginning of April.", "Ashwin Mehta", "Okay. Thanks a lot and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Viju George from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Viju George", "Yes, thank you for the opportunity. I think, all my questions have been answered. A very warm welcome to Salil. Okay, that\u2019s it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Nandan Nilekani", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Bergin", "Hi, thank you. Salil, congratulations. I wanted to ask on a large BFS deals. I give you a better 2018 calendar outlook. Can you comment on the type of deals that those were, including the kind of activities that you\u2019re doing there, whether they\u2019re net new work, whether they\u2019re more traditional or digital engagements?", "Salil Parekh", "Look, I think, from a BFSI perspective, right, like I said, there is a pivot that is happening now, more from regulatory-oriented spend, from more a digital-oriented spend this year, right? So that is one key thing.", "The second thing is, if you look at the fact that we have platforms as well. So whether you look at McCamish or you look at Silicon, we have a significant demand for platform-oriented businesses, so that\u2019s the second piece.", "And the third piece is, the overall sector sentiment, right? There are individual banks that are still looking at cost cuts. But the overall sector sentiment is positive. And that is based \u2013 that reflects the commentary that we made today.", "Bryan Bergin", "Okay. And Salil, understanding, you just started, can you comment your personal views on M&A as an avenue for growth in the current digital services environment?", "Salil Parekh", "Again, the view I\u2019ve taken is take the next two or three months to begin to relook at us strategic refresh along the four dimensions the markets, clients, people and service offerings. Today, the environment and given that we have a very strong balance sheet, we will look clearly as a \u2013 M&A as a very strategic opportunity, but no decisions have been made. We\u2019re starting to evaluate that carefully to be further sort of prioritize around the April Investor Day.", "Bryan Bergin", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna Group. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman", "Hi, thanks for getting back in here. Ranga, I just want to mention that was a great response that you had with regard to employee costs to the earlier question. I had a more straightforward question, Ranga. I didn\u2019t hear you say it, but is there some change in your tax rate assumption going forward, based on the dynamics in the U.S. tax market?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, this is Ranga here. I think, what I was commenting earlier for the similar question earlier was, on account of signing of our Advance Price Agreement, we expect our overall effective tax rate to be lower by about 100 basis points for the period covered under APA, which is 2011 to 2021.", "Coming to the second part of your question on the U.S. tax reform, there are multiple elements in the U.S. tax reforms. One is, of course, the reduction in the tax rates by several others. We have made preliminary assessment of the impact. And based on the preliminary assessment, the impact is neutral for us.", "James Friedman", "Got it, just writing that down. And then Pravin, I want to ask you one as well. With your prepared remarks, you commented on the improved dynamic in European outsourcing, not a new narrative, but clearly there\u2019s results here for it. Where are we in that journey, Pravin? How do you see that as we move forward for the next line of sight in European outsourcing? Thank you.", "Pravin Rao", "So I think when you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s happening in the market that is tremendous focus by clients across industries in terms of transforming their businesses and investing in newer areas.", "So this is actually pressurizing them to look at ways and means to cut cost and review the cost on the other side of the business, and it is actually translating into Nordics. And as compared to North America and Europe, they have been probably not as aggressive as North America. And so that\u2019s exactly today translating into a much more aggressive push for vendor consolidation in Nordics and so on.", "On the other side of the business, so they will say, they can throw back on changing the business. So that is the phenomenon we\u2019re seeing, and we have been fairly successful in passing to this opportunity and converting a fair amount of this piece that have come our way.", "James Friedman", "Thank you very much. All the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead. Diviya Nagarajan, your line is on muted, you may go ahead with your question, please.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Just a clarification on the demand outlook. Can you hear me now?", "Operator", "Yes, we can hear you, ma\u2019am. Thank you.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Yes. So on the demand outlook, could you just help me understand between the BFS segment and the retail segment, where do you have greater confidence in outlook of your recovery? Is my understanding correct that you are more confident about BFS, or retail, or could you just correct me, if I\u2019m wrong, please.", "Salil Parekh", "I think, we are fairly confident about BFS being, again, better than what we have seen this year and coming back. We had a good quarter on the retail. And CPG side, we had a good quarter after several quarters. And primarily driven by lot of opportunities in European retailers and CPG companies and also from North America. But when you look at what\u2019s happening in the space, given all the structural changes, there\u2019s lot of investments going on. And our belief is that we are able to bring our capability to bear. We should be able to capture some of the investments that are out there.", "Unlike BFSI, it\u2019s \u2013 in my mind, it\u2019s probably a little bit early to comment whether this spend will continue for retail, but we\u2019re hopeful at this stage.", "Diviya Nagarajan", "Got it. Thank you, and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Dave Conning from Baird. Please go ahead.", "Dave Conning", "Yes. hey, guys, thank for taking the call. And I guess, first of all, just just to make sure we\u2019re clear on this. In Q4, other income should come down maybe a third sequentially or so because of the cash you just used. And then what\u2019s the share count be in Q4, just so we get that, right?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, the share count came down by 4.92%, that was exactly the buyback. And if you look at our factsheet we have provided give weighted average shares post buyback. And coming to the first question, yes, to some extent, the other income is impacted by the interest income that we earn from the balances. So that is something that I know we paid $2 billion and also the interim dividend during the quarter. So to that extent, yes, the other income comprising interest income can have \u2013 can see some change.", "Dave Conning", "Okay. Okay, thank you. And then \u2013 and I guess, secondly, one more thing on the tax rate. If we add back the $225 million to Q3, your tax rate this quarter would have been 30%, which is the highest in many years. Is that the normal tax rate now that like to kind of start basing everything off of like, was there something that\u2019s changed a little bit to make it higher now on an ongoing basis than it\u2019s been?", "Salil Parekh", "No, actually on an ongoing basis, as I said, our overall effective tax rates last couple of quarters has been 28%, 29% range. This particular quarter apart from this, as you know, we had \u2013 we have disclosed in the financial statement our subsidiary BPO paying dividend to us. So there is a dividend distribution tax, those that can be offset against our dividend distribution tax. But technically for accounting purposes, we had to take show it has the tax expense.", "Dave Conning", "So how should we think about the like \u2013 so if I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts between tax reform, the APA benefit and stuff. I mean, does that all aggregate to a pretty normal ongoing tax rate around 28%?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Well, I think coming to the APA, as we have disclosed earlier, because of the APA, we expect our overall effective tax rates to come down by 100 basis points for the period covered under that APA, which is 2011 to 2021. Now, we have also made preliminary assessment of the U.S. tax reform and the measures proposed under the \u2013 rather approved under the U.S. tax reform.", "Our preliminary assessment indicates that, the overall impact is neutral for us. So there are two parts: the tax reform impact is neutral, the APA is about 100 basis point reduction in the overall effective tax rates for the period covered under APA.", "Dave Conning", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Elara Securities. Please go ahead.", "Ravi Menon", "Hi. Thank you for the opportunity and welcome aboard, Salil. While it\u2019s too early to ask how you \u2013 from you regarding Infosys strategy. But since you\u2019ve been a long-term industry participant and in a very key role. In your view, how Indian IT firms been slightly slow to adapt to the technology shift underway? And do you think that there is a change required in the model itself as new technology requires a different kind of skill set profile, deep technical expertise in multiple elements of the stack, good domain expertise as well? And would you view these as not being compatible at the traditional pyramid model for Indian IT services?", "Salil Parekh", "Thank you. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of the question. But let me start with the first. I think, it\u2019s difficult to characterize all companies whether they\u2019re from India from other geographies in a particular grouping with where they stand on the transformation journey. There are different nuances of different companies. And generally in the market, I think, there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s going on in different components of the digital spectrum.", "As you know well, there\u2019s a whole component around the marketing and interactive side. There\u2019s a component around the industrial Internet, and there\u2019s a component around cloud and its different iterations. And different companies across the sector, not just from India or others, have strength that has developed in specific areas. That\u2019s the way, at least, I\u2019ve seen how the industries evolve. So I don\u2019t have a view of one grouping being in a position, which benefits or does not benefit.", "And the second part of your question, I didn\u2019t catch, if you could repeat that, please?", "Ravi Menon", "Yes, second part was several change required in the model itself as new technology requires a different kind of skill set profile with deep technical expertise in multiple elements of the stack, good domain expertise as well. And do you think that this is not really compatible with a traditional pyramid model for Indian IT?", "Salil Parekh", "Well, first, I think, the pyramid model applies to almost every business I\u2019ve seen within the IT sector, whether it\u2019s from India or from anywhere. In General, I think, it\u2019s skill sets that are needed in some of the newer areas require that there needs to be some level of re-skilling or indeed to recruiting from college that type of skilling that needs to come in.", "So those implications, I think, are independent of where the company is from. It depends on the portfolio that the company has in terms of its current service offer. So again, the pyramid, I think, approach at least applies to most companies that I\u2019m familiar within the sector.", "Ravi Menon", "Great, thank you. And Pravin, just a quick question. In the press conference, you mentioned that Infosys is positioning Nia with some new thinking. Could you please elaborate on that statement?", "Pravin Rao", "Can you repeat the question, please?", "Ravi Menon", "In the press conference, you mentioned that Infosys is repositioning Nia with some new thinking. Could you elaborate on that?", "Pravin Rao", "Yes, we have had \u2013 as you are aware, we had good success in Nia over the last few quarters. But at the beginning of last quarter when we did the strategy refresh exercise, we looked at all aspects of our business, including Nia on what is working and what is not working. And one of the opportunities we found in Nia was, right now we have opportunities more at horizontal solutions.", "We felt that, looking at what was happening and the differentiated position of Nia different to our build up time, our ability to monetize would be much better if you\u2019re able to build vertical solutions on top of Nia. So that is a strategic shift that we have done and it\u2019s been probably a quarter since we have done that and that\u2019s focusing on executing on that.", "Ravi Menon", "Great. Thank you, and best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Sandip Agarwal from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.", "Sandip Agarwal", "Yes. So I have a question, which probably Pravin or maybe Salil can as well add. So first of all, warm welcome to Salil, and best of luck for your new role, and thanks for giving me the opportunity to ask a question. So my question is little bottom of what I\u2019m trying to understand here is that, with Europe firing better than earlier and digital doing well, BFSI looking optimistic, retail looking good, and energy with oil prices going up and again, communication probably is not worsening further. Will it be safe to say that CY 2018 looks much more promising than CY 2017, and probably the worst of the growth is behind. I\u2019m not asking for any guidance, but just trying to understand?", "Salil Parekh", "It\u2019s perhaps too early to comment on that. As I said earlier, right now our target is to make sure we execute on quarter four. For us, I think, the last few year, quarter four has been initially soft quarter. And this time, we want to make sure that we execute a decent trade and which will help us going forward.", "At the same time in this quarter, we\u2019ll have the benefit of \u2013 certainly, we\u2019re getting to details about the strategy refresh exercise, as well as resulted time, and we also step back and take a look at the pipeline and the future. So April is perhaps the better time for us to respond to this question.", "Sandip Agarwal", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Mukul Garg from Haitong Securities. Please go ahead.", "Mukul Garg", "Thanks for giving me the opportunity, and a very warm welcome to Salil. Ranga, the first question is on the on-site mix, which you have highlighted as one of the drivers, which should be further improved. Should we look at this on a near-term basis, or do you think there is space for improvement even on the medium-term, especially on the back of the upcoming hiring, which you have committed in U.S. over the next two years?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "Hi, this is Ranga here. Yes, towards the last couple of quarters, like I said, that we\u2019re focused on on-site mix and it had moderated from the level of 30% to 39.8% and 39.4% last quarter and now 29%. However, the on-site mix is, as you rightly said, is also a derivative of the business mix. And for example, certain service lines like, for example, test chamber, infrastructure management make themselves more amenable for on-site mix moderation. Typically, they have larger companies that offshore.", "However, some of the new services, as well as the consulting and other services typically offset heavy. So I think, the business mix change is one factor. If you look at the broadest level, which can have an effect on the on-site mix. But most specifically, what we have also done over the last couple of quarters is to look at more granular at the service line level and also look for opportunities for the on-site mix moderation.", "And there the focus primarily has been on the fixed price projects, because in case of T&M, when we try to moderate the on-site mix, there\u2019s the impact on the revenue using a quite linear. But as in case of a fixed price projects, the moderation of on-site mix through productivity and others do not \u2013 they merely impact the revenue.", "So I think we need to work on multiple components here. So that\u2019s what we have done. So we don\u2019t want to kind of give any specific target for the medium-term or something, but we\u2019ll continue to work on it.", "Mukul Garg", "So maybe, if I can ask this question in a slightly different way. You are planning to hire about 10,000 employees in U.S. over the next two years. And if you look at your recent net hiring levels, they do not suggest a significant ramp up of hiring in India itself. So won\u2019t that work against optimization of on-site mix further in the medium-term?", "Ranganath Mavinakere", "No, I think if you \u2013 referring to the hiring part. Hiring part necessarily is not means all is net headcount, right? It is also a churn of people. These are dependent/independent people. So to some extent that will also address the replacement of, I think, people on certain projects. So it\u2019s not necessarily mean that the entire 10,000 is totally incremental to the existing. So I think, there are a couple of pieces there as well.", "So overall, our focus on on-site mix is a combination of business mix, as well as in FP projects in the current service portfolio by service plan how do we address this I think that will be the result of these two elements.", "Mukul Garg", "Understood. And if I may ask one question to Pravin. Pravin, you mentioned that digital is now close 25%. And you will probably give us more break-up of what the growth going forward? But can you help us understand, what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of size now, digital has been one of the sector areas in the market for a while now? So have you seen digital actually scaling up and becoming larger business line by itself in terms of individual orders of \u2013 we recently heard one of your larger peers talk about a reasonably large digital deal win. So are you also seeing something similar?", "Pravin Rao", "So as we said earlier, our share of revenue from digital has crossed 25%. We will probably start reporting that in the next coming quarters on an ongoing basis. In the last couple of quarters, we have started talking about new services and plus share of revenue from that. And that is a subset of digital. And as you have seen this quarter, it has grown by #6.8%, and today it\u2019s about 11.6% of our revenues.", "So that is the kind of growth and overall we have grown at 1%. The growth from new services and software has been about 6.8%. So that is the kind of impact we can see. And digital is a common theme across industry verticals, because everywhere we\u2019re seeing plans looking at new business models, improved customer interface, digitization and so on. And the definition of the digital also in some sense is very broad.", "So one part of the retail definition is about cloud. And if you today look at any large deal, there is an element of cloud in that. And if you use that hypothesis then there are already, I mean, in the past also, there have always been many large deals with significant component of digital in that.", "So I would not like to comment. I mean, we continue to see traction. We continue to expect increased momentum in digital across verticals. But I would not like to really comment on the size, because on the basis of definition itself, we have already seen large size digital deals.", "Mukul Garg", "Understand. Thanks for answering my question. Best of luck from my side.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from CIMB. Please go ahead.", "Sandeep Shah", "Yes, thanks, and welcome, Salil, and all the best. Just the question is, in terms of the 4Q guidance, so if I look at the higher-end, it is 3.1% Q-on-Q growth. While last four years if you look at, except for one year, three quarters in three years, you had a sequential decline. So what gives you confidence to retain your higher-end of the guidance at 3.1% this time. So what could be the deal wins, which can result into some amount of optimism or breaking the jinx?", "Salil Parekh", "I think, I should not read too much into this beyond the fact that only one fact, which I would like to mention here is, if you look at the first nine months of this year, the revenue growth as compared to the first nine months of previous year, in constant currency, we have grown at 5.6%. And our current guidance is 5.5% to 6.5%. And as you know, we had reduced the guidance last quarter.", "So I think, right now, as Pravin had mentioned earlier, the deal momentum that we have seen in the earlier quarters, we\u2019re focusing on ramping up some of them. And I think, the focus is clearly to have good execution in Q4. At the same time, we\u2019re also very, as you rightly mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very much aware of the fact that the exit rate of Q4 is important to leave it and that will really be important for the FY 2019 point of view. So we\u2019re all working towards the execution.", "Sandeep Shah", "Okay. Just last question, on the large deal pipeline, some of your peers, as well as industry consultant says that the pipeline is robust and the decision-making or conversion of the pipeline is actually accelerating or increasing. Do you also witness the same? And is it broad-based across industry segment?", "Pravin Rao", "This is Pravin here. The pipeline is strong. I agree with that assessment. But the digital cycle continue to be strong and continue to be long. It takes anywhere from six to nine months from the beginning to close from an average. But we have not seen accelerated decision making. And by and large, it is broad-based. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing lot more. I have seen in the past lot more large deals in the ECF space and in the FX space. We have seen half pockets in manufacturing and RCL. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t say any pattern in that. I mean, it really depends on when deals come up for renewal and renewal cycles and so on.", "Sandeep Shah", "Okay. Okay, thanks, and all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question for today. I would now like to hand over the floor back to the management for any closing comments. Over to you, sir.", "Salil Parekh", "Thank you.

Overall, the fundamentals of our business, growth, operating margin and cash generation are really in a healthy position.", "We also have a pristine balance sheet, which has been used in the past and we will continue to use in the future as we evolve the capital allocation policy. Our governance now is stable. And with that, we now look at our strategic priorities that we\u2019ll lay out at the April Investor Day.

Overall, as a company, we have all of those elements coming together, look forward to meeting with several of you at the April Investor Day.
